Compared to the consistent sound of Reznor 's previous records , this one is certainly a departure . More beat oriented , less guitar textures , and verse chorus verse . He seems more confident and less dark , vocally . Different , but a good listen . I am not going to analyze the sequences , but it is a new direction for Trent , and this album takes a few listens to appreciate .	1
First off , thanks for not making me wait years for a new NIN album . This concept album is d*mn good , too . And the fact that the CD changes color when you play it and reveals a secret message ? Just icing on the cake . Trent Reznor is a marketing genius .	1
1st listen through I liked it.5th listen through , I love it ! The one thing this Album reminds me of is `` Mezzanine '' by Massive Attack . While it sounds DISTINCTLY NIN I just get a Massive Attack vibe from it , and that is a very good thing , most of the songs are mid-tempo very bassy , very electronic . The album really tells a story , its amazing.Standout Tracks : The Good Soldier/Vessel ( play them as one song ) Capital G ( Very poppy and groove sounding ) The Great Destroyer ( Awesome , the song literally gets destroyed halfway through ) Another Version of the Truth ( A good sad track ) Zero Sum ( Best ending track I have heard in a long time ) Those were just some of my favorites , but honestly to tell you the truth , almost NONE of the songs on the album were fillers , they were ALL great , some of Reznor 's best work since the Fragile . ( I personally feel as if The Downward Spiral is a little overrated [ most NIN fans would kill me for saying so ] )	1
Trent Reznor has never really been a bundle of sunshine , but he reaches a new level of darkness in Nine Inch Nails ' `` Year Zero . `` It 's a pessimistic view of what the world might be in 2022 , if all of society were to decay ( which does n't really happen , but still ... ) . And he unleashes this nihilism in a sweeping , razor-edged concept album , full of pointed lyrics and ominous electro-rock.It opens with the rapid drums of `` Hyperpower , '' an intro that weaves in some fuzzy bass and spasmodic electronica . It segues into a tight , spare hard-rocker with squiggling synth , with Reznor being drowned out as he sings , `` Down on your knees/You 'll be left behind/This is the beginning/Watch what you think/They can read your mind ... '' The songs that follow are suitably bleak hard-rockers laced with synth -- the undulating creepy `` Survivalism , '' slow-burning hard-rock ballads , explosive muscular rockers , razor-edged electrorock , and the rapid smash'n'rapping of `` Capital G , '' which is unsurprisingly about a certain president . `` Year Zero '' is a tight coil of nihilistic rock , unwinding to show off its dark message as the songs go on . While society has never utterly crumbled all at once , this album sounds like the soundtrack to the ultimate apocalypse movie , with hints of oppression and corruption from all sides.His music is basically a combination of hammering bass and drums and a tight muscular guitar . There 's also that classic electronic edge -- jabs of steely synth sometimes , squealing screeches at others , and frenetic squidges at others . It 's all twisted together into ominous , unstoppable melodies.And Reznor howls out haunting songs , which are full of misery , numbness , some rather excessive jabs at religion , jagged political barbs , laments , and sometimes gleeful anger ( `` Come on down , my friend/It 's time to meet your MASTER ! '' ) . The rapping sound was a bad idea , though -- it sounds too forthright for the rest of the album.But there seems to be a faint glimmer of hope in the final song , where he intones `` May God have mercy on our dirty little hearts , '' and relates , `` And I guess I just wanted to tell you , as the lights start to fade , /That you are the reason that I am not afraid ... as the heavens will fall , /We will be together soon if we will be anything at all . '' It ends with windy synth and a delicate piano outro.Darkness and pessimism rule `` Year Zero , '' a blistering and tightly written ode to a bleak worst-case-scenario future . Dark , ominous and thoroughly amazing .	1
Its the music that I care about - all this `` Year 2022 '' hype and all the publicity stunts just bore me . Year Zero is a very good CD so it can stand on its own . I love the bass-heavy tracks and very slick way each track is put together . I recommend listening to Year Zero on a decent system with good speakers instead of headphones , to get the full effect of the CD .	1
I 'm being very kind with my review . I 'm also going to make it shorter than my review for With Teeth . Musically speaking , Year Zero is quite an achievement . Its like a Drum and Bass Noise-Rock Electronica masterpiece , that is until the forgetable ( and boring ) singing takes the music in a different direction . Half the time he is just talking on this album . It also doesnt help that the lyrics are self-centered opinions and cheesy concepts . I dont expect Trent to be angry anymore , but I was hoping that he would be able to make his vocals and lyrics stand apart from everyone else like he always did in the past . I almost cried when I heard the vocal delivery on Capital G. Bottom line is this : the music is fantastic , prolly the best brooding noise/electronica I 've heard in almost a decade . However , the vocals are trite and boring , nothing you havent heard from a million other boring bands . I never though I would say that about NIN . Everyone 's got an opinion on the world yadda yadda yadda . I agree with the others that said this would have been fantastic as an instrumental album . I guess Year Zero ( and With Teeth for that matter ) would have had a better turn-out had Trent stuck to singing about internal darkness and the human condition . Politics and concepts make for tedious listenings . I do n't see the next one being better . That is all .	1
Trent Reznor pretty much invented and defined early industrial music and nearly singlehandedly created a genre . It is fitting , perhaps , that with the release of `` Year Zero '' he redefines it 's possibilities and uses it to deliver much-needed political protest they way only he can . Both artistically and musically , this is perhaps the best industrial album ever created.Full of Reznor 's trademark fear and loathing , this album reaches greater heights because of it 's conceptual nature . Although he has covered this ground before ( The excellent `` Downward Spiral '' was certainly conceptual in nature ) , this time around he delivers a vision of a full-fledged dystopian near-future America , in which Christianity is the official state religion , citizens are under surveillance by the `` United States Bureau Of Morality '' , and mysterious aliens may have finally decided to wipe us out like the virus we are . Compelling and topical stuff.Musically , this disc delivers the nihilistic machine-like weirdness the way only Reznor can . Full of the requisite programmed drumming , off-kilter distorted guitar riffs mutated and bent beyond recognition by signal processing , and throbbing bursts of static and nearly ( but not quite ) recognizable noises and sounds , this may be the first `` progressive '' industrial album . Very , very cool and original , even if you do n't like NIN . Recommended .	1
Year Zero is part one of a two disc concept album about the future of America . Recorded with the help of Garageband Pro , Trent Reznor provides us a glimpse into an all but possible reality in the coming years . The marketing he used to promote the album was very fascinating indeed . Faux websites , video clips and other forms of multimedia . The album is a step up from With Teeth , We get an angry and motivated Trent Reznor . The previous was a self pity and bitter album , which is good but this one is awesome . The way this country is headed and if we do n't do something about it , Year Zero will become a reality . If you enjoy concept albums or are a big fan of NIN , go out and get this disc ! It 's not that expensive and it comes with a slick lyric booklet and a color changing disc .	1
I have been a Nine Inch Nails fan only for a few years.. My Nine Inch Nails collection began with there album Broken and I worked my way up from there.. What I 've always liked about Nine Inch Nails and there music is on the production side.. the instrumental side alone is just out of this world and insane.. Trent 's voice and the passion and emotion that he delivers through out most of his work is very good as well.. and compliments the music very nicely.. When With Teeth came out I was expecting another great album ( I was listening to The Fragile often around that time.. ) but With Teeth was just not great at all.. Yeah there were a couple tracks that I listened to and liked but it was nowhere near the level of The Fragile and The Downward Spiral..When I heard that Nine Inch Nails new album Year Zero was coming out I automatically thought and said to myself.. `` Not going to get it.. just going to be a waste of money.. '' but after hearing the album on the Nine Inch Nails official website the other night.. the next morning before class I went out and got it..This Year Zero album is very good My favorite tracks so far are `` The Good Soldier '' And `` The Beginning Of The End '' .. I can listen to this whole album and not skip one track.. This is the Nine Inch Nails material that I want.. A major improvement from With Teeth..What I do n't like about this album though is that it 's very political.. and against George Bush . Now I 'm not one that is very fond of George Bush myself.. I 'm not too fond of politics for that matter.. But to me music should be away from politics.. Music should be something that you can escape from all the politics and not have to worry about listening to someone putting down your own views as far as `` Republican '' or `` Democrat '' in a way it 's disrespectful.. Music should be open to everybody no matter what your political party is.. But then again.. it 's not like artists are forcing us to believe how they do.. right ? Get this album.. very good stuff.. I 'm sure I will be listening to this album more and more..Justin	1
Nine inch nails have awesome albums as this one . The production is for another time excellent and you can hear industrial music with the correct depth in sound . The tracks gives you a cool & lt ; > feeling . This album reminds me The fragile a little bit . The vocals are really great ( I love the tone , pitch and the color of his voice ) . If you are familiar with Nine inch nails you will probably like this album . Its not a masterpiece but a good one .	1
Nine Inch Nails is one of those bands that will never really be able to live up to the massive success of their breakthrough album . `` The Downward Spiral '' was such an influential , massively successful album that nothing Trent Reznor ever does will be able to top it , but everything he does will be constantly compared to it . This might not matter so much if Trent Reznor was not the musical genius he is . If he was content to sit back and make a living by imitating the sound of `` Spiral '' , it would only be fair that he would never top it . But that 's not the kind of musician he is . He 's going to experiment and grow and always mature as an artist , and nothing pisses off music fans like their favorite bands doing new things . I mean , just look at Metallica.The followup to `` Spiral '' was `` The Fragile '' , which was a boring , laborious double album that really should n't have been . It had a few good songs , such as the title track , but for the most part it was self-indulgent , repetitive , and just plain dull . After that came `` With Teeth '' , which was short , catchy , and for the most part , radio-friendly . I have no problem with that album , but it was bit lame for Nine Inch Nails . It seemed that good old Trent has had problems coming up with a record to even compare to his masterpiece.The new album `` Year Zero '' is not that album either , but for the record , it is better than both `` Fragile '' and `` Teeth '' . What really amazed me was that he made a new album so fast . There was a five year wait between Spiral and Fragile , and then a six year wait until Teeth , which only came out two years ago . Maybe he should focus on making albums faster in the future . `` Year Zero '' is definitely NIN 's best album since `` Spiral '' . It is more biting and relevant than `` Teeth '' , and much more focused and straightforward than the rambling `` Fragile '' . It has more of a techno sound that is reminiscent of `` Spiral '' , and is not as deliberately radio friendly as `` Teeth '' . I 'm sorry to define the album by comparing it to the others , but I think that 's the most efficient way.There are several great songs , such as `` Survivalism '' and my personal favorite , `` Capital G. '' Making fun of the Bush Administration is pretty easy these days , but the song is still good . The album is actually a sort of concept album , imagining what our lives might be like in the future . The environment , politics , war , religion , and the media are all put on display . And none of them get away without some serious criticism . Perhaps this focus is what makes the album so good . Each song has something very important to say . Some of the lyrics are absolutely brilliant.From `` Capital G '' : `` I pushed a button and elected him to office / and he pushed a button and it dropped the bomb . '' Also , `` Do n't try and tell me how some power can corrupt a person / You have n't had enough to know what it 's like . '' The song is basically a slam against Bush and the general Republican mindset.From `` The Warning , '' from the point of view of an alien race : `` We have come to intervene / You will change your ways and you will make amends / Or we will wipe this place clean . `` From `` God Given '' : `` I sure would n't want to be praying to the wrong piece of wood . '' Obviously , this song is against religious fundamentalists.One similarity this album does share with `` Teeth '' is the sing-songy nature of the lyrics . Many of the choruses have a very catchy rhythym , which I do n't mind if they 're saying something interesting . But the music is more complex and more inspired in general.Like I said before , Trent Reznor is never going to top `` The Downward Spiral '' . But even with that in mind , `` Year Zero '' is his best album since then and totally worth buying . Actually , it 's worth buying just for the USBM Warning on the back . That was just awesome .	1
I just listened to this on my ITunes today , and I played it in complete sequence , one track after the other . I believe this is the way this particular album deserves to be listened to . Let it be known , this is , to me , Nine Inch Nails best CD to date - even besting the debut `` Pretty Hate Machine '' , which remained one of my favorite rock albums for years before Fiona Apple released `` When the Pawn '' ( which is a rock album , nuff said ) .Like Tori Amos ' `` Scarlets ' Walk '' , this CD zones in one place and time and makes you think about action , consequence , and solution . I found this riveting . Even though you may not find anything in common between this CD and Tori 's ` Walk ' , the similarities screamed out to me upon first listen . Musically , they are varied , but the mind its coming from is in the same place , I think.What I especially liked is the questioning of fascism , socialism , oppression , democracy and the concept of extinction , all on one record ( read the lyrics - its all there ) . What concept Trent originally had for this is questionable , but its an amalgamation of all things . In a nutshell , it asks you whether the year 2022 is the year you think it will be , based on what the world is going through right now . Once you answer that , it asks you what you 'd like to do to achieve the utopia that the year could be . However , I also got the distinct impression that Trent has decided that Year Zero is definitely going to be an End Year , where Armageddon finally comes and blows us out of the water.Each listener will no doubt get different things from this album . Any album that can do that in my opinion , is great . I 'd suggest listening to this CD and Tori 's aforementioned album side by side , or one after another . A surreal experience to be sure , and one you should definitely repeat ! Four Stars . An instant masterpiece no doubt , but Trent could have done much better outlining his concept . On the plus side , it can be anything you want it to be , so theres a gift .	1
I havent even listened to NiN before and after listening to this cd , I 'm hooked . The lyrics are extremely deep and meaningful , and if you are or not a NiN fan , pick this cd up , you will love it . I have listened to all of this cd on repeat for 4 days and I cant get enough of it . After reading a little about Trent Reznor and comparing this cd to his others , this is definitely his best at the moment.Pick this up , you wont regret it .	1
Although I had n't followed the extremely elaborate and horrifyingly creative marketing behind this album , when I heard that Trent was going to put out a new album in such a short amount of time after the release of `` With Teeth '' ( well , short by NIN standards ) , I immediately got excited . I 've been a huge fan of Nine Inch Nails for a long time and Reznor had never disappointed me . Even though I did n't think `` With Teeth '' was his best effort , I had a feeling it was leading up to something even bigger than the fans and even Reznor could have ever imagined . And that is this supreme entity that is `` Year Zero . '' I can not tell you how many times I 've listened to this entire album , as I have lost count . Trust me , I 'm sure it 's in the hundreds somewhere . `` Year Zero '' being a conceptual album tells the story of a very bleak and ultimately hopeless America in the future where power and greed has overtaken the country , the government is in control of everyone and everything , and not only that , a sort of `` presence '' from another world , another universe has given us a stern warning to change our ways or face our terrible annihilation . While the album does tell a story , gives us different perspectives and such , it still works as a full length album that 's enjoyable to listen to all the way through even if you do n't pick up on all of that from the start.It 's really hard to put in words what an impression this album has left on me , but I 'll do my best . After hearing this album , it now becomes clear and it seems like all the other past albums were leading up to this moment . I think Trent knew all along he would make this album , it was just a question of time . The music and the lyrics are hypnotically stunning and Reznor 's still got it as far as vocals are concerned . There are verses and choruses that will stay with you and refuse to get out of your head , especially the last haunting chorus in `` zero-sum . `` This is really an album that you want to listen to all the way through every single time . Sure , there are songs that are my favorites , but the experience comes from listening to the entire thing . It 's rare when I want to do that , and also listen to it in the exact order that it 's presented . My favorites are `` the beginning of the end , '' `` survivalism , '' `` the good soldier , '' `` capital g , '' `` the warning , '' `` in this twilight , '' and `` zero-sum . '' Again , I love the entire album , but those are my favorites.Just keep this in mind , if you 're expecting another `` Downward Spiral , '' you will be disappointed . Know why ? Because `` Year Zero '' sounds like `` Year Zero . '' It 's a different entity from the other past efforts . Also , this is one that requires multiple listens as you 'll pick up something new each time . So , make sure you listen to it a bunch of times all the way through before you make your decision . It 's not meant to be an instant hit , although it was for me . Instant hits get forgotten quickly . `` Year Zero '' will go down as one of those classic albums that everybody talks about , and I truly believe in that . Mellow , loud , noisy , quiet and shockingly deep , Reznor has put out a superb masterpiece , and after many listens I can safely say that `` Year Zero '' is by far my favorite Nine Inch Nails album . -Michael Crane	1
this has to be some of his best work . it 's different and that 's a good thing . .	1
The absolute best NIN album since Downward Spiral . Verry creative , verry industrial , ... I love it !	1
I had caught the album in between and With Teeth but missed this one . year zero has all of the sound and acoustics you would expect from yet another NIN classic .	1
I love year zero.I listen to minimalistic electronica a lot.this album is right up my alley.the fragile would be my choice however , if I had to pick one.the fragile is underrated in the mainstream press andyear zero forgotten.it 's sad.Trent failed following up fragile ( with teeth sucks ) and I think you only get so much attention unless you 're more mainstream.get this album if you like techno.get the fragile if u like music .	1
While I miss the older , _HEAVIER_ NIN . This album really is n't too bad . Some music is very `` watery '' to me , like Linkin Park . That 's how I 'd describe `` With Teeth '' but this is a definate step up . The lyrics on `` Year Zero '' scream `` anti-Fundamentalism , anti-Right Wing , anti-Moral Majority . '' The vid for Survivalism has a military `` Task Force '' busting into the bedroom of a Homosexual couple and presumably killing them and dragging them away ... pretty disturbing ! Could that possibly be our America in the future ? The song `` Capital G '' makes me wonder if Trent is talking about [ G ] od or [ G ] eorge W. Bush . Both are pretty big jerks . In a time when `` EMO '' dominates the airwaves , video channels , and Hot Topic ( which USED TO BE a cool store ) Trent dares to stand out from the sheep . Though `` Year Zero '' is good , it is n't GREAT . It does n't hit nearly as hard as some of the OLDER albums , and `` Heresy '' will never be replaced AS my personal `` F*** FUNDIES '' anthem ... `` He made a virus , that would kill off all the swine ! `` ( PS : I wish Trent and DIR EN GREY would team up , they could do some amazing stuff together )	1
After the more mainstream and radio friendly With Teeth from 2005 , it seemed like Trent Reznor was going through what seemed to be a mid-life crises . But now it seems that it was just him trying to figure out if he could still make music . That fact being proven , Trent now decided to take his work a little more seriously . The culmination of this ( and numerous recording sessions during breaks in between shows during the 2005-06 With Teeth tour ) is Year Zero.Year Zero ( YZ ) features 16 tracks , making it the second longest Nine INch Nails ( NIN ) album next to 1999 's `` The Fragile '' . The sound of YZ is much more in line with NIN 's industrial roots , but even more so , it draws on the sounds of electro clash , drum and bass and minimalist techno . In other places it features classical piano . Yet in the end , YZ has the unmistakable sound of Trent Reznor 's work.YZ is also a concept album , with an interesting science fiction/political storyline going on throughout it . There is also an `` Alternative Reality Game '' going on to promote the album , which in itself helps bolster the otherwise boring and hackneyed `` packaging '' that the album would normally have had if it were any other CD . To engage in this so called ARG , one should seek out the official Nine Inch Nails website or `` The NIN WIKI '' .The choice picks from this album would be the following : -The `` My Sharona '' drum pattern using `` The Beginning of the End '' , which might have a cliche title ( and drum beat ) , but its sound is as refreshing and invigorating as a blast of adrenaline mixed with licking an electric socket when it seems like the fight has just turned against you.-The haunting and beautiful `` The Good Soldier '' , which has some very thought provoking lyrics and rhyming built into it . The best part comes at the end when it transforms from a stripped down bass driven industrial track to a `` Fragile '' -esque piano laden track with a mixture of electronic goodness.-Sleeze and power tripping ( something NIN is known best for ) sets in on the track `` Vessel '' . This track in particular features a mess of thundering choruses and a break down section of chaotic and erratic industrial and minimalist techno noises . Some electro house is thrown in as well for good measure . If anything , this is definitely one of the tracks that Reznor said : `` You could f*** to.. '' -The political ( and ALMOST ) ambiguous `` Capital G '' , which features some clever humor and loud , grinding guitar moments . Rather than trying to describe this track , it should just be heard ! You will most likely hear it since it has been chosen [ Edit : as of the time this review was written ] to be the second single off of the album.-And the thundering , overpowering `` Meet Your Master '' , which rings in memories of NIN 's `` Broken '' , along with some more beautiful , loud electronic chaos . This track has it all : A strong chorus , Trent 's signature creepy thoughts , catchy hooks and a layering of distortion guitars and noisy synthesizers.In actuality , this album really does not have any dull moments . There is enough change up and diversity that keeps the album from ever growing stale . The only concern I have is that with such a climatic and `` apocalyptic '' end track on the album , how will there be a sequil to this concept album* ? Perhaps we 'll find out more as the storyline for Year Zero progresses ... As you can judge from the star rating , this reviewer was ONE happy customer with the purchase of YZ . It is a delight to see that NIN is still capable of making fresh music that is both good and thought provoking . I HIGHLY recommend picking up YZ , as well as also at least giving the accompanying ARG that the album has going on with it .	1
I love Buckethead 's music ! He is one of the most technically proficient guitar players out there . And with that said , some of his musical ideas are truly out there as well . So as with a lot of his cds , ( and he has a lot ! ) , you often have several awesome rock and mellower songs . And that is usually mixed with some very experimental musical ideas , some good , some , well you decide . I love his music , even the weird stuff , but that 's because I play guitar as well and can relate.I gave this CD four stars only because some of the tracks are very experimental and most people would really not care for them , but the rest of the songs make up for the misses.Wish I could find a CD version , but they go on e-bay for hundreds of dollars , ( quite rare )	1
Sister Sledge 's `` He 's the Greatest Dancer '' is one of those songs that symbolizes disco at it 's very best . It was written by Chic 's N. Rogers and B. Edwards when these guys were at the top of their game.When I heard that it was being remade by Dannii Minogue , I was somewhat skeptical as so many disco songs have been butchered when they have been remade as they do n't manage to capture the greatness of the original nor manage to add anything new to make it work.This maxi-single has a generous 8 mixes , which starts with the LMC mix , a very faithful to the original song : A juicy , pulsating celebration of a female who is attracted to a man due to his dancing and a quite a lot more ; - ) From the 3rd to the 8th selection , the release shoots to make the song more contemporary for the most part it works quite well . There is some inclusion of house on the Chris Lake Remix that is quite fun.The Shapeshifters Remix starts off quite well with a nice tease . Riffs & Rays Mix has house elements then switches into electronica and is probably the version that varies most from the original as the voice is secondary to the beat . It 's my current favorite after the LMC Edit . The Fugitive Club Mix is just OK.All in all I am very impressed that Dannii has done such a great job with this song . Her vocals are not the greatest on earth compared to the original , but it it does not take away from the enjoyment of having this song updated for a a new generation of dancefloor maniacs , if only a living room dancefloor . Enjoy !	1
I must admit that aussies are on of the best at remixing their music and this single is an exemplo of that , so if you like the song and you do n't mind have bunch of remixes of the same single then get it .	1
I love anything that she does and she never fails to entertain ! Buy this Cd and enjoy all the music that Miranda Lambert makes !	1
Famous In a Small Town , Dry Town , More Like Her , Easy From Now On , Gunpowder and Lead , becoming a great songwrighter and a great interpreter of others . Vocals and songwrighting gets better with every CD . Leaving Gretchen W. and Taylor S. in the dust with this one . And she is an entertainer too .	1
I just love her music all around . One of my favorite album so far . And so convenient- downloads to itunes .	1
Of all the female country artists out there Miranda Lambert is the most under-rated of all of them and it 's a cryin ' shame because she blows everyone out of the water . While people like Carrie Underwood have sold millions of albums and have good to excellent voices Miranda has the whole package . Miranda not only has one of the best voices in country music she also possesses song writing skills that I have n't seen in years and her live shows are the most energetic and captivating I have ever seen . I would say Miranda 's live shows are the best of any live act in any genre.Crazy Ex-Girlfriend , the followup to her debut album Kerosene is a rockin ' country album . From the rocking sound of the lead off track Gunpowder and Lead , a song that will sure make a guy think twice of messing with Miranda or else you might be at the wrong end of a shotgun to the soon to be classic Crazy Ex-Girlfriend , where she goes after her ex 's new girlfriend to the country radio friendly Famous in a Small Town which chronicles growing up in a small town this album will have something for everyone.Every song on this album is incredibly well written and enjoyable . While other artist have rose to the top overnight Ran will earn her fame the hard way , which in the long run will lead to a long , steady climb to the top where with the loyal fan base she will build will keep her on top for years to come.I would have given this album a 10 of 10 if I could have . A song by song review would be pointless because every song would be given a 10 star rating . So I will just say order this album yourself and find out why she has so many positive reviews !	1
Her attitude really shows in this cd . Even though I never heard lots of the songs on this cd , it is fun to listen to .	1
This is an awesome cd , ca n't beat Miranda ! ! We have not stopped listening to this one yet ... 6 weeks ? Kids love it too .	1
This women has a wonderful voice and she is also beautiful . Where do these girls come from ? ? ? I loved the Album and will buy anymore she makes .	1
Listen to the first two tracks on this cd to hear how diverse Miranda can be.Gunpowder and Lead is leather and electric and the very next track Dry Town is blue jeans and root beer . I love it.There are n't any throwaways on this cd.Desperation , a Miranda composition is a fine story song.Same with Famous In A Small Town , a Miranda/Travis Howard song.The whole cd has a great cohesive feel to it . Though the songs are allvery different in beat and intensity . Great lyrics throughout.For the life of me I can not understand why Miranda is noteverywhere on country radio and why she is n't winning the awards.She writes her own stuff , she is a musician , she has a very unique vocal style in today 's country , and she is naturally gorgeous.Do n't depend on the limited view of country radio play , get this cd for yourself.You will be doing yourself a great favor .	1
I am always amazed at the voice that comes out of this little girl . I could listen to her all day . Love that her music does not all sound the same .	1
Let it be said that Miranda Lambert is the best artist to emerge from a 'reality show ' on any station in any musical format . That this `` Nashville Star '' graduate had a great voice is a moot point , but few could have predicted that she would make a timeless , classic album such as `` Crazy Ex-Girlfriend '' so early in her career.The album title is unfortunate ( I would have preferred that she chose something more laidback or meaningful ) , but the album is most decidedly a grassroot country album that gives you true country in this era of pathetic pop-rock being passed off as country . One listen to this album and you will not be able to take Carrie Underwood or Taylor Swift seriously anymore . The 'country music ' that they make is fake , at best , but granted they know how to churn out good tunes.Miranda targets a different audience - one that knows its ' music , and one that respects the great tradition of country music . Its an art that few have appreciated , and a genre that very few have been able to truly embrace . I can safely say that Dolly Parton is the only female country artist who 'knew ' what country was all about , in my opinion , as she was the best storyteller of them all . `` Crazy Ex-Girlfriend '' is a concept album about a relationship that dies . Every track tells a story that neatly segues into the next song and message . While Miranda is great with some killer tunes , her voice is the most appealing instrument here - her pitch and vocal control is simply amazing , and she has by FAR the most unique voice in country music right now - you ca n't confuse her with anyone else . And what a superb Southern accent ! Magnetic , is what I call her.Highlights for me are `` Down '' ( according to me the best track on the album , though it has n't been released as a single ) , and `` Desperation '' ( which sets the tone for the depressing subject matter the album contends with ) . The music here is vintage country and bluegrass , with rock elements rearing their head every now and then . Miranda is conscious of 'good tunes ' and its evident they tacked on a few great melodies here , but it all just works . The title track for instance , with its rural-vocal opening and slowburn start , is a perfect introduction to one killer of an album.An album or `` LP '' as it was once known , is a long player that needs to have a cohesive message . In this age of one or two hit singles and an album full of filler , its a rare treat that Miranda Lambert has taken time out to craft an album where every song tells a story , where every song has a discernible melody and personality of its ' own . To me , this country album epitomizes the very best of what the genre has to offer , and is easily one of the greatest country albums of all time.Introduce yourself to Miranda 's music , and you might just learn to appreciate what REAL country music is all about . In fact , if you listen to this album and then listen to Shania Twain , you 'll realize the vast difference . Lambert is bringing country back , and has single-handedly given back respect and dignity to a genre that has been overtaken by corporate muppets.Five Stars . An Epic Album that will go down in history as one of country musics ' best of all time .	1
This is a great cd , a beautiful young lady , whom has a lot of talent , I would order it again if I had too ! Thank you amazon !	1
I generally do n't like country music : either too much flag waving or too much flag trashing , weepy ballads , mournful lyrics . But every once in a while there is a new take , something different , a fresh look . So it is with this album which cuts to the quick with the opening song about a battered woman taking the law into her own hands . Or the title track , Crazy Ex-Girfriend , where a dumped woman goes a stalking . Her songs are direct , without artifice or trying to sound a certain way . She has her own voice and it is a welcome one .	1
Miranda is special . A real country girl , a hot female country singer with the down-home vocals that the music is all about . Miranda 's hero 's are the likes of Merle Haggard and she writes and performs songs that would make a real country enthusiast proud . This album contains a collection of some of the best country music for decades .	1
I love Miranda Lambert and this CD is just Miranda heart and soul . Sassy , witty , funny . When I 'm in traffic that is really intense Miranda and Johnny Cash are my go-to CD 's , and this particular CD is one of her best . If you like Miranda Lambert this is as good as it gets .	1
This is one of the best albums , it just makes me feel good and want to move when I listen to it ,	1
Miranda Lambert 's `` Crazy Ex-Girlfriend '' is an exceptional sophomore release and refreshing change from much of the county music that is on the radio today . Most of the album has the same feel as her debut album , Keroseneand Lambert 's vocal range can be described as a female Hank Williams Sr. mixed with some Loretta Lynn . Lambert 's voice is very raw and has a feel of `` old country , '' rather than the typical over-produced and mixed recordings of most of the female country artists today . As I had to do with `` Kerosene , '' I listened to this album many times before I could appreciate all of the songs on it . And literally every song is good.One of the reasons this album is so exceptional , is that Lambert wrote or co-wrote 8 of the 11 songs , and the only thing she does better than singing is songwriting . Perhaps this understanding of the songs is the reason that her singing comes across with so much conviction.1 . Gunpowder and Lead , 4 . Crazy Ex-Girlfriend - fast-paced , and the only two songs that deviate slightly from Lambert 's `` old-country '' feel and sound more contemporary . `` Crazy Ex-Girlfriend '' could almost be called a sequel to `` Kerosene . '' These will likely be the only radio-friendly singles . Given the chorus , they could just as easily have been sung by Gretchen Wilson , however a closer look at the lyrics show that despite the tempo of the music , these songs have a much more serious nature at second glance.2 . Dry Town , 3 . Famous in a Small Town - A closer look at Lambert 's life growing up in Longview , Texas.5 . Love Letters , 6 . Desperation , 7 . More Like Her - These are the only three songs written entirely by Lambert , and lyrically , are the best songs on the album . The tone in all three is pretty different , but they all have the quality of exceptional writing , that somehow the producers were able to put to fairly good music . `` Love Letters '' is a true country ballad , yet retains a modern feel.8 . Down , 9 . Guilty in Here - Somewhat forgettable songs , but they grow on you and are still fairly good.10 . Getting Ready , 11 . Easy From Now On - Lambert did not co-write either of these songs , which is unfortunate since they are two of the best on the album . `` Easy From Now On '' is probably my favorite musical track , and I enjoy her version even more than the one originally sung by EmmyLou Harris.Ultimately , `` Crazy Ex-Girlfriend '' is a follow up well-worthy of Lambert and showcases some exceptional songwriting and vocal talent . This is not traditional country music filled with ridiculously cheesy lyrics and the same chorus every 30 seconds , but introspective writing and an excellent followup from this rising young artist .	1
This is my all time favorite album . I love Miranda 's music and every song on this album is worth it . There are songs for everyone to relate to . Great buy well worth it .	1
I think this is the best album I have had for awhile . The songs flow and continue , the vocals do not get tiresome , and the the overall tempo of the album is consistent . Heavy riffed bellowing .	1
This is classic Six Feet Under , and is better than their last release and there are no stupid covers on this one !	1
Moonsorrow 's _VIIDES LUKU - H & Auml ; VITETTY_ ( _Chapter V : Ravaged_ ) is so huge it makes the bands previous epic standards seem puny by comparison . And I have to say , as great as Moonsorrow 's grandiose Viking metal has been up to this point , especially the last one _VERIS & Auml ; KEET_ , this blows it away ! How do they keep doing this stuff ? ? ? ? Here , instead of a half-dozen epic songs like previous albums , _H & Auml ; VITETTY_ is just two-massive half-hour tracks where all of Moonsorrow 's supreme strengths are on display : crushing metal sound , tuneful metal arrangements with diverse instrumentation , borrowed folk melodies , drumming that is more `` percussionist '' than `` metal drummer '' , powerful choral chanting and screams for vox , and absolute Epicness whose footprint covers all kinds of evocative landscapes . The five-piece metal core of the band is accompanied by lots of acoustic guitars , synths , mouth harp , and accordion , and choral ensemble . Blastbeats are dominant only in one passage in per track , as Moonsorrow uses them with blasting riffs as peaks of violent emotional intensity . Much of the music is otherwise mid-tempo , with slower and quieter passages throughout . When these build-and-release patterns are masterfully spread out over half-hour epics and capped off with flattening endings , you get what is really one of the best metal albums of recent years , and ever . You must pick it up.The first track , `` Born of Ice/Stream of Shadows '' begins with several minutes of lugubrious chanting , crystalline electric guitar arpeggios , and rippling bass sounds that sound like a campfire . There is no metal until about six and a half minutes in , it spends its earlier moments building tension . Then after a slow quake of distorted , ascending scales , a mid-tempo chug with beautiful tremolo riffing and Sorvali screams of `` one note of the still landscape carrie [ d ] afar on the quiet lake '' . The middle passages that follow , from melodic folk melodies arranged for aggressive metal and breathtaking blastbeasts played to unabashed major key guitars , not to mention a wonderful part with grumbling set of low-octave keys on piano , vamping with crunching riffs ... all show absolutely perfect songcraft . There is a wonderful acoustic passage about 16-minutes in where an accordion lead accompanies strummed chords and rolling triplet beat . Everywhere the band shows incredible imagination and , I dunno what the word is ... MASTERFUL TASTE , maybe . Words are somewhat inadequate . The finale is uplifting with huge backdrop of orchestral sounding synths and voices , and the requisite chimes for extra effect . As it fades , the initial chord from the beginning is played once with those fiery sounding rumbles in the background , then it goes into the chanting-and-percussion jam that opens the next song.Impossibly it would seem , `` A Land Driven Into the Fire '' is even better than the first track . After the first part , there is a haunting minor-key passage for strummed acoustic guitar , mouth harp , accordion , and timpani . As it progresses , a ghostly wisp of electric guitar foreshadows the slow yet pitilessly heavy riff that eventually appears . The minor key passage is worked in again with more distorted conditions . The electric-acoustic mix is maintained beautifully for some time ... until essentially broken by the tsunami of the so-called Valhalla choir that appears in full-force , sounding very high in the mix and singing awesomely `` splinter your axes against the rocks ... shed your skin to reveal your flesh '' . there is a long build-up , and as with track 1 this piece covers huge territory , including another accordion-m.harp-acoustic guitar jam , and the breathtaking assault of razer-sharp black metal with hellfire drums & guitars at the 13-minute point , and parts like _bergtatt_-era Garm leading a militaristic army of Vikings on electric guitars inspired by black metal , folk , and prog rock . It is all absolutely spectacular , but the ending really pushes it over the edge . It is one of the greatest finales I 've ever heard in music , I get chills thinking about it ! Probably from about 20:00 to the final seconds with its quiet sounds ... amazing . It takes you off guard at one point by fading out to almost nothing , when you think `` that 's it , now there 'll probably be a long outro of nice little nature samples ... '' and it already would have been an awesome finale ... but then it kicks in again and it 's more awesome and triumphant even than before . CLASSIC.Every great band naturally comes to a peak , usually somewhere in the middle of their career . To inconsequentially speculate , _Chapter V_ is so amazing this could be Moonsorrow 's peak , and as such it is easily one of the best albums in its field . If the band can ever surpass this , I probably wo n't be able to handle it . The band is just so good they must be using sorcery ! You can put this music equally with the best of black metal/Viking metal , but also the best of progressive metal epics , as they share symphonic structures and diverse elements .	1
This is my first exposure to Moonsorrow 's music and I 'm very impressed . The whole album is two songs that clock in around 30 minutes a piece ( 30:10 and 26:20 if we 're sticklers for detail ) . This is n't like a bunch of small songs that were stitched loosely together . Each track really feels like a progression of sweeping movements that could n't be cut up into smaller chunks . These guys know how to build up tension and energy and then deliver the goods at the right moments . There is a lot of atmosphere here as well , which is helped along by the folk elements such as chanting and mouth harp ( I know , right ) . If you like melodic death metal , black metal , folk metal ... pretty much anything to come out of Finland ( or Scandinavia in general ) , you should check this out .	1
The band Noisettes represents another case where I see an artist in a list of my albums to listen to but I do n't remember where I heard of them . At any rate , their full-length debut album What 's the Time , Mr. Wolf is pretty solid.You normally would n't expect a black woman to be fronting a rock band , especially since it does n't always work right ( Wicked Wisdom , anyone ? ) . But frontwoman Shingai Shoniwa does a great job leading the rest of the band through these songs . One reviewer described the band as Billie Holiday fronting the White Stripes , and although I do n't know if I would necessarily say THAT , I can say that there are plenty of rockin ' tunes like `` Can not Even ( Break Free ) '' , `` Do n't Give Up '' and `` Scratch Your Name '' . Mellow songs also work , as shown by `` Hierarchy '' and the hidden track , `` Never Fall in Love Again '' .I did n't really care for `` IWE '' , and `` Nothing to Dread '' made me say the opposite ( well , the chorus , anyway ) . But What 's the Time Mr. Wolf still proves that Noisettes are one of the most interesting bands out there right now , so check it out.Anthony Rupert	1
This cd brought me through a tough situation . I let my sis use my car one day and when I got in the car , my mind was so heavy and the song `` This One '' was playing . I began to listen to the words . It began to minister to my spirit . It says that `` I 'm not going to lose my mind , I 'll get through this one ... ... I have been here before . '' That was my confirmation that I am going to make it no matter what the situation is . I just have to trust and believe that My God is Who He Says He Is . So thank you sis for leaving this in the car , it has truly blessed me ! ! ! !	1
This is a very good addition to my Torn library of cds . This is very typical of Torn 's music to mix 'n mash very different music genres in each composition . My only complaint is there could have been more emphasis on the individual playing of the other band members .	1
I do n't understand all the negative sentiment surrounding this release . This disc blew me away the first time I heard it . It has not left the CD player yet . There is so much beautiful music contained here . Everyone involved sounds great and you can sense that Berne and Torn are on the verge of sharing a common langauge .	1
If you like the Eagles , or if you like the mixing of country music with rock 'n ' roll , you 'll enjoy knowing where it all came from . The Burritos ' music is not polished and they never had a hit , but their music started a lot of other bands doing the same thing -- like the Eagles , New Riders of the Purple Sage , Jackson Browne , and many others .	1
Although called 'The Definitive Collection ' , this is in fact a reissue of the Burritos ' first two albums - the massively influential `` The Gilded Palace Of Sin '' and `` Burrito Deluxe '' , plus one or two other little known gems such as the single `` Train Song '' and the classics `` Six Days On The Road '' and `` Close Up The Honky Tonks '' . No material later than `` Burrito Deluxe '' ( 1970 ) is included here.In 1968 , following on from the ground breaking `` Sweetheart Of The Rodeo '' ( critically acclaimed but commercially toxic ) , ex-Byrds Chris Hillman and Gram Parsons decided to continue following their dream of playing Country and Western sentiment ( white man 's blues ) within the framework of Rock - very risky given the background of the late 60 's counterculture ( think last reel of `` Easy Rider '' and all that ) . Their dream became `` The Gilded Palace Of Sin '' . It 's hard to know where to start when reviewing `` The Gilded Palace '' . Many thousands ( millions probably ) of words have been written in praise of this album . To me it 's an album which can be played ad infinitum - the last word in real country-rock ( not the saccharine Eaglesque fare we 've been subjected to since the early 70 's ) . Some songs have an almost Gospel feel about them , when the organ sound comes swirling through the mix . This is an album to be treasured . Moving on , `` Burrito Deluxe '' ca n't really compare with the first album - which still leaves it head and shoulders above about 90 % of everything else in the genre . The Burritos ' take on Dylan 's `` If You Got ta Go , Go Now '' has a punk-rock feel which pre-dates punk-rock by a good seven years . Their version of Jagger/Richards `` Wild Horses '' beats the Stones later version into a cocked-hat and then some . This is a great opportunity to buy the two best albums the Burritos ever made at a very nice price .	1
I have loved these guys since day one , so any CD is worthwhile . This contains most of their best songs and is well worth the price . If you like Gram and the boys , but do n't have any of their music , then buy this NOW !	1
-Excellent collection here- but I 'd suggest The Howlin ' Wolf Chess Box collection instead or the `` Howlin ' Wolf/Moanin ' in the Moonlight '' two album combo CD . Mind as well go on and get that . I wish I would have , because now I 'm going to fork out money for The Chess Box after buying the Definitive Collection . But ya can not go wrong with this musician .	1
This is really just MCA/Chess ' Howlin ' Wolf-compilation `` His Best '' in new guise , but that 's not a bad thing . `` His Best '' was by far the greatest single-disc Wolf-compilation on the market , and now this one is simply taking its place.But do you know what you are getting into here ? Even people who like Muddy Waters are sometimes turned off by the `` sound of heavy machinery operating on a gravel road '' that was Howlin ' Wolf 's voice.Chester Arthur Burnett , the Howlin ' Wolf , stood about 6'4 '' and weighed close to three hundred pounds in his prime , and his raw , throat-shredding vocals sound positively frightening on early cuts like `` Moanin ' At Midnight '' and the clanging , piano-driven boogie of `` How Many More Years '' , his first R & B ; hit , and the one which allowed him to proudly state that `` I 'm the onliest one drove out of the South like a gentleman ! `` This is electric blues of the highest order , rough and tough and extraordinarily powerful . The songwriting credits are shared about equally by the omnipresent Willie Dixon , who plays bass on most of these cuts , and the Wolf himself , and while few of these songs are as well-known as Muddy Waters ' `` Hoochie Coochie Man '' or Elmore James ' `` Dust My Broom '' , they are quite as magnificent.Wolf 's tough `` Who 's Been Talkin ' '' is an incredibly gritty tour de force set to a thumping rhumba beat , and Dixon 's horn-driven rave-up `` Hidden Charms '' features perhaps the greatest guitar solo ever comitted to tape , courtesy of Jimmy Page 's and Eric Clapton 's hero ( as stated by themselves ) , the extraordinary Hubert Sumlin.Other highlights include `` Forty-Four '' , the eerie `` Smokestack Lightnin ' '' , the slide guitar-driven `` Little Red Rooster '' and the phenomenal `` Killing Floor '' , written by Howlin ' Wolf , shamelessly stolen by Led Zeppelin and covered by several others , but never surpassed , and featured here in the ultimate version , propelled by an incredibly catchy guitar riff by Hubert Sumlin , and with Buddy Guy on acoustic rhythm guitar.Almost every song is a highlight , actually . This CD is a corner stone in any serious blues collection ... hard-rocking , bone-crunching electric blues , burning with the sheer ferocity of Chester Burnett 's incredible voice.There was never anyone quite like the Wolf , and it does n't seem likely that there will be .	1
Yes , absolutely the best collection of hits Howlin Wolf on the market . Although there are also double its compilation , this is definitely the best .	1
The last time I had occasion to mention the late Bo Diddley in this space was in connection with a series of interviews and performances along with Chuck Berry , Little Richard and others in Keith Richards Chuck Berry tribute film Hail , Hail Rock and Roll . The talk centered , rightly , on the dismal fate of many black recording artists who developed what would become Rock and Roll when the white artists like Elvis took it over and reaped the benefits of a mass audience . Well , those interviews occurred a while ago , back in the 1980 's , but Bo 's sense of not having been properly recognized I believe remained until his death . Yet , when one thinks of the sounds created by the founders of Rock and Roll can anyone deny that Bo 's primal beat was not central to that explosion ? I think not.Here , in one album we have , if not all of Bo 's creative work then a good part of it , at least a good place to start . Of course , the classic song Bo Diddley and its offshoots and variations are here . However , the one Diddley song that will probably outlive them all though is Who Do You Love . Although not a theme song it nevertheless expresses the raw energy of rhythm and blues/ rock/ carib sound like not other . Hell , George Throughgood was able to make a whole career on the basis of having covered that song and other Bo work ( and to be fair , covering the work of Elmore James and Hound Dog Taylor as well ) .And that is a good point to finish on . The really great rockers , and Bo is in that company , unlike the one-shot johnnies get covered because their work expresses something that someone else later wishes to high heaven that they had created . ( George has been quoted directly on that point . ) Finally , I give the same warning here as others have given in their comments about the sameness of this CD and the Chess 50th Anniversary CD from 1997 . Get one or the other and save those pennies to get more of Bo 's work . `` I said- I 'm just 22 and I do n't mind dying . Who do you love ? '' Thanks for that line Bo . Kudos	1
Wow , what a cd . High quality sound , great selection of hits and some songs that I heard for the first time . There were two songs that I did n't care for but the rest were super . Do n't be afraid to add this one to your collection .	1
Mayall and his Bluesbreakers band are awesome . If you like the blues , this is a welcome addition to any collection .	1
John Mayall has been around forever . Him and Eric Clapton and the Blues Breaker 's were and are the very foundation of Rock~n~Blue 's . Pick this one up and You will be wanting more . Thrust Me ... there is a lot More . NO REGRETS ! ! ! !	1
I have been a Paul Rodgers fan for years starting with Free , Bad Company , The Firm , The Law and now on his own . This cd is proof that Paul Rodgers voice is still as great as it ever was . This cd is a must for all you Paul Rodgers fans and I would recomend you checking out the Live in Glasgow concert on dvd it 's GREAT !	1
It is about time for this CD to be released and it is well worth the wait ! George Clinton is one of the most innovative producers in music history and it shows in this CD and what makes this CD so great is the music.For example `` Freaks Bearing Gifts '' is a song about kids being warned of peophiles but the track of `` Double Oh-Oh '' a song Clinton did in 1985 is played backwards ! Other songs worth mentioning is `` Sunshine of Your Love '' a great remake of a Eric Clapton/Cream song with some funk ingested into it . `` Some Fresh Delic '' is a go-go tribute to Washingon DC and Chuck Brown the godfather of go-go music.I also liked the radio edit of the CD title track better than the extended version.Overall this CD is n't the greatest Funkadelic track ever but compared what is given to us by the music industry it is worth buying	1
Six stars ! In 1975 the vinyl version of the album ( rare as hen 's teeth even then ) was my introduction to Nils Lofgren , and has remained one of my top ten albums of all time ever since.Odd tracks from this have filtered out on compilations , but finally we have the full show ( or at least the original radio broadcast - no bonus tracks , so I assume there was nothing else in the can ) . No matter . This is rock'n'roll perfection , the version of `` Like Rain '' here being arguably Nils ' finest recorded moment.Ca n't wait to get my hands on this .	1
Wonderful compilation of The Ikettes solo recordings - they are remembered as girls who danced and sang behind Ike & Tina Turner and usually opened their concerts . Because the main focus of concerts and discography was sensational Tina , girls somehow stayed in the background and although they had surprising hit with `` I 'm blue ( Gong song ) '' Ike kept them in check and never spotlighted them enough to give them proper success or to encourage them for bigger things.Because so many girls went in and out of The Ikettes , it 's almost impossible to keep track on who sang when - first line-up who wailed behind 1960. r & b ; smash `` A Fool In Love '' were soon replaced with anybody available at the moment ( even white , soulful Bonnie Delaney was Ikette herself once ) so girls came and go faster than anybody could remember.Their soulful voices were excellent , to be sure - Ike would n't have them otherwise - and there is funny anecdote about how Turners auditioned them , they noticed that girls were either stunning looking or great singers but almost never same simultaneously.So there was a beauty or two who would find their way into The Ikettes simply for being effective on stage ( like girl on the cover picture in centre who was famous non-singing Ikette ) but for recordings girls were always top class.If singing was first-rate , music unfortunately was not always inspired - Ike would rather die than to let anybody run his business and mostly it 's his own , very recognisable ( some would say generic ) simple sound , with music usually warmed up leftovers from other recordings ( `` The Biggest Players '' , '' Blue on Blue '' ) but even if it 's not earth-shaking or epochal , I absolutely love it as it sounds far more authentic than any Motown-crossover hit where singers shooted at the white audience.Talking about motown , Ikettes had their Motown-moment with `` Peaches and Cream '' which is actually not bad at all , but my favorites here are real bluesy growls of `` You 're trying to make me loose my mind '' ( with Tina clearly audible in the background ) or `` Your love is mine '' with almost gospel call-and-response.It is clear that The Ikettes misfortunes were rooted not in music but in other outside factors - girls even left to record under name of The Mirettes - but other Ikettes came right in their shoes and continued the tradition.They can be heard on Frank Zappa album `` Over-nite sensation '' as backing vocals ( together with Tina ) where Ike demanded they sould not be overpaid , in fact the album was recorded in his own Bolic studio and as he was the Boss , Zappa had to pay them peanuts because Boss said so , otherwise they might get big-headed.Interesting note : some of The Ikettes ( Venetta Fields ) later made a good living as backing singers and could be heard on many pop albums , including Barbra Streisand `` Stoney End '' and `` A Star is Born '' soundtrack .	1
`` Naughty , Bawdy & Blue '' is a delightful blues fest . Muldaur acts as musicologist in addition to performer . The booklet has bios for Ma Rainey , Victoria Spivey , Sippie Wallace , Bessie Smith , Mamie Smith , Ethel Waters , Alberta Hunter & Sara Martin . Muldaur 's duet with Bonnie Raitt on `` Separation Blues '' is a delightful showstopper with the band in full Dixieland mode , `` For years you dogged me round , but now 's the time for me to get you told what 's on my mind ; I 'm going away ; please do n't ask me to stay . '' `` New Orleans Hop Scop Blues '' is another Dixieland diamond with Muldaur 's voice sounding every bit like the CD title , `` New Orleans is a great big old Southern town where hospitality I have surely found , the population there is very very fair with everything they do . '' The CD concludes with a Ma Rainey tune that 's like a sunny day blues , `` Everytime I get a letter , it 's always bad news ; Everytime I see the mailman , yonder comes the blues . '' Other tracks like `` Handy Man , '' `` Smile , '' & `` One Hour Mama '' are also excellent . Muldaur 's blues bio is good reading . This set finds her knee deep in the blues . It 's riveting listening . Enjoy !	1
First , I have to admit a thing or two : I absolutely love Muldaur 's last two acoustic blues albums , second I frequently listen 1920s blues queens on my I-pod ( I collect with interest & enthusiasm their original music ) so naturaly I was very excited and curious about this album.It might be that I 'm too familiar with originals but I have impression that while Muldaur honestly loved & enjoyed previous two albums , this is done for the sake of finishing the trilogy.The magic is present only on duet with Bonnie Raitt who gracefuly harmonises from behind and dont push herself too much in front , excatly as young Muldaur did on her 1968 recording of the same song with great late Sippie Wallace.Althought Muldaur herself have talent , ability , attitude and formal connections with some of 1920s blues stars , somewehere at the back of my mind little voice tells me its still a little white girl trying to be big black mama - I do n't love Muldaur any less for it , since there 's nobody else who does this anyway , she 's clearly on a mission to keep the torch going on - but somehow it would make more sense to hear Etta James or Koko Taylor with this kind of material.For heart in the right place and her enthusiasm , four stars anyway .	1
`` Father , the sleeper has awakened . '' Indeed ! New from central Europe , Serenity has more than awakened . With excellent song writing , Serenity expertly walks the tight rope of sweet melodies while never requiring an insulin injection ( aka Styx ) . Oh , did I mention hard hitting riffage , thundering drums , and introspective moments among the mayhem ? I ca n't wait to see these guys at Prog Power USA in September .	1
I must just have bizarre tastes . While everyone else raves about Fake Empire , it still has n't grabbed me , yet one of my favorites is Guest Room , which nobody else has even mentioned . Anyway , this album is stellar . I was immediately taken by it , and you could be too , if the thought of an evening with nary a distortion pedal or emo scream sounds appealing . Deserves every bit of attention it is getting , and more.Mistaken for Strangers is not to be missed , nor Slow Show , nor Brainy , a tricky little gem which will lodge itself in your head for days .	1
The national took me a few listens to get into , but since I have , I feel amply rewarded . Their music is so true to life - so nice to have music that speaks to someone older than 13 . There is not a bad song on the album . Definitely one of the best modern acts . Its bands like this that have restored my faith in modern music .	1
This is the best album I 've heard in a while . I picked this one up upon the recommendation of a friend , having never heard anything of this band previously ; since then I 've been listening to Boxer straight though at least once every day . I simply can not get these songs out of my head -- especially `` Fake Empire '' and `` Mistaken for Strangers . '' There honestly is n't one throwaway track on this album . With Amazon 's low low price , you really have nothing to lose , so please , stop reading and buy this CD !	1
Honestly ... I think I like this record more than the first two ( and probably third ) Interpol albums . I also like it more than the National 's last record , `` Alligator '' , which was GREAT.This record is SOOOOOOOO much more than just some Joy Division rip-off . There is a boatload of Americana and folk influence to this record ... along with a biting critique of modern American urban life . Great songs about relationships and about our place in the world.I saw these guys play at the Duck Room in St Louis and they were incredible . I really hope this band blows up because of this record ... I listen to it as a whole so much that I can not even pick a favorite song !	1
Along with Canada'sThe Besnard LakesandStars , The National are by far above the rest of the musical spectrum this year . But not only have they outdone other bands : compared to their previous works , `` Boxer '' scores easily as their best album too.While their sound will remind you of numerous other groups ( Joy Division , Radiohead , The Cure , Interpol ) , Matt Berninger 's voice gives them a uniqueness that you will long for while the album is out of your reach .	1
The National-Boxer ****1/2Matt Berninger , Bryce Dessner , Aaron Dessner , Bryan and Scott Devendorf have been slowly perfecting their sound over their past few albums , and with Boxer , I truly feel The Nation have hit on what it is they were aiming to achieve . Complexity meets minimalistic vocals and instrumentation and lyrics to create a feel more than a sound , and an atmosphere may be a better term.Boxer is an album to get lost in , much like Miles Davis'Porgy and Bess . It is an album to free your mind and just let go with . The opening song 'Fake Empire ' is one of the most magnificent gems ever recorded . Both socially conscious and touching . 'Mistaken For Strangers ' is uniquely played . 'Squalor Victoria ' aside from having , what could be the perfect title , is easily the albums focal point . 'Slow Show ' brings the band into new territory , much different then all their previous work . 'Apartment Story ' is without comparison.What may be most surprising is that the most impressive and attention grabbing thing about the album is the drumming . It 's fresh , and original in a time of trite , and shopworn musicianship . It helps to push the entire album to that next level.The National 's Boxer is among some of the best music heard since the turn of the century . Highly recommended .	1
Just what rock music needs ... another over-hyped , next-big thing , saviors of rock and roll band . However The National has been around for a few years now , and may just be deserving of some hype.At least half of the songs are awesome , especially Fake Empire , Slow Show , Start A War and the amazing Ada . They still have that post-punk Cure/Psychedlic Furs/Joy Divison thing going on ; but instead of simply mimicking bands from that genre , they add their own signature.There is not as much variety in the music as on Alligator and a sense of sameness starts to pervade before the album ends . And the drumming , part of what made Alligator such a satisfying release , almost gets in the way here . But these are small quibbles . The National is a band to reckon with ! The National takes elements that on the surface would seem to be incongruous -- somber chamber music with almost breakneck speed percussion cobbled with the singers dour , impenetrable poetry . On paper it sounds like it would be a mess . On disc it is quite compelling .	1
The National ( originaly hailing from Cincinnati incidentally , before moving to New York in the late 90s ) have slowly but surely building their indie-music resume since their outstanding 2001 self-titled debut album . After their 3rd album , 2005 's `` Alligator '' , now comes the eagerly anticipated new album . `` Boxer '' ( 12 tracks , 43 min . ) shows the band progressing again with , at times , magical results . The first 4 tracks of the album are in my opinion the best the band has ever been . The opener `` Fake Empire '' starts off very calmy before slowing bursting into almost-epic sounds . `` Mistake for Strangers '' is a coulda/shoulda be hard-charging radio single , which reminds me of Joy Division , of all bands , as is `` Brainy '' , which is followed by my favorite track of the album `` Squalor Victoria '' , which features some lush orchestral instrumentation on top of the intense drums and piano , what a way to cap a perfect initial third of the album . After that , things level off a bit . `` Apartment Story '' is another hard-charged song that works great . Interesting to note that Sufjan Stevens plays piano on `` Racing Like a Pro '' and `` Ada '' . The closer `` Gospel '' is the perfect summary of the album : quiet , yet charged , it captures the mood.If mainstream radio would be a bit more open-minded , the National might break big . Given the sorry state of radio these days , I very much doubt it . But it does n't detract from the intrinsic beauty of `` Boxer '' as an album , and the National keeps winning more fans with each tour . I just love this slow-burner mood piece that this album is . Highly recommended !	1
The headline pretty much says it all . From the deep , self-doubting tones of Matt Berninger 's voice to the lovely musical arrangements , the musicians of The National sound their best on vinyl . For the longest time I was a digital only music fan . I have listened to this album countless times in mp3 format and I can tell you , it has never sounded as good or as moving as when I put it on my turntable . I 've even done and A/B comparison ( since my receiver has a USB input ) , playing the same tracks on mp3 and vinyl and the difference is clear . Bands like The National helped push me into getting my current stereo set up and so far the investment has been well worth it .	1
This was my favorite album of 2007 and made it to the top of my `` Best Albums of 2007 '' list ( [ ... ] ) I saw them in concert because I liked their album and their last one , Alligator , was amaaaaaazing . They are my favorite band of the moment and I just ca n't seem to get enough of them . Oh , and be sure to buy the B-sides to the singles from this album as they 're top-notch as well . `` Apartment Story '' off of Boxer is my favorite song of the year .	1
Listen to it once and get lost in the deep-voiced singing . Listen to it twice and hear how the rhythm tracks and guitar complement the vocals . Listen to it over and over until you realize that very few artists have this ability to make this kind of sleepy albeit propulsive music and know that you have another amazing album in your collection .	1
Always had Din Jr. on my radar ... has constantly come up as `` if you like this , you 'd like them ... '' however , material and samples I 've heard from them never did it for me . Until this album.Believe me , I have enough experience with music and the decline and reunion of bands to know that 99 times out of a hundred ... you should never start out ( as a first CD ) with a late release ... Granted , without really knowing the earlier material , I have to think that this album is an anomaly in that it could easily stand with their strongest earlier material ( this seems to be supported by earlier reviews as well ) .I 'm not really going to get into a song by song critique ... I just really like the layered guitar work , the catchy lyrics , JM 's vocals , the nice hooks , etc.The only ( complaint ) I have is the sonics/recording quality are absolutely horrible . I get the whole 'lo-fi ' movement , and can usually appreciate it . Often , with Indie music ... low-fi recording enhances the emotional impact . However , this recording is so bad , it makes old 8-tracks sound like hi-fidelity . I think my enjoyment of this album slightly suffers for it . Ca n't really fault the artist for that though ... can I ?	1
It 's a shame that this recording is only available in Starbucks , because it 's an instant classic.Most of the songs have stripped-down arrangements in contrast to the studio versions . All the classics sound great here , especially Artie 's vocals on `` Bridge . '' Paul and Artie also do a lot of album tracks like `` At the Zoo '' and `` Why Do n't You Write Me . `` The sound quality is excellent , and both S & G 's voices are in top form.If you like Simon & Garfunkel , this album is a must-have . It 's just too bad you can only get it in one place , and have to pay an arm and a leg for it . But it 's worth it .	1
Surprisingly this is 1st shop of any sound source by Paul and Artie even though I love their music for long years.The previous review let me try this work and beyond my expectation	1
First rate recording , they were at the top of their game . Garfunkel 's singing on Bridge over Troubled Water is breathtaking , heavenly . The only sour spot is the backup band , but even with that this recording is superb .	1
It still astounds me how much talent came out of American Idol : Season 5 and Paris Bennett is no exception to that statement . Do n't let her young age and petite body fool you , this girl can sing ! Paris has a HUGE voice that is showcased very well on her debut CD.The Good : I heard her first single : `` Ordinary Love '' and really liked the R & B ; /Rock fusion as well as her big ol ' voice . It also is a song that Paris co-wrote as well . Although it is the only song on this set that she co-wrote there are many good tracks included . There is a lot of versatility included on here : R & B ; , Hip/Hop , Pop and a few good ballads . A good theme in the majority of the songs on here is that they are all very melody driven which equals very catchy lyrics . She has a lot of conviction in her voice and you can hear that when she sings . It 's a powerful voice that ( in my opinion will take her far ) .Standout Tracks : '' Ordinary Love '' ( first single ) '' Dreamin ' '' '' Ca n't Control Myself '' '' I 'm So Hot '' ( could be a good club banger . makes you want to dance ) '' Get Bizzy '' '' Burnt Up '' '' Best Friends '' ( Ann Nesby is GREAT ! ! ! ) The Bad : The Interludes are so juvenile and quite annoying . I know she is 18 years old but , these are all giggly like something a 13 year old would do or say . WHY would anyone want to have Kevin Covais aka Chicken Little on their CD ? ! ? LOL He is on the song : `` Let Me Rap '' and he does JUST that . It 's horrid . He even refers to K-Fed in his `` rap '' . Another bad part was Paris doing a remake of `` My Boyfriends Back '' . Not good . Her vocals are decent but , it 's is done over a bassy , 69 boyz type beat - just does not sound good . That song did not even make the iPod.The good out weighs the bad here . There are great songs on here and is well worth the purchase especially if you watched her on AI . If you did not watch her then you would enjoy it just by being a fan of R & B ; /Hip-Hop jams . She has a great voice.~~~~~JAC 07 '	1
Melanie C has been one to watch since she emerged solo from the pop juggernaut that was the Spice Girls in 1999 with her debut breakout `` Northern Star . '' Since that time , much has happened , Melanie has grappled with her self-image , been dropped by her label , started her own , & become her own artist.Melanie often was dubbed `` Indie Spice '' or `` Rock Spice , '' terms that were slightly accurate were limiting , but it seemed she bought into them herself on her third album , 2005 's `` Beautiful Intentions . '' While a decent effort , `` Beautiful Intentions '' felt as though she was trying to prove something , her credibility , her strength , who knows ? It did n't resonate with everyone.On her second album on her own label , her fourth overall , `` This Time '' finds Melanie has embraced herself & it is reflected in this amazing set of songs.Opening on the Keane inspired `` Understand '' Melanie weaves an emotional tapestry of musical emotions , while still layering her songs in a fashion , so that they do n't run together . The title track is a soaring inspirational number , one that shows how Melanie became the vocal figurehead in the Spice Girls . `` What If I Stay '' is a hushed gem , that features an Alanis Morrisette inspired harmonica break , `` Carolyna '' is an uptempo rocker that is sure to charm any who hear it.Her duet with Adam Argyle ( writer of `` Next Best Superstar '' ) `` Do n't Let Me Go '' , is romantic and comes off as sincere rather than canned lovey dovey fluff . The first single from the record , her cover of the 1960 's cult pop cut `` I Want Candy '' by The Strangeloves , then made infamous in the 1980 's by Bow Wow Wow , is pure fun . Punchy ska-like horns and a sunny vocal delivery show that Melanie has learned to love her pop-oriented roots . `` This Time '' is a consistenly pleasing set of contemporary rock/pop songs , with your typical inspirational and love themed material . While not as schiphrenically appealing as her debut , it is n't as undercooked has her prior record was . Rather it combines the emotional lift that made `` Reason '' appealing and the moodiness of `` Beautiful Intentions , '' to give it that charismatic approach . Highly recommended .	1
The album title is very apt as the music exudes a sense of innocence and playfulness . Jones , at 88 , is nimble as ever , and Lovano responds by opening up his lyrical side . The interplay on these live performances is exquisite . Excellent selection of tunes . The piano and recording quality are superb . Definitely one for that desert island .	1
This is a sax-piano duet album , a challenging pairing . I 'm not familiar with Joe Lovano , but he plays very well . Hank Jones ( who must be approaching 80 ) is absolutely brilliant ( check out his accompaniment of Abbey Lincoln for more stunning work ) . The cd reminds me of another great sax-piano duet album by Bill Charlap and Houston Person -- also highly recommended .	1
A live performance of Molaskey and Pizzarelli is a fabulous experience . This can not create the same feeling , but the 2 are wonderful together . I too wished for more variety and stretch , but perhaps the next one will try harder .	1
i love this cd . it is a terrific mix of new and old . the songs are wonderfully reimagined . summer , highland falls is dynamite . sitting in limbo is wonderfully pensive and deep . i do n't get the unchartered territory business . this cd takes familiar songs to new places and quite cleverly . kudo , to mis . molaskey .	1
At first I found Amel 's singing a bit raw and serious for my taste but with a few listening you realise that she has a very nice selection and different arrangements to certain songs heard a hundred times.A fine voice ( ca n't wait for her next R & B ; album ) and you get a sense of pride listening to her as it feels like her heart is poured on to every track as she sings . Track number four is my favourite .	1
Is this band freakin ' amazing or what . They have got to be one of the best bands working today . I have never been disappointd by any of their albums . The only other band I can say that about is Enslaved . Is there the same musical composition ? The same brilliant musicianship ? The same incredible songwriting ability ? Does Steven Wilson have the most immaculate sense of melody ? The answer is a resounding yes to all . Gavin Harrisons drumming is phenominal and Richard Barbieri 's key work is ethereal throughout . Listen how Barbieri weaves his keys around and behind Wilson 's guitar playing . Brilliant ! ! So far , for 2007 the best song imo , is easily `` Anesthetize '' a massive and epic tune . I do n't know , but we all better enjoy this while we can , having PT at our listening disposal . In my experience bands of this ilk only come around once every 10-15 yrs . 20 yrs from now will determine how important this music will become . The only quibble is the lyrics and concept , not Wilson 's best . But the music , this is Godly stuff .	1
How can one REALLY put into words the deep feel of great music ... ... I have been listening to this 'Fear of a Blank Planet ' four ( 4 ) hoursand still ca n't click it off ... .it is without question one of themost creative buncha ' stuff imaginable . `` Way Out of Here '' gunna ' BLOWyour brain ! Dont miss this one .	1
FOABP is without a doubt one of the most significant albums to emerge from 2007 . Thematically this album centers on the fear that today 's youth are becoming out of touch , imbibing on an excess of tv , computers , prescription drugs , and instant gratification , opting to live a life of self centered ease instead of a life full of achievement and challenge . The music is brilliant and the lyrics haunting . My two favorites off this album are `` Ashes '' , which I think is an amazing piece of work , and `` Anesthetize '' , a 17+ minute opus featuring Alex Lifeson of Rush on lead guitar . Robert Fripp makes an appearance on `` Way Out of Here '' , providing some very King Crimsonesque 'soundscapes'.I will admit that it took several times listening through this album to begin to understand and appreciate it , but that time has been rewarded . Porcupine Tree 's music is deep , sometimes spacey , but relevant and interesting . Any prog rock fan needs to give this album a listen . Highly recommended .	1
Porcupine Tree is one of my three favorite bands in the world at the moment , so it pains me to say this ... I am a bit underwhelmed by `` Fear of a Blank Planet . '' If this were the first cd by the band I had heard , I would probably be overwhelmed by it , and gushing over it non-stop , but sadly , that is not the case.Still , this is a very enjoyable cd , which is no surprise , since it seems like the band is incapable of making a bad or even average cd , their debut , `` On the Sunday of Life , '' notwithstanding , which was more like a Steven Wilson solo album , anyway . The problem is , while very good , it is not consuming me like past PT records have . In fact , I would say it has no chance of breaking into my top 5 PT albums list , which consists of the five full-length studio albums prior to this one ( `` Signify , '' `` Stupid Dream , '' `` Lightbulb Sun , '' `` In Absentia , '' and `` Deadwing '' ) .The songs are all at least really good , as is the norm with a Porcupine Tree record.. The beast of an epic called `` Anesthetize '' is too stunning to describe with words . You just have to hear it . The title track is a good rocker , and manages to sound `` Deadwing '' -ish at times . The finale , `` Sleep Together , '' closes out the record with a beautiful string arrangement.Overall , I give it 4 stars out of 5 .	1
I 've quickly become a Porcupine Tree fan . I purchased Deadwing and In Absentia first , and then followed that by getting older works . I think Steven Wilson is an amazing song-crafter ( for lack of a better descriptor ) . When I first purchased Fear of a Blank Planet and looked at the total song count - 6 - I was a little disappointed . After I listened to it once , I was struck at the slight evolution their music appeared to take on it . Now , I ca n't stop listening to it . Gavin Harrison is an off-the-charts great drummer and he 's had his chains loosened on this CD . Overall , this is a stunning piece of music , and has to be considered one of the very best from PT and one of the very best for 2007 period .	1
After the less than impressiveSomewhere Elseby Marillion , 2007 was not looking too promising for prog rock fans . But Porcupine once more saved the day ! Their `` Fear of a Blank Planet '' is a direct reference to the Public Enemy album , Fear of a Black Planet ( 1990 ) and it left me gasping for air after the first time I listened to it : so much musical power , so many layers of sound.It can be hard to imagine that barely six tracks can carry the burden of prog rock on their shoulders , but `` Fear of a Blank Planet '' does this task almost effortlessly . Steven Wilson repeats the same lineup he 's had for the past five years . Besides them , the band is accompanied by King Crimson legend Robert Fripp on soundscapes in `` Way Out Of Here '' , Rush 's Alex Lifeson on guitar in `` Anesthetize '' and John Wesley , who had previously appeared onIn AbsentiaandDeadwing , also doing and producing guitar work.The end result is an amazing prog rock album that leaves the genre breathing comfortably and one of the best albums of 2007 .	1
I waited awhile before writing this review because it takes time to really ingest the masterpiece that is Fear of a Blank Planet . I can see similarities musically to Sky Moves Sideways , which I own , and of course moments that may remind one of In Absentia , which I consider to also be a masterful creation . Quite simply put , this is the result of hard work , dedication , and talent . Although I found the subject matter of this particular Steven Wilson tale to be a little less visceral and involved than some of the previous efforts , but than again I also found myself riveted to the lyrics as the music carried me along on a path not beaten since my early days of vegging to old Floyd albums . Yes , this is a concept album in every sense of the word , complete with a 17 minute epic that is really several fine works amalgamated into one continuous and flawless epic . The musical soundscapes are all at once beautifully lush , wonderfully ambient and have the effect of being extremely heavy without becoming oppressive or weighty . The production is as always flawless , and Steven Wilson has again surrounded himself with key players replete with astounding musical proficiency . There is even a cameo from Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson that while resplendent , is still somewhat understated given the vast talents of this man . All in all I must say that if you are indeed a fan of Porcupine Tree or even if you just jumped on the bandwagon after say , Stupid Dream , you can not go wrong with this wonderfully created musical journey into the realm of teenage angst and quiet rebellion . The biggest crime is that one will never hear music this good on commercial radio ... ever .	1
Step 1- Buy CD , Step 2- Insert CD , Step 3- Press Play , Step 4- Press Repeat , Step 5- Set Volume , Step 6- Get comfortable , Step 7- Enjoy the music ! ! !	1
If you 're a fan of Porcupine Tree , you probably already have this . If you 're wondering about PT , and you like prog music , you 'll probably like this too . Not immediately accessible , but it will grow on you .	1
porcupine tree is without a doubt the best band since pink floyd stop touring . their live performances , are on a par with anything on a disc.have seen them five times live the last two times at the nokio in nyc . where they opened with a superior `` fear of a blank planet '' which was outstanding , and continued the second set with songs from the last eight cd 's . blank planet is on a par with `` deadwing '' which was the best cd i have heard for years.this is an incredible band .	1
The more I delve into the utterly daft but still hugely popular 'prog ' sub-genre , the more I feel manipulated and ever-so-slightly seduced . It 's all very glamorous and mystical of course and the more I hear of it ( as if the music 's important ! ) , the more I feel myself slowly initiated in.It 's like art-quicksand : the more you resist and deny , the further you get ever-so-gently pulled in.Thing is ; I 'm enjoying myself immensely . The music just comes in floods , sweeping me along deliriously . I feel like a grinning Robinson Crusoe , shipwrecked from the security blanket of my punk , indie and art-rock , but loving every second of the isolation . My dreams are now in colour too ... . ( yeah , I know ) So far 'Inner Marshland ' , 'Going for the One ' and the superb 'Blues for Allah ' have entranced and mystified me , I feel like I 'm passing tests and now this Porcupine Tree are another challenge on the horizon ; So , deep breath , 'FOABP ' ( yes , and I 'm not a bit shocked.. ) is outstanding in every department . It 's fierce , gentle , haunting , cinematic , brazen ( lol ! ) , profound etc etc.It 's like a good-music intravenous , as I lay dazed and confused in the Garcia Clinic for people who thought they were years ahead , but are really just catching up . 'FOABP ' is SO good ( in a modern sense ) it 's almost un-reviewable . If it was born in the 70 's lets say , I 'd be standing on my tail on this very page , telling you how they do n't make 'em like this anymore ; another satisfactory category for 'FOABP'.It 's got fiery rock guitar , vast banks of whirling string-synth , staccato drumming , and a vocals-man , who obviously understands the lunacy of it all , singing brilliantly tongue-in-cheek lyrics with deadpan seriousness . Irresistible combination that takes some topping.If prodded with something sharp , I 'd say 'My Ashes ' is my favourite song on 'FOABP ' , but it 's a close run thing ( Important point here pop kids : 'FOABP ' deals in the song side of 'prog ' , not like that utter waste 'the Wall ' , that deals in pretension and regressive self-congratulation ) .The 17 minute ( feels like 5 , you just do n't want it to end ! ) 'Anesthetize ' is obviously the centre-piece and HAS to be superb to fend off all the other goodies which are attacking it from all sides , and 'Sentimental ' is another classy ballad . Sort of 'My Ashes'2 , with ethereal piano driving it along to a strutting conclusion . I really ca n't fault it ( and believe me , I 've tried ! ) and this is no knee-jerk notice ; I 've inhabited said Blank Planet for a good two months now ; each sojourn bringing new , previously undiscovered jewels . Yes , it does THAT as well.So ( breathless reviewer pulls himself together ) , must go . Things to do , life to be lived etc ; everything does n't revolve around 'FOABP ' y'know . Ha.Just one more spin ... .	1
As a long term Porcupine Tree fan and in posession of every CD they have put out , I was really looking forward to F.O.A.B.P . I received my CD the day before a week 's holiday in Greece , so immediately downloaded said product onto my mp3 player and listened to it continuosly ( Alongside the new Rush CD `` Snakes and Arrows '' ) . I was present at a Manchester Gig where the band played the whole album six months before it was due to be released so I had a bit of an inclination as to what to expect . It sounded mostly like a continuation of their previous 2 albums ( Deadwing and In Absentia ) at the time , but having listened to the finished article , there were a couple of tracks where `` Lightbulb Sun '' came to mind on the 2 softer tracks ( i.e . My Ashes and Sentimental ) and a touch of `` Sky moves sideways '' atmospherics appears elsewhere . The begining of `` My Ashes '' is very close to Led Zeps `` No Quarter '' . So much has been made of `` Anesthetize '' , and yes , it is without doubt the highlight of the album . The opening to this song is monumental . However , I feel the album could have offered more to us , the fans . Firstly , I believe that `` Anethetize '' should have been chopped into two parts . After 12 or so minutes , it is turned into a completely different vibe and is like a totally new song . Steve Wilson had great joy at introducing the song at Manchester as `` 18 minutes long '' , and the crowd response was just as enthusiastic at hearing the news . Neal Morse 's new CD has a 3 tracks on his new CD `` Sola Scripture '' averaging 23 min . each , and yet each is made up of 6 songs within it . In this case I would rather skip to a favourite piece of the track than have to fast forward . Prog . music is `` Very much alive '' . I would rather have 4 x 5 minute songs highlighting Mr Wilson 's amazing musical talents than one stretched out piece . On `` Voyage 34 '' that was a different story . AHHHHH Voyage 34 . That brings me to another small matter . That CD ( Or `` EP '' as it was known ) totalled 60 min . whereas F.O.A.B.P . ( A full album release ) totals only 50 min . Why is that so ? Finally , I believe the 2 main ingredients that were lacking on this release were the trademark harmonies and also the lack of any guitar solos , apart from Alex Lifeson 's shortis piece on Anesthetize . Steve seems to be putting more emphasis on the heavier chunky sound . Who knows , we could be witnessing an Opeth-like sound on their next release . To me , This CD was like listening to `` Animals '' after the release of `` Wish you were here '' . Do you understand where I am coming from ? Animals was a great album , but not up to the class of Wish you were here . I got more satisfaction listening to both the Blackfield albums honestly.FOOTNOTE - I have just come across a tape of Steve talking on an English Radio station and explaining more about the concept of the album , and it really stuck with me i.e . about the information technology overload our kids have to indulge in . When you go into friends houses , all you see is kids on their Playstations/Nintendos/X box/Laptop etc . I must admit , Steve has really hit the button on an issue to write songs about . No doubt , there is more to come on this subject . For some people , the songwriting is the most important . For me , it is the music that is more paramount . I have to like the music first before I analyse the actual lyrics . When both are merged together in exceptional form the result is a CLASSIC .	1
I 'm a relatively new Tree fan . The first time I discovered them was about three months after Deadwing was released . But in that time , they 've become my favorite band . The way they weave lush textures and dreamlike soundscapes around incredibly catchy melodies is an experience that one would be hard-pressed to find anywhere else . And that 's what Tree music is : an experience . Perhaps their earlier album-oriented records more than their recent song-driven albums , but FOABP is clearly a trip back to their roots . Think as if they had taken the metal out of the last two albums and stuck it into Signify , and you 've got a vague idea as to what FOABP has . But like any other PT album , this one 's tough to classify.This album , however , is not resonating with me like previous albums . It 's definitely a very good album , and it 's definitely more consistent and better than Deadwing , though it just seems to lack the highlights that DW had ( `` Anesthetize '' is no `` Arriving Somewhere '' , but then again , nothing is ) . DW is one of my least-favorite Tree albums , but it did have its moments . FOABP is consistently good throughout , but it never really touches greatness like their masterpieces have.At times , it just feels like PT is trying too hard to outdo itself . I love the 12-minute epic , `` Arriving Somewhere '' , but `` Anesthetize '' , while a very strong track , feels a little too proggy and just goes on for too long . The first two parts are awesome , but the third section ( the song can easily be broken up into three parts ) just feels tacked on to extend it , and it 's honestly a little boring . I hope PT does n't go into Dream Theater territory of trying to put a 20-minute song on every album just because so many people think that any song over 10 minutes is a good song by default.The musicianship is great , even though virtuosity is the last thing I look for in a PT album . Gavin Harrison is quickly showing that he 's one of the greatest and easily the most underrated drummer in the business . Richard Barbieri comes to the forefront on this keyboard-driven album , adding the texture and atmosphere that anyone would expect from a PT album . Listening to this album without headphones would be doing a great disservice to it.But this album IS consistently very good . The title track sounds a bit like Deadwing 's title track , but better . It 's heavier ; the guitar and drums in the intro catch you immediately ; the textures during the chorus cascade in a wall of sound that is precedent for the rest of the album . `` My Ashes '' is a little straightforward and feels like a slightly more lush Blackfield song , but it 's an emotional highlight . `` Sentimental '' follows in this vein with a catchy chorus and more keyboard textures . `` Way Out of Here '' may be the weakest song on the album , but it 's still a good song with ethereal textures , although it goes on for a little too long . `` Sleep Together '' is the highlight of the album . When the keyboards warble in , the listener immediately feels as if he has been thrown into a nightmare . Given the song 's meaning about suicide and escape from this world that the album has been presenting , it 's easily the most sinister song PT has ever released , and in stark contrast to the lulling and gentle album closers PT has been known for . The strings are brought to the forefront and provide what is likely the strongest texture of the album.Still , the album is nowhere near perfect . The lyrics need work . The concept of a youth corrupted by Xbox , prescription drugs , MTV , pornography , and the Internet is presented in the title track , but nothing new is really presented until `` Sleep Together '' , when the idea of suicide is brought out . The prescription drugs idea is overused in every song . PT was never really known for their lyrics , but for an album that 's only 50 minutes long , you would imagine they 'd know how to mix it up a little better . And that 's another weakness : the album is a little too short , especially when you consider there are only six songs . Yes , the songs are generally pretty long , but by the time `` Sleep Together '' comes to its powerful conclusion , you 're left wanting more.The greatest issue I have is that FOABP just does n't deliver on every front . None of the songs have any subtlety to them . The wall of sound is good to an extent , but at times , less might just be more . The album just feels too heavy all around , even on the lighter songs . The strength of In Absentia , their second-strongest album in my opinion , was that it seemed to incorporate everything they 've ever done . It may have been less consistent , but it touched on every base and took you on an emotional rollercoaster . Stupid Dream , my favorite PT album , had the greatest power to manipulate the mind and created the perfect bridge between their purely psychedelic albums and their rock-oriented albums . FOABP , on the other hand , just seems to hit you like a wrecking ball over and over again . The death metal section at the end of the second section of `` Anesthetize '' personifies this perfectly . That 's okay when that 's what you 're looking for , but that 's not what I 've come to expect from the Tree . I did n't come to listen to Opeth.Do n't let this keep you from buying the album , though . It 's a great album and still miles ahead of 95 % of the crap that 's out there . But in the high standards that I hold for my favorite band , I just feel a little let down . Just a little.Fear of a Blank Planet - 9/10My Ashes - 8.5/10Anesthetize - 9.5/10Sentimental - 8/10Way out of Here - 7.5/10Sleep Together - 10/10	1
I 'll keep it short , an 18 minutes track ( anesthetize ) that takes you places , that alone is worth the money , the rest is just gravy . Kudos to Steve and the band .	1
For many , this is one of the big albums to watch in 2007 . In certain circles , at any rate , there has been a lot of rather assuming talk , with phrases like potential ` album of the year ' thrown around . Ancillary to this , some of us were privileged enough to hear the entire thing in rough , prototype form live last year , and the textures and dynamics evident in some of the entrancing music we heard that evening certainly suggested something special waiting in the wings . Finally , a lot has been made of the fact that ( supposedly ) this album functions as one continuous 50-minute cycle of music , and that the lyrics deal pretty much exclusively with Wilson 's fears that the younger generation is risking descent into intellectual torpor owing to their addiction to an oh-so lethal cocktail of prescription drugs , MTV , internet addiction and banal culture of necessary instant gratification.For me , however , none of the above really has much bearing on the album itself . Sonically , the six pieces here ( which are distinct enough not to flow together the way , say Light of Day , Day of Darkness does ) present an interesting proposition . Crucially , the narcotic core of their sound has been left largely intact , with outrageously catchy melodies , dense , layered and painstakingly executed production , careful , wandering bass-lines and lush , intricate harmonies all present in abundance . There is a slightly more heavy approach evident , but overall the album is remarkably spacey and dreamy , with a lot of attention given to synth washes , soundscapes and somnambulistic melodies , all rather reminiscent of their The Sky Moves Sideways era . But this is juxtaposed with the tight songwriting and straightforward riffing of later releases . If their are any new elements , and I 'm inclined to say there are , they emerge in subtle ways : Wilson 's vocals , which have changed little over recent years , seem more brazen and stretched , while some of the melodies seem more intricate , more assured and composed , and take time for the listener to fully appreciate.The title track turns on a riff that is highly reminiscent of ` Deadwing ' , while the chorus has a kind of gentle brutality that is somewhat jarring . The rhythmic vocals over the verse have an interesting , pseudo-rap like quality . The outro is dreamy and unexpected . ` My Ashes ' is stunning , with that perfect verse/chorus interplay Wilson excels at , lush orchestration and nebulous , highly evocative lyrics . The wordless vocal which rounds off the song engenders a kind of urbane emotional atmosphere , a beautiful dignity.And then to ` Anesthetize ' , which stands well out of the crowd simply by virtue of being 17 minutes long ! Live , this track was instantly memorable and impressive , and here it does not disappoint . Wilson seems to have shoehorned just about every facet of his remarkable music making skills inside . The four minute introduction is sinister , haunting and deceptively melodic . The four to around 11 minute mark is utterly replete with intricacies , yet never overblown : indeed , it displays an uncanny use of shifting dynamics and sustained tension , of the kind Tool have often used so effectively . A slow build is embellished by an ornate Alex Lifeson solo with a welcome exotic tinge , before the heavy riffing slides into view , along with a great , eerie verse and one of their most breathtaking choruses . Then we are hit with something pretty surprising at 11 minutes - suffice to say the song implodes in spectacular fashion , and the excellent outro is ushered in , all sepia tinged sunsets and darkened skies.To follow that , the gorgeous ` Sentimental ' harks back to earlier albums slightly , with an intro reminiscent of ` Collapse the Light Into Earth ' , and a breakdown towards the end which re-introduces the riff from ` Trains ' in slightly moderated form , a happening I 've not entirely figured out . Despite this , the gentle lilt of the chorus is possibly Wilson 's most effective evocation of sheer melancholy ( no mean feat ! ) . ` Way Out of Here ' is perhaps the most interesting song , a kind of psychedelic metal experiment , although ` Sleep Together ' pushes it close , a kind of apocalyptic industrial tinged nightmare , with lyrics seeming to equate suicide with sexual release.Maybe not as much a massive leap forward then , as a consolidation , and certainly a near flawless , very tightly constructed album with a lot of depth , as the whole picture will take quite a lot of listens to emerge . Including only six songs does ensure welcome brevity and consistency . In many ways , which perhaps I 've not entirely made apparent , this is their most complex record ; at any rate , it is certainly extremely dense . Whether it is their best record , or album of the year is , however , open to debate . Nevertheless , it comes highly recommended .	1

Label - Atlantic Records.COMMENTS : Continued brilliance from The Tree . While `` Fear Of A Blank Planet '' did n't hit me on first spin like `` In Absentia '' ( 2002 ) did , it 's still ultra fine music from PT mastermind Steven Wilson . Nothing new as far as lyrics go - still dealing with loneliness , rejection , a dark childhood , and a bleak future outlook . I feel `` Fear '' takes a step closer to the band 's past - reverting back to `` Signify '' ( 1996 ) and perhaps `` Stupid Dream '' ( 1999 ) - giving you much more mood and atmosphere , and less rock & pop . Where `` In Absentia '' and `` Deadwing '' ( 2005 ) had more tracks geared toward the 4 minute `` rock '' song , `` Fear '' gives you 6 lengthy tracks ( 4 of the 6 songs are 7 minutes or longer ... with `` Anesthetize '' just under 18 minutes all by itself ) . `` Fear '' starts off with the title track ... I feel this song is oddly similar to `` Deadwing 's '' title track . Though my least favorite track on the album , it 's still a good rock song with a husky jam in the middle ( though nothing groundbreaking ) . Track 2 is where the album takes flight for me . `` My Ashes '' starts slow with keyboards/piano and acoustic guitar ... with orchestra and the rest of the band joining in later . Simply a beautiful composition . On first listen , `` My Ashes '' hit me hard ... in the same vein as `` Even Less '' - one of my all-time favorite PT songs . `` Anesthetize '' is the marathon song - lengthy in all respects . As much as Lifeson 's guitar solo stands out ( his best work in 2007 is here , not on Rush 's `` Snakes & Arrows '' ) , it 's Harrison 's drumming that intrigues me . In fact , Harrison 's drumming throughout the album simply sparkles . `` Anesthetize '' features ups and downs and a wide range of emotions with some great guitar work from Wilson.. and this song is on par with PT 's other lengthy hard driving jam tune , `` Arriving Somewhere But Not Here '' from `` Deadwing '' . Through tracks 2 and 3 , there are several moments where the keyboards/synth reminds me of Led Zeppelin 's John Paul Jones ' work on `` No Quarter '' ... dark , eerie , perfect . `` Sentimental '' starts and closes as a pretty piano ballad with the band joining nicely in the middle ... another wonderful song . `` Way Out Of Here '' is the moodiest track - thanks to Robert Fripp ... a soft beginning and an extremely heavy ending . The closer `` Sleep Together '' starts out with a very industrial feel to it . But then it kicks in and synth/orchrestra takes over ... giving it a holier than tho tone . `` Fear Of A Dark Planet '' has a slightly different flavor to it then their last 2 albums ... maybe the new record label ( Atlantic ) had something to do with that ( probably not - though Lava Records , Snapper and Madfish labels may be a thing of the past for PT ) ; or maybe it 's been Wilson 's recent collaberative work with Aviv Geffen and their `` Blackfield '' albums which seem to be a bit mellower and more keyboard driven . Give this album time - it will get better with repeated spins . Either way , Porcupine Tree has the brains , the production tools , and the chops to release some great albums for years to come . Another excellent release ( 5 stars ) .	1
If you have n't latched on to the Porcupine Tree phenomenon by now then you probably do n't like this kind of music at all . It 's modern , innovative and incredibly exciting art and there 's not a dull moment to be found . Progressive rock is alive and well ...	1
Maybe it 's a big statement to claim that Porcupine Tree are the new Dire Straits , but if that is n't the case , then hopefully some can agree that Steve Wilson et al bring many of the same catchy and intelligent songwriting skills to the mix as Knopfler and co. did back in their hayday.On first listen , this did n't stick with me the same way that 'In Absentia ' did , but on subsequent spins , I was able to finally start listening to it as a different type of album , and I really enjoyed it . Where 'In Absentia ' succeeded in exploring a lot of different musical and thematic terrain , this album is very much a concentrated effort . That is n't to say that it does n't bring a lot of variety to the table , but there is a very clear concept.I feel like the time Wilson spent working with Opeth really paid off , and the heavier moments on this album and 'In Absentia ' definitely help keep things lively . Overall , this is a superb release and I think it will sit well with most prog fans .	1
`` Fear of a Blank Planet '' is heavy - musically and emotionally . Those hoping for the uplifting harmonies of `` Lazarus '' or the sonic guitar explorations of 90 's era PT wo n't find that here.What the listener will find on FoaBP is a musical and lyrical journey into the youthful psyche of modern life , from the point of view of those addicted to - yet alienated by - the trappings of western culture . If you enjoyed Dark Side of the Moon or The Wall by Pink Floyd , Melancholie and the Infinite Sadness by Smashing Pumpkins , or Amused to Death by Roger Waters , chances are you 'll enjoy this CD as well.Unlike most bands categorized as progressive rock , Steven Wilson 's Porcupine Tree has always been able to inject tons of emotion into the music , even as they perform songs that change times and tempos and weave intricate lines and melodies together . FoaBP is no exception , and - keeping in mind that each PT album is distinct from the others - I think it 's their most brilliant album so far.Much like Amused to Death by Roger Waters , it took me a few listens to really appreciate this particular album . I was so used to Deadwing , their previous disc , which is a collection of very different songs that could work as the soundtrack for a script Wilson co-wrote with Mike Bennion . There are only six tracks on this CD , and they are not radio friendly ( a plus in my book ) .As for the songs on this album , `` Fear of a Blank Planet '' comes out of the gate with percussive acoustic guitar picking that 's soon joined by swirling guitars and PT 's trademark drum sound . `` My Ashes '' is the closest you 'll get to `` Lazarus '' on FoaBP - it 's just as beautiful as Lazarus but in a darker way - and you can feel the lonliness and disconnection in the words and warbling keyboards . `` Anesthetized '' is the long centerpiece of FoaBP , somewhat like `` Arriving Somewhere '' is on Deadwing , but it 's actually two songs put together ( a 12 minute piece featuring Rush 's Alex Lifeson on the guitar solo , and a 4 minute piece with amazing vocal harmonies that are far less poppy than the ones on `` In Absentia '' ) .Listening to `` Sentimental '' , you 'll know how it feels to grow up anesthetized and come out of it older and lost . `` Way out of Here '' expresses the disconnect from family and the loss of attachment and affinity for those who care.Porcupine Tree are musicians of the finest caliber , and Steven Wilson is progressive rock 's best songwriter . FoaBP tells an emotional story of depression , alienation , drug abuse , and apathy . By time you hear `` Sleep Together '' you too might think that the cure for it all is to burn your clothes , erase everything from your computer and online profiles , and find refuge in the closeness of another human being.After all , is n't that what we 're subconsiously seeking through our devices and material objects ?	1
I highly anticipated this release from Prog . Rock greats Porcupine Tree , and I was n't dissapointed . This album follows the pretty much the same formula , as far as musical style , as their 2 previous albums In Absentia and Deadwing . But there is some new wrinkles , and some good wrinkles at that . First off , this album 's concept becomes more clear than previous PT releases . Themes of this album , as taken from their official website are : `` a 21st century cocktail of MTV , sex , prescription drugs , video games , the internet , terminal boredom , and subsequent escape . '' As usual , Steven Wilson has written some great songs here , both lyrically and musically . Though there are only 6 tracks here , they mesh together very well , so well , they could fit together to become one long track . As said before , musically , the album sounds quite similiar to the last 2 PT releases , with heavier guitar parts mixed with great melodies and beautiful piano pieces that pull you in . And though I really like this album , I can not automatically give this release 5 stars . One reason is that I think the theme of the album is so apparent , it kinda takes away from the listener 's imagination a bit . The lyrics are so direct at times , the listener ca n't always attach their own meaning to them . For the most part , I enjoy lyrics that say a lot without telling you nothing ... if that makes sense . Do n't get me wrong , these lyrics are n't bad , not by a long shot . Steven Wilson is an amazing lyricist as well as musician , but I just would have liked for the main theme of the piece to be a bit more indirect . My other complaint , though a small one , is the number of tracks . I know , when writing these kinds of `` concept '' albums , an artist should say what they want , and when the theme or message is done , it 's done . Whether its 1 , 5 , or 26 tracks..but as a fan , I 'm left wanting more than just 6 tracks . Now , granted , all the tracks are good lengths , especially with the song `` Anesthetize '' which clocks in at over 17 minutes . With that said , I would have to say , in my opinion , is the best overall track on the album . It starts off great , keeps the listener interested , and has great tempo changes , a great balance of musical interludes and lyrics ; everything you want from a track of this length.With all this said , if you 're a Porcupine Tree fan or just a prog . rock fan in general , you should love this album , there no reason not to . This is some really good material from this highly underrated band . They have been honing their craft for years , and Steven Wilson and Co. sound crisper and sharper than ever . I look forward to many more great albums from them in the future .	1
There is no doubt that PT is one of the better current rock groups , and `` Fear of a Blank Planet '' is another gem from this talented band . The only other discs I 've heard by PT are their previous two and `` Stupid Dream '' and for me , this is on par with those releases.The title track punch starts the disc with upbeat rhythms and a catchy although limited chorus . The verses rule on this tune . `` My Ashes '' is a spacey ballad with some awesome string arrangements and this is one of my favorite tunes on the disc . `` Anesthetize '' starts off sounding a little like Radiohead with a quiet medium tempo groove ; the tune builds slowly adding distorted guitars , heavier rhythms , a decent solo by Alex Lifeson and then some frenzied riffage takes over briefly . The last five minutes of the song are very mellow but tasty , almost Floydish . `` Sentimental '' is medium tempo hypnotic tune that borrows a lick from `` Trains '' towards the end of the song . The entire band wrote the music to `` Way Out Of Here '' , nice job , they should write more songs together . Another spacey intro builds into a heavy section with some tricky drum fills and double-kick work . The soundscapes by Fripp add a creepy vibe to parts of the song . Great tune . Finally , `` Sleep Together '' is kind of a popish tune with a repetitive keyboard rhythm that bounces through most of the song.Overall , this is a solid album with no filler and would be a good beginning for someone new to PT , but I 'm not sure why it 's causing so much argument between fans .	1
This is a great cd , capturing the Airplane on an exceptionally good night . The version of `` Volunteers '' is better than any other live version of the song I 've heard and `` The Other Side of This Life '' is a powerful mixture of the `` Bless its ... '' version and the earlier trippier versions of the song . `` Ballad of Me and You and Pooneil '' is also magnificent . Jack 's bass palaying is fantastic , Jorma shows why he is the most underated guitarist in rock history and Grace sings in key ! BUY THIS CD !	1
The Airplane never stopped flying , and this was perhaps the highest altitude they achieved in the 60 's . An electric blues band with folk undertones so one can relate . This is one of the best live disc of my entire collection . Highly recommendable classic music from a social time .	1
When I first saw 'Sweeping Up the Spotlight ' listed , I was a little sceptical . After all we had already had two official live albums from RCA as well as a whole host of other releases in the so called 'grey market ' . To add to this , the tracklisting for 'Spotlight ' looked overly familiar - and I was beginning to wonder whether there was actually ever a Balin era concert when they they did n't do 'The Other Side of This Life ' . I really should have known better . The Airplane 's capacity for innovation and reinvention is underpinned here by their trademark instrumental prowess and some wonderful three part harmonies . 'Pooneil'features a virtual masterclass in improvisation from Jack Casady as well as series of especially deranged and discordant 'Zappaesque ' sound effects at the beginning . In fairness it should be pointed out that two of the twelve performances appeared a few years back on the expanded ( Legacy ) version of 'Volunteers ' . But they sound far better here in the context of the whole concert - and we have a bonus in Balin 's 'Dresses Too Short ' - the only official version of this one we 've heard before is the one from the Box Set - dating from Marty 's one off performance with the band in 1972 . The attractive booklet contains a short but reflective essay from Jorma Kaukonen . This concert represents the Airplane at their most musically mature . Woodstock and their five classic studio albums are behind them . And yet the purity of their music has yet to be compromised by the departure of Marty Balin and the arrival of later extraneous members . Even if you are not chronically addicted to the Airplane 's music you will love this one .	1
Mark Ronson is talented beyond his years and this album shows that he is more than someone who can tip a hat to the 60s . He has assembled a high-talent roster , but even if he did n't coax great , apt performances from Lily Allen , Santo Gold , Robbie Williams and the Daptone Horns ( among others ) , he still would be dishing up hot , catchy tracks that transcend pop appeal . He knows how to masterfully manipulate the music and get vital sounds from his musicians . This is a great album ! Oh , and if you like what he did with `` Toxic '' check out a different but equally cool version on the Shawn Lee 's Ping Pong Orchestra effort on `` Hits the Hits '' which is also a unique take on pop songs .	1
I bought this cd for Amy Winehouse 's cover of Valerie , Which is so ridiculously good . Looking at the track listing was Intriguing , but I was n't sure if I would know many of the songs . The Coldplay cover by the Dap-tone horns is really cool , I feel like I 'm in `` Snatch '' or another British caper movie when I hear it . I think this cd has a good range of different sounds on it , and I love the rebirth of 60 's Motown style . I would recommend this for any Amy Winehouse fan , as well as fans of UK style Electronic/dance music . I might also recommend Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings too , her voice parallels Ms. Winehouse , but she has more experience , less drama , plus the horns are awesome	1
With his smug smirk , his quirky accent ( not quite British , not quite east coast American ) and his irritating habit of dropping celebrity names into every interview I 've certainly seen of him , Mark Ronson is a man I 've found difficult to like.But the producer & DJ to the stars ( he played at Tom Cruise 's wedding , apparently ) makes darn good music , there 's no running away from that . He was responsible for half of Amy Winehouse'sBack to Black , produced a track on Lily Allen'sAlright , Stilland a track on Adele's19 , which I 'm really getting into at the moment.On this album - a selection of cover versions - he displays an incredible talent for musical reinterpretation . I 've been resisting this album ever since it came out but eventually caved in . I 'm so glad I did . I feel like I already own it anyway , as I know all the singles he 's released from it so far ( from the radio ) and really love the innovative and thought provoking videos he put out to promote them.The man is certainly eclectic , going over tunes by the likes of The Zutons , Coldplay , Radiohead , The Jam , Britney Spears , Kaiser Chiefs and Kasabian , just to name a few , and reinterpreting their music in ways that I personally find very difficult to categorise . It 's good stuff though ; modern with a hint of retro with some banging beats . My favourites include `` Stop Me '' featuring Daniel Merriweather , `` Valerie '' featuring Amy Winehouse and `` Oh My God '' featuring Lily Allen . They all sound much better on my system at home than they did on the radio or on MTV Base . His version of Coldplay 's `` God Put A Smile On Your Face '' featuring The Daptone Horns ( Ronson definitely loves his horns ) is also really cool and currently being used on practically every reality/factual TV programme here , or so it seems , and I also enjoy `` Amy '' featuring Kenna and `` LSF '' featuring Kasabian . I thought I 'd like `` The Only One I Know '' featuring Robbie Williams ( Ronson is reported to be working on Williams ' forthcoming album ) but I did n't , no matter how hard I tried to . His version of Britney Spears ' `` Toxic '' featuring Tiggers ( and O.D.B . ) is certainly hysterical if nothing else and I 'm just starting to like his new single `` Just '' , the old Radiohead song , which on here , features Phantom Planet.The man 's done good and has had a very good run . `` Stop Me '' made it to # 2 on the UK Top 40 , he won a producer of the year 2008 Grammy the other day for producing his portion of `` Back To Black '' and won best male 2008 Brit Award - the first time the award has been given to someone who did n't actually sing on the winning album - and `` Valerie '' , which also made it to # 2 , is currently the longest reigning single in the UK Top 40 . It 's been there for 32 weeks and currently stands at # 13 . I think we 'll be seeing and hearing more of Ronson in the years to come . I 'm sure he 'll grow on me eventually ; )	1
If George Strait started doing stand up it would be something like Rodney Carrington ( Obviouly George would have to go 'blue ' with the language . lol ) . With the jeans , shirt and cowboy hat , he is not far from being a country singer - and he can sing as well as be funny . I 'm new to the world of Rodney so I can not really compare this DVD to anything he 's done in the past but now I am a new fan.The songs are the most entertaining part of his show and , if you do n't listen to the lyrics too closely , you 'd swear you was watching a George Strait acoustic show . By that I mean the guy can actually carry a tune - the comedy is not in his bad singing but in the lyrics . The way he sings with funny facial expressions is hillarious and his piano player sideman getting into the act as well by going off on tangents singing until Rodney stops him . I am not easily offended at all so if you are , this guy is not for you . Funny is funny , if you ca n't handle profanity or sexual references then you should probably stick to something like Bill Cosby . Otherwise , this DVD is well worth buying and it makes you wonder how far Rodney would get if he actually turned into a serious singer ( which in the bonus materials on the DVD , he says he has no intention of doing ) .The bonus feature is entertaining too . You get to see Rodney meet the fans , hang out backstage and hear a few new songs not on the stand-up show including a 'serious ' song he wrote about a friend of his who passed away . Be sure and listen to that one.A very funny and entertaining DVD unless your a fuddy duddy who ca n't handle language .	1
I purchased this dvd as a gift for my fiance who is a big Rodney fan and he was delighted with it . I 've watched it with him and although it 's not really my type of humor - found myself laughing right along with him .	1
Saw this on Comedy Central . Ordered it to see the whole show uninterrupted . Glad I did . The boy 's a keeper . Not for the fainthearted .	1
There 's no question that all the members of Spock 's Beard have displayed mastery of their respective instruments over the years , so it should n't be any surprise that guitarist Alan Morse might attempt a solo album , right ? But what IS a big surprise ( for those of us who know him only from his playing with the Beard ) is the kind of music he 's chosen to play here . First of all , it 's all instrumental - pretty radical when you think of some of the complex vocal tunes ( e.g . `` Thoughts '' and `` Gibberish '' ) that SB is known for . And secondly , it 's a guitar fusion album - nothing like the symphonic prog-pop of SB1 or the prog-metal of SB2 . This is a very enjoyable album with 63 minutes of creative melodies and energy , a little funk thrown in on some tunes , and even some Spanish guitar stylings . Morse wrote all of the compositions , with assistance from his brother Neal in places . ( I think I know that guy from somewhere too ! ) Reminiscent at various times of the rock fusion of guitar virtuosos Joe Satriani , Steve Vai and Jeff Beck , this album is a real pleasant surprise for me , and a great showcase for the talents of one Alan Morse . Well done ! I value interesting music that is played and recorded well . This cd 's rating was based on : Music quality = 8.8/10 ; Performance = 9/10 ; Production = 9/10 ; CD length = 10/10.Overall score weighted on my proprietary scale = 9.0 ( `` 4-1/2 stars '' )	1
Music : 8/10 Production : 5/5Total : 13/15Alan Morse is the highly talented guitar player from Spock 's Beard . He breaks out with a fantastic solo album . Spock 's Beard is a great prog rock band . Unfortunately , Alan and his brother Neal on keyboards and vocals split a few years ago . SB lives on with Alan and is n't quite as good.For Alan , his solo album is a jazz rock tour de force . He 's managed to assemble another fantastic lineup of musicians . Everyone in the band is a virtuoso in their own right . But , the music is led by Alan and some amazing guitar playing . A couple of songs pay homage to old Yes , but mostly it 's original and moving.The production on the album is sparkling and crystal clear . Anyone who wants to learn to record and master should put this on their reference list.Overall , if you want to hear some great jazz rock , this is a great album to get . Highly recommended .	1
Gordon MacRae is a wonderful vocalist popular in an era when you had to be exceptional just to standout . Give Jasmine credit for bringing a generous amount of his material to fans on CD . The audio has a processed sound quality and I rather doubt it represents original source material . It lacks a certain definition and crispness , perhaps the limitation of the recording technology of the early to mid-50 's . Even still , this is a recording worth owning .	1
Joel MacRae sang everything so beautifully . It could be sacred music or popular songs . You always felt he was the right singer to perform any song .	1
British band Travis referred to themselves as `` the invisible band '' on their breakthrough release of the same name . Maybe there 's some truth to that , for even when they were listed as up-and-comers on the then emerging network MTV2 , their albums never really sold very well . It 's too bad because their latest release The Boy with No Name is pretty darn good.Listeners should be pleased with smooth tracks like `` Three Times and You Lose '' and `` New Amsterdam '' , as well as more romantic fare like `` Closer '' and `` Under the Moonlight '' . And `` Out in Space '' has to be one of most well-engineered songs I have ever heard , especially because even though that catchy drumbeat only exists at the beginning of the song , it feels like you 're actually seeing them in concert . I also wonder what version of the album I have because the edition I own has a thirteenth track , `` Sailing Away '' , which is also good ( anyone for Napster ? ) .The only problem with Travis is that a lot of their songs are structured the same . Not that they use the same subject matter or even the same music or vocal stylings , but many of the songs have the second chorus just repeated until the end of the song , with an occasional ten to fifteen-second break . I know that a lot of artists structure songs that way , but a bridge every now and then would n't hurt . I also could have done without Fran saying `` I heart everything about you '' at the beginning of `` Big Chair '' , but that can be easily ignored . The Boy with No Name is definitely worth picking up.Anthony Rupert	1
Travis return with their brand of melodic but melancholic rock , and that choir boy voice , aped since by fellow Brits Coldplay and Keane.Titled after lead singer Fran Healey 's son who was nameless for a while after being born recently , `` The boy who had no name '' opens with the downbeat Simon & Garfunkel-like `` 3 times and you lose '' , followed by the upbeat Motown-like `` Selfish Jean '' .Lead off single `` Closer '' is a rather dreamy , melancholic tune , with superb , echoing vocal effects.Other standouts are `` Big chair '' , the sweeping `` Eyes wide open '' ( with edgy guitars ) , the touching `` My eyes '' ( which seems to be about Healey 's son ) , the ballads `` One night '' ( pretty and jangly ) , `` Out in space '' ( complete with alien-like effects ) , and the woozy `` Colder '' . `` Under the moonlight '' features KT Tunstall.Tight harmonies , beautiful guitar and piano work , and personal lyrics , just what we 've come to expect from Travis ! !	1
I loved this when I watched it on HBO and now I love it even more by just hanging in my DVD shelf . It has the full concert plus some interesting extra content like interviews and backstage scenes . If you 're into JT do n't think it much and click add to cart and take this one home ! And even if you 're not too keen , if you 're reading this ... There must be a reason , get on the JT wagon and let 's ride !	1
I bought this to replace one i lost during moving . This is by far my favorite concert by him . I ca n't wait until 'The 20/20 Experience ' Concedrt DVD comes out ! ! !	1
Every DVD release Sammy does gets better and better . He just continues to get better with age ... and I like him a heck of a lot better outside of Van Halen . As others have said , this is almost like being there . Crank it up and party with the Red Rocker.Now , how about a reissue of the amazing MTV 1983 concert on DVD ! ! !	1
At some point when I was in high school I declared that if I could have the voice of any rock singer in the world , then I would want to sing like Greg Lake . Now , I probably would prefer to be able to play every keyboard in the world like Keith Emerson and I might have to flip a coin if the choice was between having Greg Lake 's voice or being able to sing a phrase like Frank Sinatra , but ever since the first time I heard `` Lucky Man '' I have really liked the sound of this guy 's voice . I am not alone in that regard and there are Greg Lake fans who go back to before Emerson , Lake and Palmer when he was the lead singer for King Crimson , which explains why `` In the Court of the Crimson King '' is the opening track in the concert on the first disc of `` Greg Lake : Live in Concert . `` I was rather surprised that most of the songs in the concert are from the ELP days including `` From the Beginning '' ( just once I would love to see Lake start that song on the guitar and launch into `` Roundabout '' instead ) , `` Touch and Go '' ( Okay , that is an Emerson Lake and Powell song , but two out of three ai n't bad ) , a version of `` Take a Pebble '' that takes advantage of Florian Opahle on acoustic guitar , `` I Believe in Father Christmas , '' `` Farewell to Arms , '' `` Fanfare for the Common Man , '' `` Footprints in the Snow , '' `` Lucky Man , '' `` Pictures at an Exhibition , '' and `` Karn Evil 9 ( 1st Impression - Part 2 ) '' for the encore . I was even more surprised that `` Lucky Man '' was really the only ballad that Lake sang ( he tells the story of how it became the last addition to ELP 's debut album ) , because I was expecting to hear more songs like `` Still ... You Turn Me On '' and some of the tracks from his side of ELP 's `` Works : Volume 1 . '' I should add that `` The Sage '' part of `` Pictures at an Exhibition '' would count as being a ballad . But the only song from his solo career in the concert is `` Love You Too Much '' and there is a second King Crimson track with `` 21st Century Schizoid Man . '' The concert is enjoyable and while Lake is losing power on his upper register there are plenty of moments in many of these songs where he does not have to go that high and I remember why his was the voice I coveted most in my youth.The second disc starts off with what would be called `` Greg Lake : Live in Rehearsal , '' which consists of a half-dozen full length tracks from the pre-tour rehearsals ( all performed on disc 1 except for one of the aforementioned missing ballads ) mixed with backstage footage and interviews with band members and others associated with the tour . A short documentary on `` The Band '' has more interviews with the members , who explain how they came to be in Greg Lake 's band ( there is a nice bit where David Arch , who plays keyboards and is the group 's musical director , explains how they did not intend to go the whole Keith Emerson route with lots of keyboards but could not avoid picking up an organ , a moog , a couple of more keyboards and eventually a second keyboard player ) . The final treat is a live performance of `` I Believe in Father Christmas '' performed live at St. Bride 's Church on London 's Fleet Street . Lake plays one of the two acoustic guitars accompanied by a keyboard player , the church 's choir and Jethro Tull 's Ian Anderson on flute . The sound is not perfect ( I have trouble understanding the minister 's introduction ) , but fan 's will still be enthralled . Too bad they did not also do Anderson 's `` Christmas Song , '' because that is my second favorite `` prog-rock '' Christmas song . But three versions of Lake 's Christmas song on two discs is a pretty sweet.deal , especially this far out from the Holiday season .	1
Young , talented band surrounds seasoned master ( Greg Lake ) and offer a fresh sound to some great classic prog rock ! Highlights- Fanfare For The Common Man , Pictures at an Exhibition ( better than the original ) , 21st Century Schizoid Man ... .Decent sound and video quality . Buy it . Great addition to the video library .	1
This DVD set is fantastic . Greg Lake put together a great band ( a young , great band ) , and they all learned to rock out Greg 's songs . Althought he is older in this , and a little chubby , his singing voice is still beautiful , and powerful . The first DVD ( of the concert ) is great . But the second DVD , with the rehearsals , is much better . The videos of the Greg and co. rehearsing are the best versions of the songs , imho.There is one thing that these DVDs prove beyond a shadow of a doubt- Greg Lake does n't need Keith Emerson to have an incredible career in music . He does n't need Emerson at all . It is very interesting to hear Floria 's guitar interpretations of Keith Emerson 's keyboard work . His way of playing these songs is refreshing , a definite rock interpretation . The keyboardwork of this band is completely different from Emerson 's , but sounds great . Yes , ELP did excellent originals , and , in some cses , are better than the music of this package . But Greg and co. breathe new life into them.BUY THIS . I 'm not kidding ...	1
But no problem there Folks . This band sounds better then `` Sea Shanties '' and `` Hawkwind '' in that same category of style and sound , but much better Band on selection of sounds . Members from Asia and Europe but sing in English , have to say that because when buying CD 's or Albums in the USA , most fans want the ultimate if You know what I mean ! And singing in English is one of them ! Same Go 's with all those European Movies in the '70s as well , `` The Clockmaker '' and `` Spirts of the Died '' with Stamp and His natural English Voice for instance ! Well , any way , not making a BIG DEAL on everything , let 's just make another Anthology Album or CD , shall We , here goes ! Play `` High Jack '' for about a couple of minutes when the violins fade out , then play `` Soap Shop Rock '' ( 0:57 ) , then `` Halluzination Guillotine '' the rest of the way ! Fade in between the songs , sounds much better ! `` Wolf City '' and `` Jail , House and Frog '' ! Great Stuff For Your Library !	1
This latest release in Colin Davis ' ongoing LSO Sibelius Cycle is really among if not THE best Sibelius Second to have . The atmosphere which is created especially in the second movement can hardly be compared to other recordings , not even Davis ' own three former interpretations on disc or Bernstein 's great romantic recording with the Vienna Philharmonic . I would n't say that this one is anywhere near heroic , but let 's be honest ... does it always has to be heroic ? `` Heroic '' seems to be the key word in other reviews concerning Sibelius grand Second Symphony but I think that almost all these `` heroic '' accounts lack some kind of inner detail in the slow movements and tend to be somewhat superficial . This new recording by Davis is n't heroic at all but it 's honest ... .and that 's far more important to me . In contrast to the great atmosphere and perfectly woven inner themes of the orchestra the first and last movement show such a Grandeur that one literally sees Sir Colin sweeping away with grand gestures . Although some will find his relative slow tempi ( even compared to his own earlier recordings ) hard to swallow , it 's exactly this choice that makes this recording grand and a sovereign of it 's own ! The tone poem Pohjola 's Daughter is also much more than just a filler and makes the single instruments and performances incredible transparent.Let 's hope that Sir Colin will soon finish his ( probably last ) Sibelius cycle with the fabulous LSO and will end it with a great Sibelius First with exactly as much grandeur as this awesome Second has !	1
British critics are slavish admirers of Colin Davis 's Sibelius , and this CD is touted as a Gramophone Selection of the Month . I began listening with doubts , since to my ears Davis 's Sibelius can be stodgy and uneventful . However , it 's hard to resist the utterly clear and natural sonics that the LSO Live engineers deliver , far better than anything Davis got form Philips or RCA/BMG his first two times out -- this is his third complete Sibelius cycle.As for the interpretation , it 's patient and measured , but with lots of inner detail and great pacing for effect . I do n't know if Davis has become a master or if I am simply more tolerant of his understated style . Barbirolli brought a similar measured individuality to the Sibelius Second in his famous recording ( Chesky ) , but he was more emotional and rhythmically free than Davis . Davis does n't give us much drama from moment to moment ( The Gramophone turns this lack into a virtue , claiming that it 's all about long-term buildup and architecture ) , but the LSO musicians play beautifully , and the engineers keep up the sexcellent sound.Is there a great buildup to a cathartic climax ? In the first movement I 'd say yes , although Bernstein is more hair-raising and Karajan more grand . English restraint still counts for a lot in Davis 's style -- the second movement does n't pull you back and forth as violently as it could , but the orchestral sound is deep and rich . The Vivacissimo scherzo should be a whirlwind ; here it 's only a strong breeze , and the gorgeous oboe melody in the trio is lethargic . The finale should burst on the scene in tidal waves of brass chords and swooping strings , but Davis 's retraint holds the tide in check . NOt fatally , I should add . Wtihout being volcanic , this Sibelius Second ends with a triumphant sweep.I am no expert in Davis 's other Sibelius cycles , having owned them only for a while , but if knowledgable critics claim that this is his best Second , I do n't mind agreeing . It certainly sounds grand .	1
This album proves that real singers still exist . Joan 's amazing pipes shine thorugh on this album proving it 's possible to get better and better even when you thoughtshe was already great . Somehow this album captures her true pocket , soulful , dreamy thick songs that feature a master class in vocals . Best album of the year ! ! ! !	1
Fantastic vocal work ( man what taste in phrasing ! ) , great playing , great new versions of soul standards ( easily the best covers she 's recorded ) - and her best writing to date make this my favorite J.O . recording since she covered `` blue million miles '' .3 minutes in and I too was thinking `` Dusty level '' ! ! ! I 've never had that thought before while listening to anybody . Joan Osborne is getting better and better , sounding a little more mature and completely comfortable in her own skin/with her own pipes . supremely understated throughout ! took me almost the entire song to adjust to the change in lyric on `` ai n't no sunshine '' but by the time Joan comes back in after a KILLER keyboard solo you cant help but be down with it.It is great to see HER smile on the back cover and I cant wait to listen to her sing `` baby is a butterfly '' again , so i 'm outa here . thank you Joan .	1
`` What is this music ? '' I asked when hearing it at a friends house How tawdry I felt when I had to find the disc in the `` alternative '' section . But where does he belong ? He is a brilliant performer and a superb ( if somewhat idiosyncratic ) vocalist but what excites me the most is his ability as a composer . These are not just pop songs . Why not ? His emotional depth ( through music ) , melody , harmonic adventures and sophisticatedaccompaniment are those of a classical composer . Not just a one trick pony either . I like to think that Rufus was channelling some of these fellows on this album ... . '' Do I disappoint you '' : A swirling , decadent Szymanowskian splurge , complete with hints of Eastern mysticism and erotic dissonance.Going to a town : One of those perfect Mozart concerto middle movements where time stands still . When was the last time you heard a sequence of fourths used with such elegance and poignancy ? Tiergarten : It 's not just the German title . The sprightly , slightly odd accompaniment creates the perfect depiction of a garden stroll , while the vocal melody lets us know that deeper stuff is going on ... ... ... .Pure Schubert Lied.Nobody 's off the hook : Oh so Brahms . A folk like melody based on thirds which grows and surges to an exquisite climax , although the sense of longing is never satisfied , just a wistful acceptance . If that is not enough for you , it is accompanied by a piano quintet ... ... Hello ! ! Between my Legs : What a corker . While the opening somehow reminds me of Fleetwood Mac , the song soon takes on the characteristics and irresistible energy of a Verdi cabeletta ( `` when the rocket ships explode ... '' ) . The coda section suddenly switches over to a Richard Strauss extended climax ( as we all know , the longer the better ) .Rules and Regulations : This one is a bit hard . I am very tempted to say a Britten/Auden cabaret song , but am I just being too much persuaded by the boys ' school eroticism of the film clip ? Mind you there is the witty text and rhymes and the badly played recorder like we hear in Britten 's Noye 's Fludde ... ..Not ready to Love : Ravel . Not the busy whirly Ravel but the minimalisty piano concerto second movement Ravel.Slide Show : This one is hard . There are elements of Schumann- the delicacy of the melody and the emotion , the soaring phrases ( which are also a little bit Leonora from Il Trovatre do n't you think ? ) and the melancholy play out . But what about the crazy Bruckner brass burst ? Tulsa : A mad Piazzolla/Mahler mix.Leaving for Paris : Very Satie . Does n't go anywhere , but if you are in the mood it 's a nice journey anywhere . Actually , I enjoy it far more than Satie but you get my drift.San souci : It 's not really very classical is it ? However is there not a hint of Zanzibar from Poulenc 's Les Mamelles des Tiresias ? Release the Stars : I would be certainly stretching the point with this one , but 11 out of 12 is n't bad.The single quality I love about this man 's music is his ability to achieve moving emotional catharsis through harmonic resolution . Who else has done this in living memoryso consistently ? Buy it , love him and get excited about his upcoming opera .	1
From the moment I heard the first track on `` Release the Stars '' my first thought was that this album was going to be overly-dramatic , very operatic . My intial thoughts on this album was correct ; but I do n't mean this in a negative way , Rufus Wainwright is one of the few people that can pull it off wonderfully . My favorite songs are `` Do I Disappoint You '' , `` Going to a Town '' , `` Between My Legs '' , `` Tiergarten '' , `` Tulsa '' , and `` Slideshow '' the latter of them in which is the most overally dramatic all . Overall I love this album and will be looking forward to reviewing some of his earlier works such as the Wants and Poses .	1
`` Release the Stars '' is Rufus Wainwright at the top of his game . I did n't think he could top the peaks he hit in Want 1 and 2 , but this is his most powerful collection yet . However , if you do n't know Rufus , this is n't the place to start . Start with `` Poses , '' and work your way up to this one . If you do n't like his style -- baroque , bombastic , over-the-top music and emotion , lousy diction that drives some people out of the room -- this album wo n't change your mind.His fifth album , and he is n't repeating himself yet -- while it 's all obviously Rufus , nothing on this album sounds like a specific reworking of previous songs ; and in `` Going to a Town '' he gets political for the first time -- a song not about himself ! What a concept ! I still have difficulty with his words ; they 're not lyrics exactly , they 're more rhythmic prose speeches put to music , and most of them are so esoteric as to defy a clear understanding of his imagery.But the music -- wow . Gorgeous . Melody and rhythm like no one else is writing today , and the orchestrations by a number of people are lush and dense . I try to find comparisons in the contemporary world and the classical world , and ca n't . Rufus Wainwright is in a class by himself .	1
Complex interesting work never boring , at times a bit offensive . Going to A Town stopped me dead in my tracks . I felt the bristle of reactionary nationalism with the lyrics , '' I 'm so tired of you , America '' . Then I realized I myself sometimes feel that way , too . It 's not a put down of the US , it 's just a statement of fact . If you 've ever thrown your hands up into the air and wondered why things are the way they are sometimes , then you know what is meant . Art is suppose to evoke emotion , this one certainly does . `` Sanssouci '' was another gottcha ' . A song about two gay friends , one decides to go into the Nazi pleasure S & M castle ( drug scene ) and never be heard of again and the other shakes his head in bewilderment and walks on . Torn between the left and the right , like that song Berlin/Peter Schilling . This one makes you feel uncomfortabe yet it needed to be said ; even now we ( LGBT movement ) are still in an identity crisis politically . The whole atmosphere of the album is fun to listen to : you know that there is a thing of value in your cd player . Enough said , good job Rufus Wainwright !	1
Release The Stars defied my expectations - my first impression was that it would be difficult to enjoy as much as his previous albums - and yet , after a few progressively more attentive listening sessions , I am convinced that this is at least on par with his best ( and that is a huge acheivement ) .Release The Stars is another great adventure in the art of musical performance , arrangement and production - and in the fine art of lyrical expression.It is good to hear Rufus say that he 's found bliss in a long term relationship ( 2 years and counting ) . I wish them many joy-filled , creative and mutually rewarding years together .	1
What more can you ask for ? Seriously , beautiful , soulful voice , poetic lyrics and gorgeous melody . Rufus once again proved he is one of those rare geniuses of his generation . I so hope this album will get him the commercial success he so deserves .	1
I saw Rufus last night at the Hollywood Bowl , recreating Judy Garland 's famous Carnegie Hall concert . Not only is he a GREAT singer/songwriter of every style , he has become a remarkable showman . I would kill to have a video of what I saw last night . Release the Stars is a fine sample of the range and depth of his styles of songwriting , from the right on 'Going To a Town ' to the really upbeat , pop showtune style songs . Rufus has been comissioned to write an opera for the Metropolitan Opera , and I have no doubt he will dazzle in this medium as well .	1
It was great seeing some of these videos again and some never seen . Loads of fun here !	1

To me , this group sounds a lot like Porcupine Tree - which is definitely not a bad thing ! This album is totally excellent ! Since adding it to my collection a couple of months ago , it has become one of my favorites.I ca n't recommend this highly enough to anyone that likes Porcupine Tree . And , if you have n't heard the music of Porcupine Tree , then check them out too !	1
`` Selling Insincerity '' is definately the best progressive rock debut album since Riverside 's `` Out Of Myself '' , and one of the best of the year 's releases period.Combining elements of rock , '70s prog , and modern alternative metal , this band owes a huge debt to Porcupine Tree , but they are obviously aware of this influence , and manage to move beyond mere homage or copycatting and create their own sound without being too derivative . Subdued , acoustic interludes and textured atmospherics alternated with heavy , distorted riffs build into huge crescendoes of sound and motion . Superb musicianship abounds on this album , as well as excellent production values and songwriting , which is quite impressive for a band 's debut album ... thought-provoking , melancholy lyrics and arrangements reminiscent of the aforementioned band as well as Opeth , Katatonia and Tool . Highly recommended ; definately on my top-ten list this year !	1
Selling Insincerity is the debut album of Abigail 's Ghost , a young American band formed around the nucleus of guitarist and vocalist Joshua Theriot and bassist Kenneth Wilson . Though the band avoids categorization , their style of music mostly falls into progressive rock that emphasizes a blend of groove , spacey atmospheres , and excellent vocal harmonies.This is a self-released effort , drawing from a vast library of influences including Porcupine Tree , A Perfect Circle , Tool , Massive Attack , and Rush . The low bass drones of the album opener `` Mazurka '' lead into the rhythmically aware `` Close '' , which immediately stands out for its Porcupine Tree-like vocal arrangement , sparse drum beats , and bleak synth lines . The chorus of the song is incredibly memorable , and helps thicken the already dense soundscape . You can hear lots of weird sound collections in the background if you listen with a good set of headphones . The song breaks down into a creepy middle section filled with cold acoustic guitars capped by powerful bass strokes and distant keyboards.Joshua Theriot employs a similar vocal recording technique to Steven Wilson ; he utilises the same processed vocal style and laidback singing whilst continuously exerting a melodious delivery . His vocal melodies on songs like `` Waiting Room '' and `` Seeping '' are amazing . Though most will be reminded of Steven Wilson when hearing him sing , Theriot cites Chris Corner of IAMX and Sneaker Pimps as his main influence . He is also an excellent guitar player , adding varied guitar sounds to the compositions . He can go from elegiac lead playing on `` Monochrome '' to atonal expressions on `` Love Sounds '' and `` Cerulean Blue '' , both of which boast a Belew-like tone and articulation.Kenneth Wilson 's backing vocals and bass are equally important to the success of these songs . Not only is he a gifted songwriter , he is also an excellent producer given the duo 's limited resources when recording this album . If it were n't for the amazing production , there is no way these songs would sound as good as they do . Wilson 's bass playing is particularly central on `` Cerulean Blue '' , complete with industrial-like beats , eerie sounds , and manipulated vocal parts . The mix on this song is phenomenal , blowing the listener away with killer right-left speaker panning.The other members ' performance is awesome as well . The studio drummer did a great job , as he exerts both classic 4/4 beats and complex polyrhythms depending on the flow of the song ( he is now replaced by permanent member John Patrick Rodrigue ) . They have also enlisted a second guitar player since they cut the record : Randy Paul . However , Joshua Theriot 's guitar work is solid through and through with crunchy rhythms and excellent leads . Theriot has also recorded some synths along with keyboardist Brett Guillory who brings in Barbieri-like synth textures in order to reach necessary atmospheres.The lyrics are thought-provoking and match the incredible artwork perfectly . The image on the front cover gives a sense of separation while the baby doll lying on the ground in the foreground has ties to themes of abandonment , which is explored on the album . Also , `` Sellout '' could be read as a nod to Porcupine Tree 's `` The Sound of Muzak '' , but it is also about compromising oneself . The band is n't that keen on talking about their lyrics as they believe it might defeat the purpose of extrapolating one 's own meaning.Fans who enjoy progressive music that marries the hallmarks of Porcupine Tree 's modern-sounding material with the harmonies of Cure and A Perfect Circle should check this disc out . Selling Insincerity is one of the best debuts of the year along with Thought Chamber 's Angular Perceptions and John Macaluso & Union Radio 's The Radio Waves Goodbye .	1
Of Roy Wood 's solo albums , this is the most listenable , yet still contains significant innovations to keep the casual listeners ' attention . The best example is 'Wake Up ' , a song in which he is swimming to meet his lover . Percussion for the song is played in pails of water , filled to different levels to enable Wood to give the image of swimming as the drum sticks splash in the water , while simultaneously playing the percussion AND melody . The variety of instruments Wood plays is , in itself , astounding . Worth picking up !	1
Roy Wood 's first solo album was basically a one man show . He played all instruments on his own compositions . Mixture of ballads and rockers . The 2 things that impress me is the strength & diversity of the songs & Roy 's amazing pitch perfect voice . Roy has always been one of the unheard of polymaths of music . Maybe one day people will start to listen .	1
Yes - the music is MAGIC ! I bought it on vinyl in 1973 , the day it was released , and was blown away . Mr. Wood is a creative genius bar none . All of the music is such an obvious labour of love . Few CD 's make me feel as happy as this . The music has so much melody and is very sweet and lovely . The sound quality on the new CD is subjective . I prefer the mix and sound of the LP . I was lucky to find a brand new LP on the web a few years ago and transferred the LP to CD . I listened to the CD and LP/CD with a good set of headphones . I prefer the mix , sound quality , stereo seperation etc . of the LP . The CD is VERY good , do n't misunderstand . I 've been listening to this music for so long as an LP , I think my ears have been trained to hear it a certain way . This CD has everything , a creative genius at his peak . a true musical gem .	1
Roy Wood 's `` Boulders '' recorded in 1970 and released in 1973 , is one of Roy 's top records . ( others include `` Wizzard Brew '' , `` Mustard '' and `` On The Road Again '' ) . Here Roy plays all the instruments on this record except for John Kurlander who plays Harmonium on `` Songs Of Praise '' . Alan Parsons was one of the engineers on the album . This is a smorgasbord of musical idea 's ! Classic all the way around , every ELO and Move fan should own this CD . `` Boulders hit # 176 in America a real accomplishment since no Move album ever hit the Top 200 , and the first ELO hit only # 196.Here are the highlights : '' Songs Of Praise '' - One of my favorites . Roy goes gospel here , uplifting and a bouncy tune . `` Wake Up '' - Gentle tune , acoustic guitar and recorder . Water splashes very good sound effects . `` Rock Down Low '' - 50 's Roy here , kind of like Eddy And The Falcons he started in 1974 . Great Sax work and Piano . Love the Cello solo . `` Nancy Sing Me A Song '' - Very 60 's sounding . `` Nancy , Nancy sing me a song , something too make my hair grow long '' . `` Dear Elaine '' - A Top 20 hit , a strange choice for a single but it 's just pure Roy Wood ! Classic . A very delicate number . `` All The Way Over The Hill '' and `` Irish Loafer ( And His Hen ) - More Doo Wop here , a lovely song with Beach Boy type medleys . Great sitar and recorder . `` Irish Loafer '' this part sounds so early ELO . `` Miss Clarke And The Computer '' - What a song , writting 40 years ago , it 's just amazing what Roy was thinking about back then . ( a gentle jazz piece in the middle of the song ) . Excellent song ! `` When Gran'ma Plays The Banjo '' - Another one of my all-time classics ! Released as a single , but failed . ( SHOCK ) .Just a fun song . Roy picks the banjo with gusto , love the crowd reactions on this song . `` Rock Medley '' ( A ) `` Rockin ' Shoes '' - Elvis sounding . ( B ) - '' She 's Too Good For Me '' - Everly Brothers sounding too my ears . ( C ) `` Locomotive '' - Eddy and the Falcons here , great guitar and sax.Just a joyous record all the way thru . `` Wizzard Brew '' would be next for Roy .	1
Roy Wood 's eccentric , creative approach to music made him a bit hard to characterize which is probably why he never found an appreciative audience in the United States . The remaster sounds decent ... it could sound better without the wonky E.Q . and the overuse of noise reduction but since the previously released version is n't readily avaiable , this is probably the best edition you can get . I ca n't recommend Peter Mew 's overuse of No Noise for this album but the great music on it manages to transcend most of the issues with the mastering . Some people will find this difficult to listen to others wo n't mind it . It really depends on your ear and your system . Five stars for the album ... 2 stars for the mastering.It 's too bad this album did n't find an appreciative audience because `` Boulders '' is a masterpiece . Covering everything from his unique version of `` gospel '' ( `` Songs of Praise '' ) to folk ballads tinged with psychedelia , Wood 's music was always unique and demanding of his audience . The founder of The Move and co-founder of ELO with Jeff Lynne ( Wood left due to creative differences during the recording of ELO 's second album ) . Goofy , fun , delightfully creative and charming ( in a good way ) '' Boulders '' remains , along with `` Mustard '' , Wood 's masterpiece . Wood plays every instrument here ( except one ) and does all the vocals himself . Wood takes unexpected twists and turns from using the sound of slapped water as percussion to the humorous `` When Gran'ma Plays the Banjo '' where Wood plays the banjo impersonating the Gran'ma of the title and other**less talented**players.The booklet has the song lyrics and an appreciation of sorts by Wood himself discussing the album . We only get a single bonus track an early rough mix of `` Dear Elaine '' but the album would have been welcome without anything extra . It 's that good.Recorded in 1969 while Wood was still leading The Move and before he formed ELO with Lynne , the album was held three years after its completion so as not to conflict with Wood 's other output . It 's a pity because if this had been released in 1970 instead of 1973 I do n't doubt that Wood 's unique , stylizied delivery would have found an audience . He manages to take his hook filled music and twist it in ways only his peers and influences could have.If you 've heard `` California Man '' you 'll have an idea of the `` sound '' of the album . The last Move album sounds a lot like `` Boulders '' . Wood 's sound and approach wo n't be for everyone and anyone listening to this because of Wood 's brief affilation with ELO will be surprised because this sounds NOTHING like what Jeff Lynne later did with that band . Highly recommended .	1
Years after Metallica lost all credibility and become a parody of themselves , Megadeth keeps on rocking and delivering some of the finest metal out there.Lyrically , this is perhaps the best record . Musically , it 's almost in the same league as Rust In Peace and Killing Is My Business ... For any fan of Megadeth or metal in general , it 's an obvious must have .	1
Often we talk about the `` First Four '' Megadeth albums ( possibly adding CTE as the `` First Five '' ) as the golden age of Megadeth . Beyond that , there is a wide range of fan opinion on the various releases , but little universal acclaim for any one individual effort . I say this because UA I believe belongs in the same league as the classic albums . There is nothing weak on this album . One could argue that Set Me Free ( A Tout Le Monde remade ) does n't fit , but Dave has made it clear this was added by the record company execs . And it 's a good song anyway . But for pure thrash and controlled anger , UA is more than solid . The title track , Gears of War , Sleepwalker , and Washington is Next stand out for me . This belongs in the collection of any Megadeth fan or Metal aficionado .	1
I did n't much care for the last few MegaDeth albums , but this one has reignited my appreciation for their music . In a sense faster and leaner than recent offerings , I enjoyed this album quite a bit .	1
Are you kidding me ? This CD is ridiculously good . A return to form for arguably the best band ever in the metal genre . Dave 's lyrics are brilliant and the guitar work is phenomenal.I 'll leave the long reviews for others and leave it at this : If you are a Megadeth fan , you must own this CD .	1
This album is non stop heavy crunching metal . From the first song to the last , this album shreds . One of Megadeth 's best albums by far ! ! The guitar work explodes right off the cd . Guitar solos abound and Mustaine 's voice is perfectly blended with the music . The mix is so clean that you can hear each instrument clearly.This is metal at its best . This album is what Metallica 's St. Anger should 've been .	1
After taking a break from Megadeth for some time now , I now gave their eleventh studio album . United Abominations was a reminder of why I love this band . Even if the songs deal with politics and such , the definitive sounds of thrash are such an exhilarating experience . With this album , Dave Mustaine has mustered a brand new lineup . You might expect it to sound different ( like how Risk sounded different ) , but it 's almost straight-up old-school . It 's the classic Megadeth sound from the early years , with an added modern touch . Songs like `` Sleepwalker , '' `` Washington is Next ! '' and `` Gears of War '' are sure to win the hearts of longtime Megadeth fans . The new version of `` A Tout Le Monde '' with Christina Scabbia is outstanding , though I still prefer the original . The only problem I have with this album is that it tends to sound slightly repetitive as we get to the last few songs . But overall , this is still a great album.Grade : 8.9 out of 10Also from MegadethSo Far , So Good ... So What ! ( 8.1 out of 10 ) Rust in Peace ( 9.3 out of 10 ) Countdown to Extinction ( 9.4 out of 10 ) Youthanasia ( 9.9 out of 10 ) Cryptic Writings ( 9.4 out of 10 ) Risk ( 8.2 out of 10 ) The World Needs a Hero ( 8.9 out of 10 ) The System has Failed ( 8.2 out of 10 )	1
Definitely a return to form . Megadeth in my opinion has been fairly consistant with what Dave Mustaine writes . The recent Album offers the listener what Megadeth should sound like 25+ plus years since Dave has been in the business . Smart , and witty lyrics , heavy guitar riffs and ripping guitar solos reminicent of 80 's style . Each song has it various qualities , all excellent . Highly recommended .	1
I was delighted with The System has Failed which was a step in the right direction musically in my opinion , it might have been a little more Youthanasia than Peace Sells but the important point is that the songs were great , the production was punchy again after three flat sounding records , and Dave sounded angry for the first time in years.United Abominations , takes that ball and runs with it , coming across very much as a thrashier , harder and faster version of The System Has Failed . The great thing however , is that even if you forgot that a subgenre called thrash had ever existed , this would still be an absolutely phenomenal record.There are no weak tracks , the guitar solos are good , the production job is good and the album feels more like a cohesive band effort than the previous record did.While the album thankfully got the praise it got , some people remained suspicious . There have been a fair amount of criticisms made on some fairly petty things . So on the album artwork , skeletal-mascot Vic has skin ? So the band re-recorded their classic track ` A Toute Le Monde , ' ? So What ? it was a great song then , and its still the same song , and who really cares about the mascot on the artwork when the music is so great.If you enjoy the music of Megadeth , are n't stuck in the past , can overlook those petty flaws and if you can get over the lyrics then you will surely love United Abominations . Peace Sells , but Buy this instead .	1
I would have to say that overall I consider United Abominations a good album but not great . I love the fact that Mustaine is making a serious effort to return to his 80 's thrash roots . For the most part the album is pure heavy metal and avoids the progressive sound they had from the mid to late 90's.There are numerous strengths for this album . The production is great and the band plays suprisingly tight for not having been together long . Glen Drover is a fantastic lead guitarist . Shawn Drover is no Gar Samuelson or Nick Menza , but he holds his own well enough on drums . There are no really bad songs on this album and the remake of A Toute Le Monde is surprisingly good ... normally I do n't like those lightweight songs but that one has really grown on me.There are not many weaknesses to this album but they should be noted . I would say one of the main weaknesses to me is a lack of a `` classic '' track , such as Peace Sells or Hangar 18 . There are some very good songs on this album such as Sleepwalker and Gears of War but I would not put those songs in the same category as My Last Words or Tornado of Souls . Also , there is a lack of very speedy songs . Most songs are heavy , but the album is mostly mid-paced . I am a fan of the 80 's Deth sound so sometimes I want them to really go balls out but it usually does not happen here . Another problem is that the album is a little too political , even by Mustaine 's standards . Some of these songs are too centered around current events and will probably sound dated in ten years . When he does political songs it would be smarter to keep them more abstract , such as Peace Sells or Holy Wars.I do not want to sound too negative though , this is a strong album , some of the best metal to come out this year . United Abominations is Mustaine 's true comeback , NOT The System Has Failed.Highlights : Sleepwalker , Washington is Next ! , Never Walk Alone , Gears of War , A Toute Le Monde , You 're Dead ! Lowlights : Blessed Are the Dead , Play For Blood , Amerikhastan	1
People always gripe and compare new music to an artists past releases , and while that should put you on track with WHO they are , it should not be a negative thing . If Megadeth produced every CD just like Countdown-they would get tagged with doing the same old thing . On this CD , Dave and Co. amp things up like they would have in the old days with some maturity added in . At first listen , I didnt know what to expect but after about 1 min into Sleepwalker ... I knew what I was in for . It 's the best Metal cd to come out this year by far . Metallica should take note of this cd and use Dave a model if they hope to even come CLOSE to the intensity of this CD . UP THE IRONS ! ! !	1
I have n't been a fan of Megadeth very long I first got into the band back in my army days , my roommate played way to much Metallica and I wanted something heavy but not Metallica . I discovered Megadeth . One of the best finds for me , been a fan ever since . This cd is cool I liked the song with Christina Scabbia .Cd came quickly and in good condition .	1
Hey folks , I am writing this from the desert of Iraq . In 2004-2005 I was in Iraq on my first tour and I bought The System has Failed at the PX . Yesterday United Aboninations finally became available at the PX on Al Asad . Of course I grabbed it , barely looking at the album cover.Well I see that Vic Rattlehead has had an upgrade of sorts . Instead of a skeleton , he now resembles a lobotomized human . Pretty cool I guess.I 've been listening to this album for two days straight and I have to admit it took a little while to grow on me . That 's how it is with me and Megadeth . For me there are two types of Megadeth albums , the first type is the one that grabs you by the throat and you love the album at first listen . For me that would be the first three albums and The System has Failed . Then there are the other types where it takes me a while to get into . Those for me were the 90 's albums , and it seems United Abominations.If you are a Megadeth fan , you have to be a Dave Mustaine fan . Let 's face it Dave IS Megadeth , Dave IS Vic Rattlehead . Junior is long gone folks . Love him or hate him , Dave deserves respect for all he has done for metal . His contributions are enormous . I am a guitar player and guitar freak anyway , so when I buy or listen to a Megadeth album , to me it 's all about the guitar work . This is what Dave does best , his singing is secondary . Dave does NOT disappoint on United Abominations . His chops , riffs , and solos are as top notch as ever . He still dominates the fretboard . So there was no disappointment there.Dave 's voice is the same as it has always been . Great singer ? No . But he never was anyway . Dave 's voice is just a tool to deliver the message , that 's it . This album is chock full of warfare , corruption , and the Apocalypse ( it 's Megadeth , what did you expect ? ) . I really dig the vibe and atmosphere on the song `` Blessed are the Dead '' as he presented his vision of the Four Horsemen.I do like this album . But after you listen to it , no songs really stand out . You listen to the whole album and remember very little of it . There is just no big impact . With The System has Failed I could stand in line at the chowhall and sing 'Kick the Chair ' to myself , but United Abominations has no anthems so to speak.Again I 've only had this album for two days , but I can already tell that this album will take time to grow on me . I 'll probably appreciate it more if I can find some guitar tabulature for it . And one more thing , thank God Dave is still carrying the torch of REAL metal . This IS a REAL metal album . It is not fair , but Megadeth released a decent album on Roadrunner records and it will probably sell 200,000 units worldwide . Meanwhile Metallica is getting ready to release another abortion of an album this year that sheep will buy and it will go platinum , go figure . But most metalheads see that Metallica can not compete with Megadeth anymore . Metallica ruled the 80 's , but life is a marathon , and Megadeth is WAY out in front while Metallica is deciding on how to record St. Anger II without a therapist .	1
I 've been waiting for this album to come out since about 2 months ago . I 've been counting down days to go and buy this album . The very first thing I did today was rush over to the record store and pick this up . I was pretty amazed at how mindblowingly good this was . Despite that is the 21st century , Megadeth still remained heavy as hell on their new album . this is amazing . `` Sleepwalkers '' was a great opener . `` Washington is next '' is an awesome politically inspired song that rocks real hard . All the following songs pretty much ruled . I did n't have to skip one track . It was one heavy , hard metalfest from beginning to end . If anyone is unsure about this album thinking Megadeth might have softened up , you are dead wrong . Get this album ! The political songs were amazing too with incredible lyrics . Buy , buy , buy .	1
I like this one better than `` The System Has Failed '' , which is also very good . This one is excellent ! 5 stars without reservation !	1
I do n't quite understand why the star average of UA is only 4 stars and the preceding and following recordings get 4.5 stars ? ? ? ! ! ! This album has good killer riffs and some serious shredding and about all are mid-tempo to fast . It 's too bad that for guitar solos they ca n't do it tunefully like IRON MAIDEN or BLACK SABBATH but instead it 's just a lot of shredding but that 's just something you have to get used to . I think this is the best offering they 've had since about YOUTHANASIA ( that 's a good bit of time ) . None of the songs are overly long ( everything is under 6:00 ) which is pretty nice ( I like long songs by some bands but not really from this band ) ! ! ! I think that this one may be 3rd place in their entire discography behind COUNTDOWN TO EXTINCTION and YOUTHANASIA but it could eventually be my second favorite after CTE . I 'm not really sure why this only has a 4 star average when it should be at least a 4.5 ! ! ! ! I would just tell amazon customers to give UA a chance and you 'll really love it ! ! ! ! ! I 'm out ! ! ! ! ! ! ! P.S . Forgot to mention that 's this has about the best sound quality they 've ever got from a studio album ! ! ! The other great sounding recording was COUNTDOWN TO EXTINCTION way back in 1992 or thereabouts .	1
2nd disc since Dave Ellefson left the band and Mr. Mustaine seems to want to back in time musically and blend it with it with bits of the present . And I like it ! ! I also like Dave E 's F5 project although it sounds a lot like Sevendust but that 's OK cause I like them too . It cracks me up to read the hater reviews . If you 're a true Megadeth fan you roll with the changes in their music . At least their not turning their hat sideways and screaming Yo , Yo , Yo , Look At Me ! Instead they 're still giving you rocking tunes with scorching solos . Do you get that from Lympsync Bizketstreet Boys or Puddle Of Poop ? The fact is that eventhough being pushed aside by the crap that MTV has the kiddies buying the Metal bands from the 80 's and 90 's are still bringing it !	1
If Megadeth was thrown into a cauldron with vintage 80 's Iron Maiden and King Diamond ( particularly `` Abigail '' ) , it would sound like `` United Abominations . '' There is a huge European metal sound on this record ( loads of twin lead guitars , a zillion musical time changes ) that can be partially attributed to Glen Drover joining the band ( he 's a former King Diamond guitarist . ) Megadeth has always had elements of that in their music , but rarely this dedicated over an entire album.Adding to this sound is Drover 's brother Shawn on drums . He plays with Neil Peart-precision and bulldozer power , providing serious musical muscle . Production-wise , It 's their best-sounding studio release by far.That 's not to take away from any of the previous Megadeth lineups , but in the past they had a jazzier , breezier sound which was unique , but not always heavy . `` Abominations '' is just full-on complex Euro-thrash without the glass-shattering banshee vocals.Unlike many recent Megadeth records ( which I like ) `` Abominations '' is beautifully inaccessible . You need to listen to it several times before it truly sinks in , but it rewards a patient ear.The lyrics and themes on this disc are mostly about today 's politically chaotic mess of a planet , which I think brings the best out in Dave . He 's a genius when he 's angry and focused . Many of his legendary songs are current events-related ( `` Holy Wars '' , `` Symphony of Destruction '' and `` Set The World Afire '' to name a few . ) `` Abominations '' fits right into that club.It does quiet down a bit for the remake of `` A Tout le Monde '' ( a duet with Lacuna Coil 's Cristina Scabbia ) but the rest sounds like truckload of 2x4s being fed into a giant table saw . `` Sleepwalker '' , `` Washington is Next ! `` , and `` Never Walk Alone ... A Call to Arms '' , is as powerful an album-opening 1-2-3 punch as any in the band 's catalog.This is n't just a return to form for Megadeth , it 's something heavier with a great big nod to the classic Euro-metal bands of the 80 's .	1
Megadeth continue their return to form started with THE SYSTEM HAS FAILED . the 2nd trilogy is worth owning , THE SYSTEM HAS FAILED , UNITED ABOMINATIONS and ENDGAME.Sounds like a return to the glory days for Mr. Mustaine and co. Every single one of these tracks are killer , and the production expertise of Andy Sneap certainly help !	1
Dave 's great . Megadeth has been far more consistant than Metallica , even including Megadeth 's experimental CD 's ... ... at least they are still metal . Good old school return for Megadeth , even if some of the riffs are a bit familiar . Dave really deserves more credit than he gets for influencing young bands . Even bands like Machinehead and Skinlab owe alot to the mighty Megadeth 's early influences . Speaking of Skinlab , check out their new live CD as one reviewer mentioned ... .I heard some songs and it 's probably the heaviest live recording ever made . I was blown away . SkinnedAlive is what it 's called , so check it out	1
United abominations is one of the best thrash albums.this super album features some terrific songs like sleep walker , washington is next , the title track and gears of war.this album is awesome and is highly recommended .	1
I 've loved EVERY album MD has put out ( even Risk ) , but I had been a bit dismayed that their signature early sound had been lost for so long . This new album brings it all back ! I can not stop listening to this album ! I feel like a teen again back in '80s . A MUST have for any true Megadeth fan ! God bless Mustaine and Vic !	1
In my opinion Megadeth 's 2nd best album after `` Rust in Peace '' . Metal at it 's best . They pull the strings hard in this one . You wo n't be disappointed with this one .	1
DCT does NOT disappoint ! This was incredibly well put together and reflects the overall vocal strength of DCT that still maintains . I would highly recommend this and a must see . There is also extras for selection that has a great interview of the start of his career and his rise through BS & Ts . ; Enjoy this treasure while you can !	1
If you liked Blood Sweat and Tears , you 've hear his voice . David Clayton Thomas is older in this video , but he is an entertainer . It has become a favorite video of mine . The seller is very good too !	1
George Duke talks about learning from Frank , recording with Frank , and having his perspectives broadened by Frank 's challenges.1973 recording-studio footage is included . ( Where 's the rest , please ? ) And ... Ruth Underwood plays the vibes for you . In her den.In fact , she plays an excerpt from an unreleased Zappa score.Wow . BUY THE DVD . Turn off the repulsive tripe coming from your little hit radio station and learn about how the real folks did it ; do something aesthetically kind for yourself , for a change .	1
This documentary gave me a really good appreciation of the music on 'Over-Nite Sensation ' ( I was already a a huge fan of the 'Apostrophe ( ' ) ' album ) ! The video clips were fantastic as well ... I recommend this documentary to anybody looking to get into Zappa 's best work .	1
More should have been spent on the testimonies of other surviving members of the Mothers of Invention - I am not sure the actual name of this band is even mentionned once ! - or at least of the few that made it in the final script or accepted to be part of it . Long time Zappa wizes like George Duke and Ian Underwood must have had tons of insights to share on the learning , arranging and performing of this music , yet so little remains here . ( Who IS this guy with the cap ! ? ) Luckily , we have Ruth Komanoff 's brilliant and slightly didactive demonstration of her tuned percussion skills , love of Zappa 's music and wildly amusing account of how her marimba came to be electrically amplified . Zappa 's elder son Dweezil comments at the mixing board about the master tapes , and this is also very precious and quite revealing , especially for those who think these are merely `` joke albums '' .Neither on Apostrophe nor Over-Nite is there a single song related to groupies ( had it been `` Fillmore East June '71 '' and `` 200 Motels '' , it would have been different ) , and Zappa had said before in interviews that `` Dina-Moh Hum '' is a fictitious tale . But the steamy ditty is taken as pretext to stray off towards tabloid-type nurishment for too long in such a short program . And they should have also take the time to explain who the character in `` I 'm The Slime '' really is , for those who ca n't read.But a very good documentary all in all , if not at premium cost .	1
I have always loved this material . It is among the select group of recordings I listen to over & over .	1
I thoroughly enjoyed these DVD 's , as Santana is actually playing more spiritual music with great Jazz musicians . I especially liked Ravi Coltrane 's interpretation of Pharaoh Sanders ' beautiful classic `` Light from the Edge of the World . '' In fact , Coltrane outshines Shorter in freshness of his solos on tenor sax ( Shorter 's tenor sax acoustic pick up leaves a lot to be desired - a technical problem which is common to all the other Santana + Shorter DVD 's ) . Of course , Ravi Coltrane does not reach the heights and energy that Pharaoh Sanders exudes , but again what living tenor saxist does ? Finally , Salvador Santana performs wonderfully on the piano and I was sorry to see him substituted by Herbie Hanckock after that beautiful introduction he played to Miles ' classic `` In A Silent Way '' ( never been a fan of Herbie 's playing ) .	1
I LOVE these guys ... I listen to them on the local country station , as well as a few CDs . Awesome stuff	1
Country music CD , This is a great CD and Amazon is a great place to purchase them.. Fast , EZ , plus speedy delivery ... Amazon ... You Rock . Janet	1
There are some great stadium-friendly songs , and & # 34 ; Faster Than Angels Fly & # 34 ; is beautiful . Note : there 's not as much weirdness . 5/5 .	1
Linkin Park 's new album , Minutes to Midnight is somewhat a drastic change from their previous two . Of course Hybrid Theory is their best disc but this particular album is n't a total wash-out . The reason I gave Minutes to Midnight four stars is because the band tried something new , which I always appreciate , the songs are softer but still have a rock edge to it , and Chester Bennington 's vocals have never sounded more clearer and animated ( in a good way ) . Standout tracks include : Bleed it Out , Shadow of the Day , Hands Held High , In Between , and Leave Out All the Rest . Expect to hear a different sound but ultimately it will leave you wanting more ( if you like change that is ) . Happy listening !	1
Not one bad song here . Not sure what the 1 , 2 and 3 star reviews are all about . But then again , I am over 40 so maybe `` I just do n't get it '' . All I know is I like it . Or as Forrest would say , `` I like it a lot . ''	1
For some reason , I feel as though I needed to begin the review with that title . I do n't want to falsely give someone the idea that I am reviewing the band 's first two albums.With that said , it upsets me that fans sem to only like aband that stays comfortably within the confines of what a fan sees as good/great music . I personally love it when a band does something that no one expects out of them . And , not only does LP do that , they do it so good they make you forget that you even disliked the new sound.The album itself is not a far departure from the rap/pop/alternative infusion that made the band successfyl . It is the result of what ahppens when a band pushes themselves . I think that the album drips with personality , heart , and emotions.The band does get political , and at times a bit lovestruck . But , what the band does not do is depart entirely from their edge and sharpness . Chester 's voice still pierces the heart , and oozes with emotion . The basslines take hold . Shinoda 's vocals and lyrics take you to where he was when he got the inspiration for the song . It 's a full fledged , heavily worked on album.The only downside is that the album falls short in the productiond epartment . While the lyircs and overall effect of the songs still fills the listener with emotion . The way the album was put together seems a litle haphazard . You finish the album wondering if you got a version that was half finished , or if you burned all the tracks right . Essentially , you are left wanting something more . Not that it 's a bad thing . But , it is the major critique I have for it.in essences , I appluad the band for striving to do something different . And , after listening tot he album a few times ( not 10 , like one reviewer suggests ) and reading the booklet , you get a sense of what LP was trying to accomplish . Now , whether they did that or not is left up to the audience .	1
Perhaps I was a little too harsh when I gave Linkin Park 's last proper album Meteora a two-and-a-half star rating ; I did that because most of the songs did n't stand out to me , at least back then . In fact , I was surprised when they released `` Numb '' and `` Breaking the Habit '' because I forgot those songs were even on there . Anyway , I can tell right away that their latest album Minutes to Midnight is great.A lot of reviewers seem to dislike this album for two reasons : 1 ) there are too many slower songs on here , and 2 ) Mike does n't rap very much on here . For the former , I think reviewer M. Smith said it best when s/he suggested that core fans of the band need to stop living in the past ; I mean , it would be different if the entire album was ballad-y . And it 's not like Chester 's vocals sound any different . For the latter , I kinda wanted to hear Mike rapping a little more too , but then I remembered that that 's not that important because he 's also the rhythm guitarist/keyboardist , so he decided to focus more on THOSE things . If he were a hype man ONLY , it would be a different story.Anyway , lead single `` What I 've Done '' is easily the best song . Also good are `` Leave Out All the Rest '' as well as the romantic three-in-a-row : `` Valentine 's Day '' , `` In Between '' and `` In Pieces '' . And `` Bleed It Out '' is a highlight as well ( especially that Saturday Night Live performance ) , but the only thing about it is , well , it 's the second single off the album , and it sounds a little too much like the second single from their LAST album , `` Faint '' ( but on the positive side , Mike 's rap is a little better on this song than on the former ) .If there are any songs that I can do without , they would be `` Give It Up '' and `` No More Sorrow '' , because they sound too wannabe metal . But despite what LP diehards want you to think , Minutes to Midnight is a quality album worth buying.Anthony Rupert	1
Even though this is alot softer than your usual Linkin Park CD , it has a fresh feeling to it and sounds really nice . Here are the songs breakdown:1 . Wake - A slow intro that really is boring . 3/102 . Given Up - One of the most `` old - sounding '' songs on the CD . Great Chours and Bridge . 9/103 . Leave Out All The Rest - Great ballad that will be a radio hit . Tune is really nice and mellow . 10/104 . Bleed It Out - Another great rock song . Mike 's rapping is fantastic . 10/105 . Shadow of the Day - A slow song , not much in it . Almost no tune , boring lyrics . 6/106 . What I 've Done - A good first single . Kind of softer rock but the vocals are nice . 8/107 . Hands Held High - Mike 's rapping solo . Great tune , powerful lyrics . 10/108 . No More Sorrow - This really sounds like the old albums . 'Nough said . 10/109 . Valentine 's Day - A slow , mellow song . Kinda emo and depressing . 6/1010 . In Between - Unlike most people , this is my favorite song ! Mike 's singing is really good and I like the chours tune . 10/1011 . In Pieces - Chester 's version of In Between . More Lively Tune 10/1012 . Title Too Long - Takes too long to get interesting . 5/10This is a great album but if you 're looking for the old Linkin Park sound you 'll be really , really dissapointed . It 's a good album in it 's own right , and it 's so different it 's hard to classify it a linkin park album	1
I 'm going to start this out by saying , do NOT ! make a final judgments of this record until you 've listened to it a few times all the way through . the first time I listened to this , i was just like a lot of the reviewers and just felt kind of disappointed , but then directly afterwards I listened to it again and got more into it , the 3rd time I started to really enjoy it , the fourth time I found myself singing along to it . In the past five hours I 've listened to this record none stop , and I still can not get enough . I almost made the mistake of reviewing it after only a couple of listens , but in reality , this record needs to grow on you , and once it does , you 'll realize exactly what they were trying to do.This record is for people with open minds and that are willing to accept the fact that they are doing something totally different . You will not find hybrid theory or Meteora in this record . That sound is totally gone , but once you give this record a chance , and it grows on you , you 'll love it just as much or maybe even more then their last records . I can not believe all of the negative reviews I have seen for this record , but I ca n't help but think that its because you have n't given the record enough listens . Before you review this thing , just listen to the record a bunch of times.in my opinion , this record is amazing & it was totally worth the four year wait . There are so many different genres of music in this one little disk that a music freak like me would just totally eat it up . The record goes from metal , to modern rock , to hip-hop , to punk , to ska , and a lot of others . The record is so different but at the same time it still feels like a linkin park record , which is very hard to pull off . i think my only complaints about this record are its too short ( but longer then their other two records ) and it would be nice to have more Mike and Joe on it.stand out tracks imo would be : Given Up , one of the heaviest songs on the record if not the heaviest , and will defiantly satisfied old linkin park fans or people that want their heavy stuff i should say . Leave Out All The Rest , a slower song but Chester 's voice is just amazing in the song and the music is just so relaxing ... this song will grow on you , just give it a few chances . It would make a great single . Bleed It Out , one of the two songs that mike raps on , his rapping skills are amazing , it 's a very upbeat song and would make a great single as well . What I 've Done , you 've heard it , love it or hate it , I 've always loved this song . Hands Held High , a song obviously about the bush administration and if you read the lyrics they actually say some pretty humorous stuff about bush . No More Sorrow , another really heavy song and will make older linkin park fans happy . Valentines Day , great ballad that explodes into a very heavy song and is very emotional and great . Probably a lot of people will be able to relate to it . In Pieces , the song I was looking forward to the most . It has really different drumming , ska/clash-like guitars and also a great guitar solo in it . One of the best songs on the whole record . The Little Things Give You Away , amazing song and has the solo that every linkin park fan has been waiting for and its very beautiful and the whole song is just great.Agree or Disagree , I think this record is amazing and if you give it a few listens I 'm sure you 'll fall in love with it . If not , that sucks and its too bad you do n't like it.Just like Meteora , I 'm dying for their next record already . Hope the next one comes out a little sooner though : Ppeace !	1
softer then previous outings , not bad though . like other LP , still good summer time listening.one thing i do have to say , Track # 4 , definitely , definitely , definitely needs MORE COWBELL ! ! ! !	1
Some people might dislike me for this review but this Linkin Park CD to me is a masterpeice because the band matured lryically.The songs will amaze you if you slowly listen to the lryics Chester and Mike are singing on the songs . I personally loved the song Given up , Shadow of the Day , Hands Held High , Valentine 's Day , and last In Pieces . The whole CD is amazing start to finish if you keep your mind open as you listen . So many people have began bad mouthing this band for the change of path they took some even said this was the album the found God during . I hate to bust people 's bubble 's but the lead singer of Linkin Park Chester as and always thanks God in each and every album they put out as the 1st person he thanks . I have been a fan of Linkin Park from first CD and forever will be a true die hardcore fan of their 's . Those people out there every band has to mature and make new music as their experiences change their lives they live and go along the path 's of lives . So keep that mind open and keep on listening to this band and supporting them.I know I enjoy all types of music and I hope you do too .	1
In few words : if you expect to hear the same LP sound from Hybrid or Meteora , you will be highly dissappointed . Does n't mean that it 's a bad record but it 's like a totally different band , most of the songs are ballads , and some passages you swear you are listening U2.Buy it only if you will dare to erase all the previous paradigms and preconceptions on LP 's sound to start from scratch .	1
I was stoked about this album and listened to it straight through twice in a row . I 'm listening to it now , as a matter of fact.It 's interesting that a lot of reviewers on here make a statement that they are NOT `` narrow-minded '' music lovers , or they respect a band 's right to experiment and go different directions , but then , in the very next sentence , they say this album is nothing like Linkin Park from previous albums , therefore , it 's trash . First , I do n't think that is necessarily true . There is plenty of the old LP here to keep the band grounded , but , personally , I enjoyed the slower tracks because they showed a more mature and developed sound and lyric style . Amazing job ! I loved it and keep it coming LP .	1
I love Linkin Park , I have listened to them since they frist began to make CDs and continue to like their CDs .	1
This is thier best album ever . Every song is awesome . 5 stars . Get this . Linkin park is the best .	1
In fact , if you have actually LISTENED to the whole thing , you 'd see that it 's quite good.Let 's be clear about one thing , okay ? This is not the same Linkin Park who wrote `` One Step Closer '' ( a great song in its own right ) back in 2000 . No longer are these guys screaming `` shut up when I 'm talking to you ! ! ! '' while playing all power chords on the guitar . To listeners , this can be a good or a bad thing ; good to those who expect to see a little change and growth over the years , bad to those who enjoy hearing the same music and lyrics over and over again . Those of you looking for `` Hybrid Theory Part II '' or `` Meteora the Second '' will be very disappointed here . I 'll admit , I love LP 's first two major releases and still listen to them on a regular basis . But `` Minutes to Midnight '' is a horse of an entirely different color.Gone are the days of seamless interplay between Chester 's clean and/or screamed vocals and Mike 's raps in each song . As others before me have said , Chester handles about 80 % of the vocal duties on this album . But is that really such a bad thing ? The man has a phenomenal voice ! Sure , the scratching effects of one Mr. Hahn are almost absent here , but his presence can still be felt in the other electronic sounds pervasive throughout the album . What really impresses me , however , is how much the other three members of the band have stepped it up in regards to their instruments . Guitarist Brad Delson , for the most part , ditches the all-power chord playing that characterized LP 's first 2 albums in favor of something more clean and textured , and he even plays a couple solos ! The power behind Rob Bourdon 's drumming has intensified , particularly evident on `` No More Sorrow . '' And bassist Phoenix ? You can actually HEAR the man playing this time , most clearly on `` Given Up . `` Now I 'll admit , I was rather disappointed at first when I heard the two `` political '' songs on this album , `` Hands Held High '' and `` No More Sorrow , '' both of which clearly are pointed jabs at the Bush administration . The reason for my disappointment is that Linkin Park has made such great music in the past without having to resort to politics , so why start now ? I 'm no fan of Bush or the Iraq war , but I see no need for musicians to bring their views into their songs . ( I know many of you will disagree with me , and that 's fine , but keep your thoughts to yourself . You are n't winning The Battle for the Internets by posting comments on my review . ) That being said , these guys have done this a lot better than most other artists recently have , i.e . The Dixie Chicks and Green Day . LP 's political songs actually have a little thing called `` emotion '' behind them , and they do n't sound whiny or forced . ( See `` Not Ready to Make Nice '' or `` American Idiot '' for examples of this . ) Furthermore , yes , the F-bomb is utilized on three songs on this release ( `` Given Up , '' `` Bleed It Out , '' `` Hands Held High '' ) , and while I am shocked by that it fails to detract from the overall quality of the songs.I 'm now going to delve into a track-by-track review of the album:1 ) `` Wake '' -Just a short instrumental intro , barely a minute long . Perfectly sets the 50/50 `` beautiful '' and `` brutal '' tone of the album.2 ) `` Given Up '' -Linkin Park gone punk rock ? No way , it ca n't work ! But it does , and Chester 's voice is in top form here . The hand claps and jingling keys are unique background sounds , and Phoenix 's bass playing is killer . Also marks the first apperance of the F-bomb on the album.3 ) `` Leave Out All The Rest '' -The first real `` ballad '' on `` Minutes to Midnight , '' but it 's a great one . Chester sings this one beautifully and the lyrics are quite meaningful.4 ) `` Bleed It Out '' -Far and away the most fun song on the album to listen to . This is Mike 's first appearance and he does not disappoint . He proves that he is more talented than about 95 % of mainstream rappers today . Second track with the F-bomb.5 ) `` Shadow of the Day '' -A lot of folks have compared this to the U2 hit `` With or Without You , '' and I can see why . Was the band channeling Bono and Company while writing/recording this one ? Who knows , but it sounds good to me.6 ) `` What I 've Done '' -The album 's first single that you 've no doubt heard countless times on your local radio station ( s ) . Excellent choice for a single , but I personally would have picked `` Bleed It Out . `` 7 ) `` Hands Held High '' -This track is all Mike . Very reminiscent of his Fort Minor side project , but you can still tell it 's LP . I 'd love to hear this one at a live show.8 ) `` No More Sorrow '' -Chester 's turn to get political on us , and boy does he sound angry . And as a couple others have said , this song would n't sound out of place on a Metallica release . Rob 's drumming is extraordinary here.9 ) `` Valentine 's Day '' -Probably the most `` emo '' song on the album , but LP are n't trying to sound like Dashboard Confessional . And thank God for that . Starts out slow but picks up toward the end.10 ) `` In Between '' -Hold on , Mike can sing ? Who knew ? This is probably the slowest and most simple song on the album , but that does n't make it bad by any means.11 ) `` In Pieces '' -This might sound like an odd comparison , but this track reminds me a lot of the song `` 37 mm '' from AFI 's newest release `` Decemberunderground . '' More on my proposed Linkin Park-AFI connection a bit later.12 ) `` The Little Things Give You Away '' -Honestly , I cried the first time I heard this song . It 's that beautiful , and the perfect closer . I never thought LP had it in them to write a song about Hurricane Katrina , but it works.Okay , now onto why I 'm suggesting that Linkin Park and A Fire Inside ( AFI ) are similar . To be sure , they are two very different sounding bands , but they both took critical risks with recent releases that appear to have `` alienated '' many of their `` hardcore fans . '' AFI did it in 2003 with `` Sing The Sorrow '' and even more so with 2006 's `` Decemberunderground . '' These two albums were so dramatically different from anything they 've done previously that much of their `` fanbase '' wrote them off as `` sell-outs '' because they all wanted `` The Art of Drowning Part Deux . '' It is evident to me that the same thing is happening here with Linkin Park . `` Minutes to Midnight '' is unmistakeably different from any previous LP release , and it shows real growth and promise , but apparently there are still a ton of folks out there who are stuck in the year 2000 and are waiting for another song like `` Crawling '' or `` Runaway '' to come out of LP 's repertoire . Their loss I suppose .	1
This has great tracks , so what if its not `` heavy '' as the previous ones . Like it for what it is.Hands Held High is AMAZING .	1
What some reviewers and those critics in the rock music scene have failed to understand with this newest release by the boys of Linkin Park is that the band have reached out and experimented with their sound and possible new directions of their music . Whilst the previous album Meteora was and is always going to be their best work , they have seen that creating a sound that is repetitious and the same would in time kill their fame . Like it or not , things change , people do and so do bands . Without change we would n't have the best that the music industry offers day in and day out . 'Minutes To Midnight ' is a album of shared personal experience on the tour road and their own personal touches . The back artcover of the album simply is astonishing and proves the point that the five are looking out into the ocean , to see what a 'tomorrow ' will bring . True , I will agree with some reviewers that some of the songs in this album sound like ballads . However , I am a fan of lyrics and the lyrics in these songs are meaningful.The songs that are my favourites and are played religiously are 'Shadow Of The Day ' , 'What 've I Done ' , 'In Between ' and 'Bleed It Out ' . I for one have enjoyed the more mellow music of Linkin Park that for me show more of a experimentation and has made me get closer to this band . Sure , you should maybe listen 2 or 3 times to this album before you start appreciating it , as I have.Overall Linkin Park should be applauded for experimenting and letting go with new sounds . Their next album will be that much better for this experimentation .	1
I was among the many who were disappointed by Linkin Park 's new release upon hearing their CD was not composed and arranged in the manner the last two were , especially since the TRANSFORMERS anthem , `` What I 've Done '' , gave everyone the impression that it was exactly that . But , you know what they say about assumptions . Granted , when I listened to the 30 second clips available on Amazon.com I was disappointed.Linkin Park had fallen into the rut that define most Modern Nu-Metal , Progressive , and Hark Rock bands of the mainstream industry popularized by brooding teens , head-bangers , and casual listeners alike ( I honestly still think of this CD in that manner ) . And to top it all off , the decision to include profanity in their lyrics just felt like a major 180 and totally unnecessary in my opinion.Which is not to say I was offended , no , I simply thought Profanity never worked with Linkin Park like it does for RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE -- to name a band who uses profanity in their lyrics -- , especially when they could their point across or entertain the masses without it . Nevertheless , I decided I would not buy `` Minutes to Midnight '' and simply stick with the Ghost of Linkin Park 's past ; I.E. , `` What I 've Done '' and the previous releases . But then I forgot about on important and flawed detail about LP . Their songs are far too short and get boring easily after a hundredth listening.So upon hearing `` Shadow of the Day '' on the radio , I downloaded the CD and gave it a listening to . Sufficed to say , I was surprised by what assaulted my ears . MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT is not as horrible as I thought it would be , I was wrong in thinking I was buying another `` Fallen ( Evanescence ) '' that would forever haunt me as the biggest Musical Purchase Mistake of my life.No , what I found here still sounds like Linkin Park , only this time it lacks the anger of Chester Bennington 's sore-throat screaming , Mr. Hahn 's Scratch-Table and Electronic beats ( with the exception of a couple songs ) , and the constant presence Mike Shinoda 's old school rapping ( with the exception of one or two songs ) . To put simply Chester Bennington tries his hand at singing on a softer level and to his credit , it works in most of the songs on MTM and then sometimes it does n't mesh at all . The songs are softer and carry a more emotional impact ( the underline themes catering on Regret , Loss , and Reflection ) than the first two.And in one track Mike Shinoda attempts to `` sing '' Microphone confession style ( that 's what it reminded me of ) , a song which has very little instrumental , and it does n't suit him . He should stick to Rapping . And ironically , if you listen to this entire CD , `` What I 've Done '' suddenly improves as a song , especially with the way `` Shadow of the Day '' ends and connects the strange Distorted Sound Affect at the beginning of the song . The strength suddenly returns to the song because it is complemented by the others surrounding it . Ironically , I 'm not even sure why this CD got a parental Advisory Warning Label . The F***Bomb is only used a couple of times in two songs if memory serves me right . After that the profanity is hardly existent on the CD . I 'm not even sure what the ruckus was about anymore , aside from over exaggerated reactions.It honestly reminds me of this : [ `` Mothers rally against Barbie with nose piercing or Butterfly tattoo on her leg , back , or stomach ... whichever it was ... '' ] [ Track Listing ] :1 . Wake - 4/52 . Given Up - 4/53 . Leave Out All The Rest - 5/54 . Bleed It Out - 4/55 . Shadow Of The Day - 4/56 . What I 've Done - 5/57 . Hands Held High - 3/58 . No More Sorrow - 3/59 . Valentine 's Day - 4/510 . In Between - 3/511 . In Pieces - 4/512 . The Little Things Give You Away - 5/5Overall , MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT is a great CD from Linkin Park and unfortunately , like TRANSFORMERS - THE ALBUM , it shall forever be looked down upon as `` Disappointing '' because it lacked what people wanted or expected of them ( for TRANSFORMERS , it was the score . The Score , which had yet to come out and thus people sought to degrade the CD and complain like children about the score not being available instead of keeping that venom to themselves . For Linkin Park : The Original Sound of their previous CDs lacking in `` Minutes to Midnight '' ) . I highly Recommend this to anyone who wants to hear something different . -- -- [ A 4 out of 5 ]	1
i have always loved Lincoln Park just the way they were so when i heard that they were comming out with a CD and it had a `` new sound '' i was not very happy but i was very surprised how much i liked the music . i really love the sond Bleed it Out but i guess i have a very wide music range so i still love them .	1
People 's reviews are really disappointing me here . It reminds me of all the people who complain that Korn is n't heavy anymore now that they 're finally making some great ( though overlooked ) albums . Linkin Park is doing the right thing here . They 're trying to leave behind the Nu Metal genre that has pretty much fizzled out . Without this move , they probably would n't be around much longer . Luckily , they did the smart thing and expanded their sound . Does it sound different ? Yes . Is it still Linkin Park ? Yes . I remember reading that Mike would n't be rapping much , and I was disappointed at first . But the album 's depth really makes up for that . The songs sucked me in to the point that I almost forgot about the absence of rapping verses . They 're that good . Sure , there are softer songs . But they 're executed perfectly . Not to mention , the few heavy songs on here are , in my opinion , heavier than anything else the band has done . Finally we get to hear true hard rock songs without that overly produced distorted guitar . We also get to hear acoustic songs on this album . I would also like to say that Mike 's presence is not missing ! He co-produced the album , plays most of the rhythm guitar so that Brad can finally play some lead , contributes 2 great raps , and actually sings one song all on his own ( which he does amazingly , I might add ... kinda reminds me of a deeper version of Ben Gibbard 's voice.. ) Look , if you only like bands like Evanescence , Breaking Benjamin , etc etc ( Do n't get me wrong , I love those bands ) then this album probably is n't for you . But if you have a diverse music taste or can adapt to change for a good cause ( LP surviving the test of time ) , then pick this up while it 's still cheap .	1
I give this CD five stars because it deserves it . It 's not as good as the first two becuase of a couple reasons . Mike Shinoda 's rap is minimal at best , and the songs are politic heavy , and there 's swearing , but there 's something brewing here that makes me give this CD a five.It 's brilliant . It 's different and it 's interesting . Although the songs are less satisfying than their other releases , it 's the nature of these songs that makes this a 5 star release for me.WakeGiven Up 4/5Leave Out All the Rest 3.5/5Bleed It Out 4.5/5Shadow of the Day 4/5What I 've Done 5/5Hands Held High 5/5No More Sorrow 5/5Valentine 's Day 4/5In Between 5/5In Pieces 3.5/5The Little Things That Give You Away 5/5 *Personal favoriteIt 's not for everybody and may even alienate most Linkin Park fans , but it still gets a definite recommendation from me .	1
A lot of people hate this group , obviously named Linkin Park , now for evolving from a nu-metal band , to an alternative band , and later a band who experiments on their sound . Too bad those people are idiots who are narrow minded and ca n't stand when a band `` sells out '' . Minutes to Midnight is their best album to date . It is perhaps probably one of the best albums I have ever bought , and I was n't even expecting to like it as much.When I first found out about Linkin Park a few years ago , I dug their older albums Hybrid Theory and Meteora , and some stuff I heard from this album . But , a few months later , I went back to listening to Christian Rock music . Months later , I was back into secular music and I heard some more songs from Linkin Park and other bands . A few months after that , I had bought both Meteora and Hybrid Theory and liked them . But , they wore out on me pretty quickly , and I discovered that a band evolving is much better than a band staying the same . So I picked up this album just a few days prior to me writing this review , and I enjoyed this record.While they have changed from Meteora 's nu-metal sound to a more alternative sound and do that sound justice , most of the hard-rocking stuff falls completely flat . I find these tracks to be throwaway tracks , Given Up especially . I am sorry fans , but nothing about this song sticks out at all , and just appears to be tired and worn out . On top of all of those issues , the F-bomb is thrown around in this song like a Frisbee , and all of us know about the 18-second scream that comes off as annoying . It 's a good way to start off an album , but honestly , it 's just a throwaway track like I said . Amongst the softer songs , the only song I find to be just decent is In Between . In this song , Mike ( the emcee ) takes over the vocal tracks . While his voice is good , it 's not really as good as Chester 's voice.The softer songs on here do show us what this band has to offer on the `` alternative '' side . These songs are Leave Out All The Rest , Shadow Of The Day , What I 've Done , Valentine 's Day , In Pieces , and The Little Things Give You Away . Leave Out All The Rest is my favorite track on this album . The music is well done on this song , the lyrics are great , and Chester 's vocals on this particular song totally beat the vocals on songs such as Do n't Stay , One Step Closer , Somewhere I Belong , From the Inside , Points of Authority , any other song that they have possibly recorded . A lead singer in a band seriously ca n't be screaming , `` Shut up when I 'm talking to you ! '' or , `` The very worst part of you ... IS ME ! '' for seven years , or at this rate , twelve years of his life . On top of that , the other band members ca n't showcase their aggressive side for that long either.So , this is all I have to say about the particular album . As usual , fans are not worthy enough to give this album even one benefit , as they are all narrow minded . Like I said , a band ca n't showcase their older sound for every single record they record . It gets bothersome to people who are actually willing to see this band grow as musicians and as people . Limp Bizkit has also gotten this kick-in-the-behind by their older fans when their 2003 album Results May Vary was released . Another band that has also gotten this criticism is A Fire Inside ( AFI ) . I read Nate McCooey 's review of this album and he mentioned the same band . Seriously , America , when are we going to stop being this stupid ? Oh well , it does n't matter anyway . This album is totally a perfect addition for your collection.TRACKS : Given Up ( 1.5/5 ) Leave Out All The Rest ( 5/5 ) Bleed It Out ( 3.5/5 ) Shadow Of The Day ( 5/5 ) What I 've Done ( 5/5 ) Hands Held High ( 3.5/5 ) No More Sorrow ( 3/5 ) Valentine 's Day ( 4.5/5 ) In Between ( 3/5 ) In Pieces ( 5/5 ) The Little Things Give You Away ( 4.5/5 ) ALBUM SCORE : ( 43/55 ) Rating : 5 stars/5 stars	1
Having worked in a record store , Linkin Park was like nails on a chalkboard for everyone there . The kids liked them , but every employee there thought they sucked royally . Cut to seeing Transformers this Summer , and the closing credits played over `` What I 've Done '' finally brought me in to check them out . Bringing producer Rick Rubin in was the best move the band could have made . Gone are the lame white-boy raps , and fake techno beats , instead concentrating on a more definitive rock approach , which at this point in their career has redefined their sound , instead of stagnating like Limp Bizkit or Korn have done . Although I do n't think this will sell as well as their old albums , it is their best IMO .	1
A good number of my friends look at me with mild disgust when I suggest that Linkin Park owns a unique brand of musical genius . But as someone who listens to large quantities of music from mainstream to indie , I contend that no one has mastered the art of rap-rock like they have ( Quarashi is the only band I can think of that even belongs in the same neighborhood ) . There 's an almost mathematical perfection to both Hybrid Theory and Meteora , their first two full , non-remix albums . Ultimately , Linkin Park has offered something that I could n't find anywhere else.I 'm not one to say that bands should n't change and mature . But , honestly , I did n't want to see Linkin Park change , because they 're already unique . They have changed in Minutes to Midnight , and the metamorphosis is n't a positive one.Upon a first listen , two things are glaring:1 ) Mike Shinoda 's rapping presence is minimal . I 've always preferred Chester 's raspy vocals to Shinoda 's rapping , but he 's so underutilized on this album that you realize that he 's an integral part to the Linkin Park sound . The fusion of his rapping and Chester 's vocals combined with excellent beats and melodies makes the band.2 ) There are a lot of songs that almost qualify as ballads . The good news is , most of them are pretty pleasant . Chester really does have a great voice- even when he is n't screaming and rasping . The bad news is that they take up slots on the album that I wanted to see filled with the rap-rock-electronica-metal that immediately entranced me on Hybrid Theory and Meteora.Undoubtedly , this album is the type that grows each time you play it , but it simply does n't do what fans of the band wanted it to do . There are a few hints of where the band has been . Stand-outs What I 've Done , Bleed It Out , Given Up , and No More Sorrow all convince me that this may actually be Linkin Park and not some evil clone band from Mars.Again , the album is n't bad- I enjoyed it even on the first listen , but most of it does n't really do anything to distinguish itself from the type of alt-rock that you can find almost anywhere . 3.5 STARS	1
Seen them several times in the great city of Seattle , it was not until this album that the band finally clicked for me . People say Doppleganger and their previous material are so much better , I guess I have to disagree . Catchy chrous ' , vocals and some pretty stellar/creative guitar work I ca n't stop listening to this .	1
When listening to this CD the first time , You notice that it 's not as `` crazy '' as Doppelganger and such . But I have kept putting on in the background and now It is becoming stuck in my head and I am willingly playing it when I drive everywhere , the first 4 songs start off the CD amazingly.This CD does n't get repetitive like some of the songs off of Doppelganger . This Fall of Troy is fantastic . You will realize how great and just as hard and crazy it is once you give it a few spins . This is by far the best Fall of Troy CD to date and would n't mind them staying in this direction.Top songs : '' Cut Down the Trees '' '' Dark Trail '' '' Quarter Past '' '' Ex-Creations ''	1
Boondox 's Punkinhead EP will keep you listening and in anticipation for his next project.There are 5 new tracks , well 4 minus the Intro , and 2 remixes from The Harvest . This EP is short and devastating . `` Resurrection '' is a short scary intro warning of what inevitably leads to the resurrection of a nightmare . `` Punkinhed '' is the devastating title track . Boondox captured the legendary monster and wrapped the beast up into an amazing track . If Pumpkinhead could have written a song and rapped about where he came from , it would sound similar to this . `` Sleep Stalker '' is along the same lines as ICP 's `` Sleep Walker '' , in it Boondox does n't want to go to sleep because he wakes up to murder scenes and has the same problem as Violent J did where every time he falls asleep or closes his eyes somebody dies . Violent J comes in on the chorus for this track . `` Southern Nights '' took a few listens but it 's another cool track , there 's a really good dueling harmonica and sliding guitar break in this song that 's awesome and Violent J 's all over this track . `` Suffering '' is another great track , it has the same feel as `` She 's in the River '' from The Harvest . In the song Boondox has a love interest and keeps her close by , torturing and making her suffer before she ultimately meets her untimely death , I must say Boondox comes off as quite the lady 's man on these types of tracks.REMIXES '' They Pray With Snakes '' & `` Seven '' - I cant say enough about these remixes , they 're remixes of tracks that are already great , some may look at the song list and see these tracks as filler tracks for the cd , but no , these remixes are amazing just like the rest of the entire Punkinhed EP , they 're not to be overlooked because they complete the album and go over nice with the EP as a whole.Overall , Boondox 's Punkinhed EP is extremely dark and wicked.Pumpkinhead himself would have to give Boondox props for the justice he gave to this legendary monster .	1
Listening to Yolanda has always been a delight . In this album , she listed what she called the `` best '' . The truth is all her songs are great ! Dr . Israel King , Ph.D . Author ofHow To Keep A Man	1
Everything You Feel rocks ! Other good songs are Another Lifetime , I Needed to Fall , and Smilin ' In The End .	1
This CD is fantastic . It has a little bit of something for everyone . Another reviewer mentioned that only hardcore REO fans could really love this CD ; while I 'll admit to being a long time hardcore REO Speedwagon fan , I 've played this CD for folks who have never really paid attention to REO Speedwagon outside of `` Ca n't Fight This Feeling '' or `` Take It on the Run '' ... and they have loved this CD . They have loved it even more on the second and third listens.The music is crisp and energetic . The lyrics are clear and meaningful . The vocals and harmonies are tight . These are the things that make REO Speedwagon songs something special and all of the songs on the CD are strong . Each song has a different sound and a different feel to it.I have listened to this CD every day for the past 3 weeks and I continue to find more things to like about it . My favorite song on the CD changes daily , it seems , based on whatever mood I am in on that particular day , but if I had to choose a single favorite song it might be `` Everything You Feel '' . There are literally no songs on this CD that I do not enjoy.If you are an REO Speedwagon fan or if you enjoy melodic rock , this is a must have for your CD collection .	1
About the packaged kit later.About the music : This CD is what I would call the equivalent of an acoustic or live CD . Less distorions , less electronic sounds , more hard guitar , more real instruments or real instrument samples.The band made over 100 starts of music for this CD , and chose these . Every song is well mastered . I respect an artists ' choices of expression , and realize that people are not static -- they grow , change , learn , age and evolve . This is a perfect evolution . No jumping from monkeys to humans here , its easy to see how they got to this place . They said they intentionally tried to abandon everything that was `` comfortable , easy and they 'd done before '' . That 's clear.Its clear here that LP has done what they wanted to do , and not what they `` thought they should do '' . Yet they prove that they can still be what they were ( track 2 , example ) , and chose not to be that . Bands typically take one of two routes -- replicating exactly what they 've done to make more cash , or doing what they feel , to be a real artistic group . They are being real artists here.I feel influences here that I have n't heard before -- Metallica , U2 , Coldplay a bit , some NIN like beats in one spot , a small Blue October feel with some more calm introspective stuff that I have n't quite identified yet . It 's all good . No bubble gum pop , no 80 's hair band stuff . Some incredibly hard stuff , some very revealing stuff.I found myself liking the stuff that was most atypical because its like getting to see the other side of someone you feel like you know well . Deeper , different , and thought provoking.In this CD Chester is more able to do his thing . Shinoda is more able to do his thing as well . Shinoda is n't limited to his 5 second hip hop responses to Chester 's chrous . That 's refreshing that each gets full time to do his respective thing.It was said that each member of the band contributed just as much as the others during the process of development of tracks , where previously it would be the Shinoda & Chester . It 's clear that others had more input.I 'd almost say this CD could be considered a `` Prequel '' . I think had the band had the full freedom to do what they wanted , their first CD may have sounded like this.There is a marked uptick in the curse factor . I know how difficult it is to refrain from that , and with the first two instances I smiled and chuckled , becuase I had a great feeling of release for them . Be real and let it all out ... I have only had it one day , so I 'm refraining from making an outright `` AWESOME ! '' . It definitely does n't suck , I would n't even call it mediocre . It 's good . I just do n't know if I 've had enough time to discover how good it is.I do n't like artists who sound exactly the same on every album . Those are the ones who get a single play , and get put away . I do n't expect people to not evolve . Its like going back to your home town and expecting your old friends to be who they were `` back then '' . `` Back then '' is n't anymore.The packaging : Very _very_ nice book looking booklet with the DVD of PCM audio , interactive stuff for the PC including MP3 's so you do n't have to extract . Images , PDF of the album book internals . More.I always buy every LP CD , because I respect them as a group . They do their own artwork , and I really appreciate that as well . I take it in as their conveying an artistic message . I listen , chew it up , think about it.If you are one who listens to the words , you will definitely not be disappointed here . Lyrically , as good as ever . [ edit in , a couple days later ] I ca n't put the CD down . I am really liking it , a LOT . If I could change the 4 star to a 5 , I would do so . I think a lot of people who have been reviewing the standard CD could really benefit from the video on the DVD about the making of the CD . It really makes it all make sense.The only additional comment , is that I still really like the new totally different introspective slower tracks . I also really like stuff like track 2 . I wish they would have released a dual disc set here -- one CD of hard hard stuff , a CD of the introspective slower quieter stuff . That way , instead of a roller coaster of emotions , you can `` get it out '' whether you 're feeling the need to rock , or to chill.I want more of those 100 , soon . I feel like I want to encourage them to really push the fringes with the house beats on a couple tracks , the slow almost beatless tracks , and the industrial beat/80 's Police style beats mixed 50/50 . Great stuff .	1
Ulrich Schnauss occpupies a very unusual space between ambient and dance pop , that no-one else gets close . I absolutely love it . Thinking man 's ambient pop . Just listen to track 3 - Stars for a perfect introduction to Schnauss at his best . A galactic retro dance pop classic . The production and synthetic sounds are just sublime . I think it is excellent chillout music except I mean that as great music to play whilst having dinner with friends ( not the turgid music that generally fills this genre ) . I do agree that it is probably not as good as the first two albums , but given that the are near perfect I hardly think that this is a problem.Highly recommended !	1
Techno atmospheric heaven . Gorgeous sonic landscapes that do n't melt into unremembered haze . Brilliant , exciting and mood altering . Moby times ten . Wow	1
I am entering my opinion on this set rather late in the game . Initially my delay was created by attempting to decide between the Liceu performance and this one ; obviously I opted for the Russian/French performance.That most of us know this work at all is due to its revival at Pesaro and subsequent recording on DGG . In a sense it `` disappeared '' for the greater part of a century and even though Rossini co-opted much of the music of Viaggio for Le Conte Ory , that work had few performances until after WWII . The recording set a very high standard of Rossini singing . Would that there have been cameras present to memorialize the production . It is truly amazing to think that Russia would be able to gather a group of attractive singers who could grasp the style of early 19th century Rossini and for the most part compete with singers from Western Europe who would be more at home with this period . Obviously vocal pedagogy has moved in Russia to a more inclusive embrace of western styles . None of the singers with one exception , have had a presence in houses outside of Russia , the one exception being Danill Shtoda . It should be added that the group of singers assembled for the Liceu production are hardly more `` starry '' or international than what we have at the Chatelet but I gather that neither the production nor the singing can compete with this Opus Arte set.It would be wonderful if a production could be mounted with the likes Juan Diego Florz , DiDonato , et . al , but finanial constraints being what they are it is hardly likely . In the meantime you can enjoy a highly professional well sung performance of a work that is not likely to come to your nearest megaplex , courtesy of a Met HD production .	1
The good and bad news about reviewing music . Bad : everyone has different tastes , so no one 's review of `` it 's good '' / '' it 's bad '' is useful . Good : on sites like this , you can preview the music and find out for yourself if you 'll like itMy own take : i 'm one of the people who loved the old screaming Used . i like that style of music , i liked those songs . i was n't thrilled with the second album , but it was OK . This one i hated at first , but after forcing myself to listen to it a couple dozen times , i 've decided that it 's forgettable but not terrible . Just not goodThe important thing to know : they do n't sound like they used to . Whether that 's good or bad is up to youAs a note , one reviewer argued they were bad by saying they sounded like Panic at the Disco or Fall Out Boy . They do n't . i really like Panic and i like some of Fall Out Boy 's songs but i do n't like this album . i 'm not sure who they sound like . Maybe just a generic alt rock band on the soft ballad side . i 'm right now trying to remember one of their songs so i can tell you who they sound like but i honestly ca n't remember a one of them	1
Just like the title says , I enjoyed the album ... and I have listened to it a few times . The band has changed quite a bit , but I like the change . There is less screaming , but when Bert does scream , it is pretty deep . And Bert even does some death metal screaming at one point , which was pretty awesome . Oh , and also , there are horns ! It was a risk , but I think that it was for the best . The songs in which the horns are most prominent are in `` Paralyzed '' and `` With Me Tonight '' .I do n't want to go crazy in analyzing the album ... I just want to say that I liked it a lot . Also , The Used are different from the other mainstream alternative ( emo ) bands out there . I , for one , prefer the underground screamo post-hardcore genre . But The Used have always been one of my favorites.Yep ... that 's all . If you like the Used , buy the album , you will not be disappointed . All the songs sound different , which is also important . And the hardest songs , would be `` Pretty Handsome Awkward '' , `` Wake the Dead '' and `` Liar Liar '' . And every song has a bridge that pretty much changes the entire song ... there is a lot of diversity in each track.Enjoy !	1
Fun band , nothing more nothing less . Let 's face it . Thats what they are . I feel like their part of the grunge scene from the early 90 's and the lead singer looks alot like Kurt Cobain . They never usally mention Nirvana but the lead singer in particular was apparently inspired by him . Not ground breaking music , but good at what they do .	1
Let me first say that all of the reviews giving this album a bad rap are simply ridiculous . You obviously have no idea who the Used are or what their music represents . Apparently , you somehow missed the subject matter of this album and only compared the music , not the lyrics with their past albums . This is the same Used that we have always listened to . It is a chaotic , in your face , passionate love song . Lies for the Liars is a very well done album ! The music and lyrics work perfectly just as with past albums . Granted my personal favorites are still the `` self titled '' and `` In Love & Death '' albums , but Lies for the Liars shows promise . The album is full of angst , heart , frustration and love . To put it bluntly , get this album is you are a true Used fan . Do n't read the negative reviews they have no idea what they are addressing . If you enjoyed past Used albums you will enjoy this . Ever band changes ( grows ) over the years musically as well as lyrically , so did the Used . This is NOT screamo . It 's closer to Post Hardcore if you plan to classify it at all . Lies for the Liars is a fistful of love to the ears !	1
With the release of their self titled debut and `` In Love and Death '' and even their new live record `` Berth '' , The Used have set their sights on the punk/emo scene with their new album `` Lies for the Liars '' , which IMO is their best album to date . This is probably their most hardcore album to date.Although a bit short ( 39 minutes ? ) , LFL is an essential to all Used fans.It has great music . My favorite songs are The Bird And The Worm , The Ripper , and Liar Liar . THis album proves that they 're hardcore , not emo . They used to be Emo in ILAD , but not anymore . This album rocks !	1
Absolutely love this album , plays super well . No skips or scratches . Had no idea the record would be pink instead of the original black . Loved that ! Overall it 's probably one of my favorite records : )	1
As I listened to Elizabeth Cook 's new album Balls , I wanted to open the window and scream , `` Why does n't country radio play her songs ? '' I love country music that sounds authentic , the kind that one has to search the internet to find . Cook 's music definitely fits the bill . I really appreciated the blend of different old-time sounds : bluegrass , rockabilly and traditional country . Cooks seamlessly blends the three styles while giving it her own unique twist.Balls is a stellar album from an undervalued singer . All eleven tracks are fantastic and make for great car-ride play . Not only does Cook possess a sweet soprano voice similar to Alison Krauss , but great songwriting ability as well . On the opening track , `` Times are Tough in Rock n ' Roll , '' a bluegrass-flavored tune , Cooks makes her disapproval with the current state of pop music known loudly and clearly . `` Sometimes It Takes Balls to Be a Woman '' is a rousing feminist anthem with a rockabilly sound . `` He Got No Heart '' blasts a lover with the searing line : `` I 'd shoot him down if I knew where to aim . `` Perhaps one day country radio will wake up and discover Elizabeth Cook is the real deal : a traditional country singer with soul , and a songwriter with much to say .	1
I was alerted to Elizabeth Cook by radio presenter Bob Harris here in UK.Elizabeth cook sings traditional ( real ) country music , appreciates genuine musicianship , has a fine voice ( and is also stunning to look at ) . If you are sick of pop-country artists who ditch the genre the moment they get some success ( Carrie Underwood , Taylor Swift ) - rest assured Elizabeth Cook is the real thing . She regularly plays the Grand Ole Opry and will have much success amongst real country fans . The track Mama 's Prayers and a cover of Sunday Morning are just 2 highlights of the CD .	1

If you claim to know anything about extreme metal , then you know Marduk . They 're an influential Swedish black metal quartet that has been terrorizing the neighborhood since the early Nineties with overtly Satanic subject matter , vile vocals , blazing tempos , blistering guitars , and , most famously , breakneck drumming . With that said , do not be too quick to assume that you already know what to expect from their tenth and newest full-length . Marduk 's same basic sound may be the same , but `` Rom 5:12 '' also varies the formula a bit by adding a good fair amount of undeniable nuance , depth , tempo variation , and more intelligent , developed songwriting and sophisticated song structures.There are ten songs presented on this album , and exactly half of them find Marduk stepping outside of their comfort zone and expanding their horizons significantly with new ( and dare I say `` experimental ? '' ) ideas . The first of which , `` The Levelling Dust , '' boasts a good , juicy , mid-tempo , and even quite catchy thrash riff , deft , thumping drums , and extremely vile and acidic vocals from Mortuus , making it a strong opener . Track three , `` Imago Mortis , '' slows the album 's pace down considerably with a basic drum beat , slow , slithering , groove-oriented guitar line , and absolutely crawling tempo . Needless to say , it is a terrifically ominous piece , and one that chills the listener to the bone . Next , the brilliant use of a rhythmic , martial drum beat , haunted church-ish organ , and moody , classic-sounding keyboards ( which are simultaneously soothing and mildly unsettling ) make `` 1651 '' equally as dark and spooky . Finally , `` Accuser / Opposer '' and `` Womb of Perishableness '' are also both quite restrained , and are backed by fat , churning , stop-start riffs that drone on and on . The former tune is also of note for its strategically-placed use of atmospheric Latin chants ( at the end ) ; and the latter for its strong , persistent bass line.Fear not , though , longtime fans -- the rest of the material on display here is classic Marduk . `` Cold Mouth Prayer , '' which includes guest vocals from former member Joakim Gothberg , is a ferocious , bludgeoning , rip-roaring statement-of-intent . Its surging , searing , wall-of-sound guitars , and furious , pummeling blast beats should fill doctors ' offices around the world with patients who need a neck brace . `` Through The Belly Of Damnation '' ( which is highlighted by truly mindblowing hyperblasts ) , `` Limbs Of Worship , '' `` Vanity Of Vanities , '' and the closing `` Voices From Avignon '' all follow suit later on by ripping with vengeance and unleashing a murderous , scorched earth attack that is positively skull-crushing . But even these classic Marduk-esque blasters come across as somewhat new and refreshing -- it 's clear that the band are as hungry as ever , and it sounds as if they might even have something to prove . As a result , these songs are quite a bit more memorable than what was heard on earlier albums . `` Rom 5:12 '' is easily Marduk 's best and most expansive , accomplished , varied , original , well-rounded , and memorable effort to date . It is n't exactly a groundbreaking album , but it does rank right alongside 2007 's finest black metal releases ( it 's definitely in the top three ) , and all modern black metal in general . And it sure is n't guaranteed to change the mind of anyone who is n't already a devoted Marduk follower , but all aficionados of the band ( and genre ) will readily eat it up .	1
A pleasant listening experience , a very pleasant listening experience . With Marduk you 're never quit sure what you 'll get : La Grande Danse Macabre , World Funeral , Plague Angel or Panzer Division Marduk . Although the sound may very , you can be sure that buying a Marduk album is buying a one way ticket to HELL . If those Judeo Bible pushers are right , and this will send me to hell , I 'm proud to back my bags and be on my way.From the moment the album starts to moment it finishes , Rom 5:12 is an assault . An assault on your eardrums , an assault on society , and an assault on tradition . This album pounds and pummels you until you ca n't possibly take anymore , and when it 's over , somehow , you push play again . The songs are fast , intense and have lot 's of depth . Someway , somehow , after all these years , Marduk manages to gear up and sound fresh all over again . No matter how many times I listen to this album it never gets old . Every time I listen to it ( in the headphones ) I hear something new : A bell , A whistle , A growl , something.Bottom Line : This album is a must have . If you 're a fan of Marduk , you will not be disappointed . If you 're not a fan , this album might make you one , or at least give you a reason to have some Marduk in your collection .	1
As soon as I heard the first song I knew this was going to be good . Rom . 5:12 just kept getting better as it went on.Soon I discovered that Marduk was turning into my favorite black metal band . I do n't care what `` true '' BM thinks . I 'm about being true too ... to MYSELF.Meaty AND clear production . A great balance of all the instruments.The vocals are guttural yes , but mostly discernable . Switching up from lows to highs and then the extremity gives way to actual singing at times , which is unexpected . The delivery is always so appealing to my sense of what it means to be passionate about what you love most . Most times Mortuus sounds like his throat is slashed open . Real gurgled sounding . His vocal style stands out in a genre that sees stand outs less and less.The bass has always been up in the mix in Marduk 's other albums , and this is still pretty much the case here . Solid.The guitar IS KILLER ! Morgan keeps it interesting with the time changes . Some songs are slow . Kinda epic . Marduk are still FAST . No b/s here . Urgent , confrontational and catchy even . I love Morgan 's guitar sound . Devastating and clear , executed with brute will and forcefulness . Makes me glad to be a man.Now the drummer on the slow tracks is a good man . But the guy on the fast stuff is so damn amazing that I could go on and on about how tight , fast and varied the drumming is . Just plain FUN to listen to ! Yeah , this album is fun ! Highly recommended .	1
This time Marduk hit the nail in the head bigtime . So much so they make up for the 2 previous albums which , if flawed either cohesivesily like World Funeral or sonically like Plague Angel had their very nice moments and enough merit to consider them OK -esp on a live environment like on their terrific Blood Puke Salvation dvd.Following the current trend of inviting former musicians to play on their albums , there are a former drummer and a singer doing additional vocals on some songs . Sound like it would n't work ? Guess again ! It rocks ! Indeed , the drumming harks back to previous Marduk albums although following simpler , sparser , more rock'n roll oriented patterns . Guest vocals are a welcome variation and Mortuus ' vocal style kept developing in the form of aspired effects and his voice is now pleasantly higher in the mix , which he was deserving from their debut with the band . He is no longer coaxed to sound like Legion since either he and Devo now contribute to the lyrics , production and arrangements . Morgan has loosened his grip on the rest of the band and it does show in the general sound and atmosphere of the album.Sonically , it masterfully combines slow and blisteringly fast-paced blastbeat-happy songs -only not abusing either elements- with a lot of a more hardcore-oriented sound , not norsecore , but hardcore-punk.There is a long , brooding intrumental/orchestral interlude with some Arditi dude ? as guest that provides a respite from the sonic carnage and then the aural attack is mercilessly resumed . Plague Angel had one of these as well.The booklet deserves a chapter of its own . It 's chock full of photos and sinister artwork intercalated with lyrics written in the most unreadable gothic typography I 've ever seen , so unless you can make them from the cd , forget about them . It 's lavishly laid out and so thick it barely fits the jewel box , even making the cover in my copy to bulge out as if was going to burst out.The sound , on the other hand , is polished and perfect , it has the terrific bottom end of World Funeral and the sharp upper end of Plague Angel combined , and then some . Sonical bliss if you ask me . I LOVE THIS ALBUM , and it 's theor best so far IMHO . Not a return to their roots , mind you , but a return to form.I for one ca n't wait till Wormwood comes out . If it 's half as good as this one , I 'll be in heaven ( I mean hell ; - )	1
This set caps the re-release of the first four AP-supervised remastered titles ( three more to follow in September '07 , and the final three in December ) .For this edition , for the first time on CD , we finally get the original 1976 mix of the album that started it all . While I definitely prefer the '87 remix , there are passages in the original I also enjoy , so it 's great to finally be able to compare the two , especially in glorious , remastered form.In the additional material , there are two excellent spoken-word pieces : One , Orson Welles ' entire original recitation , sans music/effects , and also a very enjoyable 8+ minute 1976 radio interview with AP and EW.The booklet is a wonderful , detailed labor of love , with a great essay.If you 're an APP fan , this is an absolute must-own .	1
'Tales of Mystery and Imagination ' , a concept album based on the works of Edgar Allen Poe , first appeared on LP in 1976 , reappearing ( in remastered form ) on CD in 1987 . This 2-disc remastered resissue contains both the 1976 and the 1987 versions , together with a great deal of interesting bonus material . Hitherto , the 1976 version had never appeared on CD.Inclusion of the original 1976 version makes this a particularly welcome reissue because , in my opinion , the 1987 version was significantly weaker than the original , lacking much of the bite of the 1976 production . Originally intended not as the name of a band but , rather , as a one-off exercise , the Alan Parsons Project went on to become one of the most successful and original of prog rock acts , but this is where it all began . From the very first cadences to the end , this is a gripping and enjoyable album of remarkable originality and power . Superb stuff , and the sonic quality of this reissue is excellent . Enjoy !	1
The first of The Alan Parsons Project albums set the footprint for his career to follow : choose a concept and then base progressive , highly structured and immaculately produced music around it . In the case of `` Tales Of Mystery , '' it was Edgar Allan Poe . My original copy of this was on vinyl , a reissue of the 20th Century Records release with a second version of the cover , depicting a bust of Parsons somewhat wrapped in mummy-bandages . ( The long shadow on the CD cover minus the mummy photos was the original cover . ) Featuring several of APP 's soon to be regular cast , collaborator Eric Woolfson and members of the groups Ambrosia ( Parsons produced the debut `` Ambrosia '' ) and Pilot , it was the kind of album that got labeled `` head music '' in the seventies . Perfect for listening to with headphones or while hanging out with friends in a room full of black light posters while probably not 100 % sober.Some 30 years later and more often sober while listening to CD 's , this album holds up well for its first half . The trademarks of APP appear in songs like `` The Raven '' and the instrumental `` Dream Within A Dream . '' There was even a minor hit single as `` The System Of Doctor Tarr and Professor Feather '' slipped into the lower reaches of the top 40 . The album 's final Beatlesque ballad , `` To One In Paradise , '' sounds worthy of Abby Road and is indicative of hits to come - think of `` Time . `` On the other hand , the 15 minute `` The Fall Of The House Of Usher '' is a soundtrack in search of a video accompaniment . While a younger and more - ummm ... - 'stimulated ' imagination might have filled in the picture , it now just sounds like background buzz . While I do n't mind the stentorian narration Parsons added from Orson Welles for the 1987 CD release , the additional synthesizers and solo guitars are an irritant . They could have left well-enough alone , but since CD technology was the shiny new thing at the time , I do n't blame Parsons for wanting to tweak the new version.Now , however , you have both versions in one box . This ups my original rating from 3 stars to four , as the sonic enhancements make the twin discs sound even better . For the first time since a long OOP Mobile Fidelity Disc , you can hear the version of this album in its original context , minus the extra guitars and synths . The demos add little to the package , but the bare narration from Orson Welles ( and the radio spot ) are worth a smile . As soon as I saw this at a domestic price , I knew I 'd have to own it , and it was worth the investment.As far as its place in the APP discography , I probably prefer `` I Robot , '' `` Pyramid '' and `` Eye in the Sky '' ahead of `` Tales Of Mystery . '' But for shear audacity ( mixing classics of literature with rock music was considered pretty risky in 1976 ) , the Alan Parsons Project debut still can stimulate .	1
Brecker could never do anything wrong in my opinion , and so nobody will expect me to write a critical , balanced review of Pilgrimage . But even compared to the other Brecker albums , and especially with the knowledge that not only was this his last album , but probably one of the last times these masters and friends would see him , it is brilliant . It has the haunting , fragile , and urgent energy of a dying wish . At the same time , it conveys peace , joy , and caring for life . Everybody is at their best , and no Brecker fan will want to be without it . Preaching to the quire aside , it is also a good place to start your Brecker or modern jazz listening experience , as the album is quite accessible in its simple complexity . Absolutely recommended .	1
. . . hardly like a man suffering from a rare blood disease with less than half a year to live . That 's the first thing you notice.The second thing is the power and precision of his playing . The thirteen-time Grammy winner and premier saxophonist of his generation seems to have lost nothing . Backed by his peers ( Herbie Hancock and Brad Mehldau , piano ; Pat Metheny , guitar ; John Patitucci , bass ; and Jack DeJohnette , drums ) , playing nine attractive new self-penned compositions , he sounds as energized and expressive as ever.The third thing is how wonderfully this gathering of absolutely first-rank jazz players works together , setting aside egos , focusing all their attention on making the music sing and ring with beauty and authority . After all , these superstar sessions do n't always work . Proof ? The gorgeous ensemble playing up to , behind , and following the leader 's stunning solo on `` Five Months from Midnight . '' Or on `` Anagram , '' a Shorter-ish piece with a tricky unison head nailed by Brecker and Metheny , then sailing off into the wild blue yonder with another heroic solo by the leader as the band provides provocative comping for him to riff off of , power-driven by some of DeJohnette 's finest drumming on disc . When Metheny comes in with his own wonderfully conceived solo statement , the feel 's one of tribute , a tip of the hat , to the leader , without the slightest shred of cutting or one-upmanship . Mehldau 's solo , one of his finest , also sparkles with wit and approbation . DeJohnette follows with some controlled mayhem on his kit , and it all ends with a reprise of the head and a rousing ensemble send-off.The churning , chugging `` Tumbleweed , '' with its wild-west feel mapped onto some ur-heartland vibe , shakes things up , nicely framed by a bit of eldritch wordless vocals and Metheny 's tasty guitar-synth solo followed by a driving statement from the leader . Mehldau keeps things rolling with a quirky , percussively outrageous solo , and everyone comes back in for a rousing finale . Certainly a high point in a record bursting with passage after passage of brilliant playing.Even the balladic `` When Can I Kiss You Again ? '' though starting out gently enough , eventually gets the fully energized treatment with an emotionally searing solo by the leader that builds gloriously and then backs into tranquility . `` Cardinal Rule '' likewise begins innocently enough only to be goosed into overdrive by some killer unison lines from , again , the leader and Metheny and a nimble solo from Patitucci . The mid-tempo , samba-like `` Half Moon Lane '' shows a mellower side of leader and band , but its pure melody , easy Latin groove , and deft yet heartfelt sensibility maintain the highest level of playing . `` Loose Threads , '' another south-of-the-border tune , but with a little more muscle and a wackily fractured sense of time , nicely caps the previous number.With `` Pilgrimage , '' the last cut , we 're deep into the mystic . Hancock 's ethereal electric piano sets the table for this symbolic voyage into the unknown . But there 's nothing New Age-y or sentimental about this piece . Instead , we get glorious sound vistas anchored to a hard-headed sense of both one 's mortality , and the hope of a better beyond , beautifully expressed in Brecker 's magical EWI solo . The sense I get is something akin to C. S. Lewis 's vision of the weight of glory , the idea that Heaven is so much more real and substantial than earthly existence that were mere mortals to travel there they would find the grass so sharp as to cut their feet.One mourns the untimely passing of such an imposing and heroic musical figure as Michael Brecker . But at the same time we can rejoice not only that he has gone on , one hopes , to a better place , but also because of the iridescence of his last musical statement .	1
Enjoyed Michael 's work with Pat on the Joni Mitchell Shadows and Light disc . What a great musician . Ca n't believe it took me this long to acquire A Brecker disc . There will be more .	1
I HAD PURCHASED THIS CD WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT , AND IT SAT THERE FOR A LONG TIME ... UC MIKE WAS GONE AND SOMEHOW I COULDNT BRING MYSELF TO LISTEN TO HIS LAST WORK.WELL WE GOT SNOWED IN FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AND I LISTENED TO A LOT OF MUSIC , SO BROKE DOWN AND FIRED IT UP ...

HOW MANY COMMERCIAL JINGLES DO YOU HEAR WITH A SAX PLAYING AND THEN REALIZE ITS MIKE ... ALL THOSE CAMEO APPEARENCES ON WHO KNOWS HOW MANY ALBUMS-THE LIST IS ENDLESS-AND TO HAVE HIS FAVORITE MUSICIANS SEND HIM OFF WITH THIS WONDERFUL PERFORMACE IS SO FITTING ... WE ALL MISS YOU MIKE ! ! ! !	1
De praise & worship 'scene ' is overvol en dan is het lastig je eigen footprint te definiren . Na het debuut in 2004 met de # 1 'hit ' Glory Defined , albums Space In Between Us en Rise , gooit het trio Jason Roy ( guitar , vocals ) , Michael Anderson ( drums ) en Jesse Garcia ( keys , guitar ) het ditmaal over de pop/rock boeg van Snow Patrol , Vega4 , Anberlin en - wie niet - U2 ( Incredible heeft wel wat van Beautiful Day ) met natuurlijk de focus op God , de Schepper . Gods genade voor zondaars ( Power of Your Name , You Carried Me , Amazed , Incredible ) , de zekerheid van Zijn hulp ( Singing over Me ) en eigentijdse bewerkingen van psalmen ( Grace That Is Greater ) . Naast veteraan producer Brown Bannister ( Amy Grant , Twila Paris , MercyMe , The Afters , Steven Curtis Chapman , Third Day ) werkten onder meer de Britse tekstschrijver Chris Eaton ( Amy Grant , Point Of Grace , Jaci Velasquez , Vince Gill ) ( de songs Incredible , Singing Over Me , Power of Your Name ) en musici als Erik Darken ( percussie ) , Otto Price ( bas ) en Blair Masters ( keyboards ) aan de stevige soundscapes . You Carried Me gooit hoge ogen als opvolger van Glory Defined , hoewel Iris To Iris vooral als album beluisterd kan en mag worden . Kritisch punt in veel worship songs blijft de tekst ( hoewel het daar toch om draait ? ) : minimalisme in vocabulaire , herhalingen , e.d . zijn ook bij Buidling 429 schering en inslag , hoewel 'slimmer vormgegegeven ' . Bij concentratie op de rock en de CD als geheel wil de replay toets best werken !	1
Building 429 hit the scene big with their debut single Glory Defined and their solid debut album The Space In Between Us . Their style had a bit of grunge mixed with solid worship lyrics , fitting since the band name is based on Ephesians 4:29 , which is a great life verse . After much acclaim and a Dove Award for Best New Artist 2005 , Building 429 came back with a somewhat more rocking Rise , with the hit song Fearless.Iris To Iris is the third and final Building 429 album on Word Records and is actually my favorite overall . The band certainly toned down and the grunge influence seems gone . This album is easily the most worship focused as evidenced by the stand-out songs Power Of Your Name , Majesty , You Carried Me and a great re-write of Grace That Is Greater . My favorite overall song is Singing Over Me , based on Zephaniah 3:17 . This is a solid rock worship album and if you like Jeremy Camp , Casting Crowns or MercyMe , you should enjoy Building 429 .	1
I loved Derek 's debut album `` She Must and Shall Go Free '' due to my following him with Caedmon 's Call and really respecting his desire to make his own `` message '' album and that is still my favorite . I liked Derek 's other work in between but found the lyrics to be stronger than the melodies . He returned to form on `` The Ringing Bell '' with possibly his strongest lyrics overall and definitely his best melodies . I love `` I Wan na Marry You All Over Again '' , `` Name '' , and `` I Do n't Want To Fight '' and it 's my 2nd favorite overall .	1
This collection is very similar , if not identical to the older Very Best Of Elvis Costello And The Attractions . However that 's out of print ( though pennies used ) .Elvis Costello was a name I always heard , but I never really made a point to listen to his music . Then I got this disc , and now I often make the point . These songs are incredible , and I wish I gave them a chance sooner . I was also suprised by how many songs I knew , even if not by title . This includes his hits `` Alison '' , `` Watching The Detectives '' , `` Pump It Up '' , and `` Everyday I Write The Book '' . But what 's really great , is that most of the minor hits are even better . `` Oliver 's Army '' , `` Man Out Of Time '' and `` Brilliant Mistake '' are amazing.If you dig this , may I also suggest a collection from Joe Jackson .	1
In my opinion , this is the best single-disc Elvis Costello compilation anyone has ever released . In fact , it may even be the best introduction to E.C . out there ( He 's so stylistically diverse that no single album is an effective introduction , and both of the more extensive collections - `` Girls Girls Girls '' on Columbia and `` The Very Best of Elvis Costello '' on Rhino - would probably be overwhelming to someone unfamiliar with the majority of his work ) . Also , the collection `` Rock and Roll Music , '' as is evident in the title , ignores his non- '' Rock and Roll '' songs.But this disc finally gets it right . There was a `` The Very Best of Elvis Costello & the Attractions '' single-disc issued on Rykodisc in 1994 that came close , but as good as that disc was , this collection makes three substitutions that are actually improvements : `` ( The Angels Want to Wear My ) Red Shoes , '' `` New Lace Sleeves , '' and `` Almost Blue '' replace `` Watch Your Step , '' `` New Amsterdam , '' and `` Love Field . `` Not only are the substitutions slightly better songs in my opinion , they also paint a more complete picture of Elvis Costello as an artist and writer . Especially `` Red Shoes '' - if you 'd only heard the ballad `` Alison '' and the reggae-influenced `` Watching the Detectives '' from his debut album , you 'd have no idea what to expect from the rest of the CD , but `` Red Shoes '' really sets the tone for the rest of that disc ( and it 's just an amazing song ) . Some people complain that these songs have been repackaged too many times , but I have a hard time arguing with the final result.The remastering of this collection sounds as good as the Rhino remasters ( which managed to be a slight improvement over the already great-sounding Rykodisc versions ) , and I really do n't understand why some people complain about the sound ( but I never owned any of the vinyl records , so maybe I am missing something ) . Still , the sound is the best that I 've heard on CD , and in terms of song selection , this is a near-perfect set . For some , this will be all the Elvis Costello they ever need . For others , it will be the beginning of a long journey into the career of one of the best , most insightful and most interesting singer-songwriters in popular music . Either way , it 's hard to go wrong with this collection .	1
I am a fan of Elvis Costello although a fairly recent one . This CD has a lot of the classics , the songs that people probably associate with him . But I came across a few I had never heard ( I did n't think ) and liked enormously . Which , to me , is testament to the fact that the man puts out some darn good music . A great buy .	1
For most of this period , Elvis Costello 's music comprised himself on vocals and guitar , backed by keyboards , bass and drums , though there were variations especially towards the end . Driving rock songs dominated , mostly written by Elvis , although the music sometimes hides the nature of the lyrics . For those who care , the booklet contains full lyrics for all the featured 22 songs.Elvis had three UK top ten hits during this period , these being Oliver 's army at # 2 , I ca n't stand up for falling down at # 4 and Good year for the roses at # 6 . He did not have an American top ten hit until 1989 , when he made # 10 with a song titled Veronica , but you 'll have to look elsewhere for that.In 1981 , just when people thought they knew what to expect from Elvis , he demonstrated his love of country music by recording a whole album of country songs with Billy Sherrill as producer . From this album , Good year for the roses became a UK top ten hit as noted above . Originally recorded by George Jones and a country hit for hum , the Elvis Costello version was clearly popular with a lot of British people , most of whom had never heard the song before . Country fans familiar with the original did n't all like it , but I did and still do.This collection contains the three UK top ten hits mentioned above along with a selection of lesser UK hits and album tracks . Among the lesser hits , Watching the detectives and ( do n't wan na go to Chelsea both made the UK top 20 and established Elvis 's credentials as a rock singer , and both are here . Alison ( a song later covered by Linda Ronstadt ) is also featured . Beyond those track , I do n't think anything essential is missing from my perspective , but others may disagree . I say it 's a great collection with everything that I expect of an Elvis Costello hits collection .	1
There have been numerous Elvis Costello compilations , but this new release focuses on the most fertile period of his career , the first ten years . Mr. Costello 's first four albums , My Aim Is True , This Years Model , Armed Forces & Get Happy ! ! ! are virtual greatest hits albums themselves . After a brief detour into country covers on Almost , he came back with the stellar Trust & Imperial Bedroom albums . Of course no one could keep up that blinding of a pace and subsequent albums that fall into this period , Punch The Clock , Goodbye Cruel World , King Of America & Blood & Chocolate are n't as strong , but do contain some first rate material . The songs have all been dissected before and fans of Mr. Costello owns these songs probably in multiple formats , but if you want an introduction into some the finest and most creative music of the late 70 's and 80 's , then this album should be in your collection .	1
By 1979 Elvis Costello and the Attractions had proven themselves to be one of the best and brightest acts to come out of the English music scene . Elvis Costello had shown over the course of three very different and distinct albums that he was nothing short of a songwriting genius . After the pop success of Armed Forces it seemed that everyone , including his label , was expecting a repeat with a similar sound and style . Elvis was n't about to be put in a box and it all came to head in April of 1979 when , during a drunken argument in a bar , Costello uttered a racial slur that gained him a fair amount of backlash and suspicion . Costello has apologized on more than one occasion and has proven over the years that he 's anything but a racist . Still , the damage was done and Elvis fought his way out of it through his music . Get Happy ! ! , released in 1980 , is one of his most ambitious and exciting efforts . It 's a mile-a-minute thrill ride through Motown and R & B ; stylings that no one could have seen coming.Elvis and the band went even further by cramming a stunning 20 songs on this record , clocking in at only 48 minutes . Most artists are lucky to produce a great album with half that many and yet Costello does n't waste a minute here . `` Love for Tender '' opens the record with some upbeat organ and a fast-paced beat that immediately lets you know that Elvis is exploring the world of funk , R & B ; , Motown , and soul . `` Opportunity '' rides a classic Motown beat and gives every member of the group a chance to really shine . In fact , while The Attractions are in fine form , it 's really bassist Bruce Thomas who dominates here . His funky basslines and sense of urgency keep every song flowing smoothly while unconsciously causing you to tap your foot . The quick-paced vibe of songs like `` High Fidelity '' and `` Human Touch '' are perfect examples of the sound Costello was going for , while slower numbers like `` New Amsterdam '' and `` Secondary Modern '' hit just as hard but in a different sort way . Even a cover of `` I Ca n't Stand Up for Falling Down '' went on to become a hit , proof that Elvis could take someone else 's song and make it his own.Lyrically the album is great but that 's not surprising because Elvis is always in fine lyrical form . The man can write , tell a story , and play with words like a walking dictionary . A special nod goes to my personal favorite , `` Temptation '' . The entire song beautifully sums up the album in terms of lyrics and music . Bruce 's bassline is incredible , Pete Thomas ' drums hit you right from the beginning and the subtle keyboards of Steve Nieve leave a haunting effect in the background . It 's truly one of Costello 's best songs and the soul-sound of it is so infectious that you 'll be humming it for hours . On a record full of stellar tunes this one really drives the whole thing home.Get Happy ! ! is an experience unlike any other in EC 's catalogue . It rushes by at a lightning pace and yet loses none of the charm and sophistication of his previous offerings . With 20 songs there 's no shortage of great material here and Costello 's foray into the world of Motown and soul is nothing short of magnificent . Even the title itself is a reference to the gospel music that obviously plays a large part on this release . It 's perfect from beginning to end and has more than stood the test of time .	1
Love For Tender is a classic . Essentially a re-write of Love Me Tender by the other better looking Elvis what can you say : ) One thing to mention is the clever monetory double meaning running throughout the lyric surely one of the more witty attempts to do this type of song - I 'll pay you a compliment , And you 'll think I am innocent , You can total up the balance sheet , And never know if I 'm a counterfeit , You wo n't take my love for tender - All sung with that negative passion he excels at . There are others goodies here too - i also think Motel Matches is on his A-List . Although he is not as consistent as some of the true greats he does have his moments up there with the big boys : ) Anyway if you want to Get Happy in a strictly cathartic sense maybe give some of these tunes a spin .	1
H.I.M is another great band from Finland to ever go gold here in the states with their album Darklight . I do suggest starting with this album and the ones before this one so you the listener can experience all the great sounds and songs they have come out with to date	1
THIS CD IS PACKED WITH THE BEST OF HIM - ALSO HAS A POSTER THAT UNFOLDS FROM THE FRONT COVER ISSERT ! ! ! I LOVE THIS CD ! ! ! !	1
After getting a little experimental with 2005 's `` Harnessing Ruin , '' Immolation storm back onto the scene two years later with the seventh full length release of their career , this year 's `` Shadows in the Light . '' Immolation seemingly had just two goals in mind when they wrote this album : focused , straightforward , compact songwriting ( almost all of the songs stay in the neighborhood of three to four minutes ) , and furious , devastating brutality . As a result , this iconic New York quartet have never sounded this hungry , aggressive , or crushing.In fact , truth be told , Immolation have always been a death metal band , but `` Shadows in the Light '' really leans more towards the grindcore side of the line . It also boasts an abnormally long ten tracks ( opposed to the band 's usual eight or nine ) . But those two things aside , every classic Immolation hallmark trait is in place on here , including abrasive , tractor-sized riffs , unorthodox soloing , free-flowing , blasting drum beats , bludgeoning rhythms , and guttural , commanding vocals.Even though the album has a somewhat brief running time , nobody should be left feeling shortchanged after listening to it , because man , Immolation sure cram a ton into these forty minutes ! Plus , it may be the heaviest release of their career thus far , but they never forget to slip in plenty of nifty , catchy hooks , and they also incorporate just enough melody ( usually through the frequent use of lead axeman Robert Vigna 's wailing , harmonic solos ) that the songs need to be memorable and avoid monotony.Opener `` Hate 's Plague '' and `` Tarnished '' are just two of the numerous incredibly tightly-knit , punishing , and mean bruisers to be found on here , and overflow with driving , incessantly pummeling blast beats , bulldozing guitar leads , and almost demonic vocals . `` Passion Kill , '' will surely soon be a set staple in Immolation 's live show . This doom-laden piece boasts blistering riffs , solo , and a really catchy chorus ( where frontman Ross Dolan evilly growls out sinister lines like `` God will punish you/God will torture you '' ) which will instantly get tattooed to your brain . `` The Weight of Devolution '' and the title cut mix things up a bit by opting for a moderately paced tempos and surprisingly groovy rhythms ( plus , the former also features excellent , wailing solos , and the latter has strategically placed , crashing high-hats ) . But later songs , like `` Breathing the Dark , '' `` Deliverer of Evil , '' and the jackhammering `` Lying with Demons '' are positively devastating , and more than make up for those two moments of somewhat restrained heaviness . Lastly of note are the tremolo picked melodies in the Eastern-tinged set closer , `` Whispering Death . `` Immolation have a sixteen-plus year under their belts so far , and even though they have been through several different record labels and band members over the years , they show absolutely no sign of aging or inconsistency . `` SITL '' is a terrifically strong and satisfying record which proves that this band is still at the top of their game , and is still going to be around for many more years to come .	1
very technical death metal with killer vocals and drumming second to none guitarist is technical sounding with the band comming together to make every song exellent as usual for this great band .	1
I noticed throughout this album 's lyrics that Jesus was hardly the subject matter . they 've separated themselves from Deicide on this album and are walking on their own path . aside from attacking Jesus , Immolation has excellent musicianship . the solos are killer , as no metal band should be without them .	1
I might get ripped for this review , but i honestly did not enjoy this DVD at all . I bought it after reading all the reviews on this site . Did not really know JB before so i approached it with an open mind . I do n't like his overexaggerated singing much , he seems to try to somewhat copy Marc Bolan ( personal opinion ) and as for craftsmanship on the instrument he seems adequate at best . The other guys look bored and i got the impression the only time they enjoyed themselves was during the heavier songs like 'kick out the jams ' . The only song i liked was the last one 'hallelujah ' but even that dragged out too much . A redeeming factor was that i aquired the DVD for a bargain and got almost all my money back when i traded it in at a different shop .	-1
The main impression I come away from this performance with is one of elderly females attempting to play young characters . Julia Varaday looks as if she were in her late sixties , and Anna Tomowa-Sintow , her late seventies.Kathleen Battle does n't look so old , but she has pitch problems.Even Samuel Ramey sounds much older than the Don should be .	-1
At this time , we all should know what a teen movie is.That predictable pink and stupid piece of ... art.But , Hey ! , i 'm not saying all teen movies are bad , but this one it is.High School , Ryan ( Shane West ) is in love with the most popular girl , called Ashley.Her boyfriend ( Chris ) is in love with Shane 's best friend , Maggie ( Marla Sokoloff ) .So they help each other to get what they want , whatever it takes.The acting is good , specially by Shane West.They all do good the stupid high school kid rol.This movie has some funny moments , like the Titanic parody in the schooll prom.Or the girls locker room , and some more.But what i did n't like was MARLA.She 's so bad acting and her character was so stupid , I mean , who is like her in real life.Sorry , did n't mean to offen you.Well , let 's wait for the next teen movie and let 's see the differences , hope to be better than this one .	-1
I was hoping this would be a decent video about potty training . It jumps around too much from character to character and from process to process . Addresses washing hands before it addresses using the potty which it called a toilet and let 's face it few kids / parents call it a toilet so that is another thing that irritated me . I have always hated that shadow chick , and she is really annoying in this series . And the `` potty time '' song with silloute stick figures is just plain stupid . There was only one redeeming scene in the actual bathroom with the little brown bear , but the rest of this was total [ ... ] . It is going in the next yard sale .	-1
Music Scene was supposed to be about the music of the time . Of course , it was . But , it was also about a political attitude and seems to have had its genesis in the perspective embodied in the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour . The show contained a lot of anti-Nixon political humor . Irrespective of a viewer 's political positions , whether one is liberal , radical , moderate or conservative , the problem here is that the humor is just not funny as delivered . Both Bob Hope and David Steinberg employed politically-oriented quips in their approach to humor . Perhaps some find this funny . If you do , fine . I find it boring . This show and its companion , volume 2 , are worth watching if you were not alive at that time and want to examine a thick slice of the culture . My comments pertain to both volumes.As fun viewing , the show is a failure . It does not work , even as nostalgia . It 's difficult to feel nostalgic listening to David Crosby implying the world would be a better place without oil companies . Nothing like living on a commune ! There is a vague emptiness I feel in watching these shows . Perhaps it 's because I wanted another Hullabaloo or Shindig , both of which were filled with convincing performances , great dancing and excitement . They made me smile . This show has an entirely different atmosphere . To use a term from that era , `` it 's a downer . '' Aside from the alleged humor , the performances often fall flat . One notable exception is Neil Diamond 's delivery of Holly Holy.If you are curious about a facet of the culture and music of 1969-70 , the show is worth viewing . If , however , you want an enjoyable music and comedy viewing experience , I 'd recommend the Dean Martin Variety Show as an alternative purchase . You wo n't stop smiling .	-1
I do not know how one can rate a dvd not released until March ? ? ? ? ? ? I have the limed Issue of Peter Pan It Is a awesome collectable copy.Now all we have are remakes of all our best Disney dvds.To make more money for disney.And their 30.0000 Factories all over the world .	-1
I expect this akin to heresy but I did n't much like this film . I never saw it as a kid but was certainly put off when I saw the iconic characters in their actual ( animated ) performances.Peter Pan is a bit of a punk , -- certainly not a role model for any child.Tinkerbell is downright malicious . The mermaids are n't much better.The positive is that the voice actors do an incredible job . Truly perfect performances throughout.The negative is that the script itself makes Never-Never Land seem like a dysfunctional playground . Maybe that 's the point , as I 've not read the book this is based upon , but it does n't fit well in my mind of a Disney classic , especially one that formed a major pillar upon which the entire Disney franchise was based upon .	-1
The theatrical release had a GREAT Johnny Winter performance of 'Big Town Blues ' , one of my favorites . I bought this after reading about all the 'extra ' footage..stupid me , I never imagined that would mean =deleting= the -best- footage ... Johnny 's gone !	-1
A particular Elvis fan favorite ? C'mon ! I 'm a huge Elvis fan , but this lousy film is in no way better than his previous films , except for the aspect of eye candy for the guys ... in the form of Ann Margret . She is definitely the star of this movie , and it 's quite obvious that the director purposely exploited Margret 's beautiful face and figure to overcompensate for the terrible script . It starts off interesting enough , albeit quite corny in places ( especially in the songs ) , but I expected that and accepted it for what it was . However , the story just gets weaker and weaker , until the end where the time span between the climax and the end of the movie is about 30 seconds . And absolutely no twists or turns in the plot to make it interesting ... just blah , the end . Just an awful movie , sorry.I really like Jailhouse House and King Creole -- those were great flicks , and not just compared to Elvis 's other movies . Even Blue Hawaii was much better than Viva Las Vegas . 4-1/2 stars as an overall rating ? ? ? Unbelievable . I guess all 4-1/2 stars go to Ann-Margret rather than the movie in general . If you want to salivate over a young , hot Ann-Margret , I recommend this movie . If you want an overall good movie , you wo n't find it here .	-1
They took one of the finest animated movies ever created and dredged up this for a sequel . Truly awful , and an insult to the creators of & quot ; Secret of NIMH & quot ; and anyone who loves it.Buy the original instead .	-1
The music is OK , but the purpose of the CD goes unfulfilled . I tried it many nights and got nothing at all from it . Probably a good way to make money , though .	-1
I concur with the negative opinions already expressed.First the positives : beautiful music , Wagnerian with a lyrical twist.The negatives : first off : maybe I 'm spoiled , but in this day there is no reason for an opera DVD NOT to have subtitles ( I hope the double negative makes sense ) . The fact that it is sung in English is no excuse , especially when Rusalka or the Princess is going full-bore in some big ensemble . ( Loud sopranos are more difficult to understand than loud male voices . ) I understood maybe one-third of the libretto . Given the heavy reinterpretation given this staging , the listener needs all the clues he/she can have . Fortunately , the Met Opera web site had a synopsis that filled in some holes . That 's one star off there.Secondly , the production makes hash of the story . While some of the negative comments of one of my fellow reviewers seems to me to be nitpicking , the general thrust seems to be valid : there is no way to integrate the story , what you see on stage , and what you hear.In the first place , if I had n't read the blurb on the DVD case ( one or two sentences long ) outlining the Freudian interpretation , there is no way to see it in the staging . The story interprets the staging , not the other way around.In the second place , based on this Freudian view , the ending makes no sense . Are we to believe that Rusalka should have never grown up ? Or , are we to say that all men are jerks , all women are ... , and that `` coming of age '' sexually will transform women into demonic seductresses who will inevitably kill men ? Huh ? ? ? ? ! ! ! That leads to my third criticism of the staging : a fairy story only works AS A FAIRY STORY . Since Tolkien ( Lord of the Rings ) is all the rage right now ( January 2004 ) , let me invoke him : to allegorize a fairy tale is to kill it . One must let the mythic archetypes stand on their own , speaking their own truth , telling their own story.The mis-staging costs another star.Generally , we have a four star DVD here , but these errors , 4-2 = 2 stars.P . S. In checking around on the web for more info on this work , I 've learned that there is a new DVD of Rusalka with Renee Fleming in the title role . Unfortunately , at the time of this writing it is only available in UK . Hopefully we can get it soon . Wait for it .	-1
I just finished watching this DVD . IT SUCKS ! I thought it was the TV Special . It was Alice Cooper 's concert for the album . The video is bad . So is the audio . The cover says it 's `` REMASTERED '' . If this is remastered . I 'd hate to see the original . If you 're looking for the actual TV Special , look for the one that is under 120 minutes AND does not include his hits from the previous years as this disc does . SHAME ON RHINO FOR GIVING US THIS CRAP !	-1
I will keep this review short & amp ; sweet ! ! The content of this DVD is AWESOME ( music & amp ; videos ) , while the DVD itself sucks ! ! I hate DVDs that are mono-layered ! ! In other words , you have to turn the DVD to see another half of material ! ! Why everything was n't on a single sided DVD is beyond me because it is n't impossible with only 106 minutes of content ! ! Get this used or extremely cheap on Ebay ! ! !	-1
After DIO Sabbath with ozzy singing is crap , he ca n't do it anymore . To think this was uspposed to be his final show and it wase n't that great . Zack Wylde ruins all the classics with his `` ehhhh '' twang instead of playing the damn songs . I hate his playing . Over all not worth the price .	-1
Until a DVD is released with footage from the Randy Rhodes era I could care less about ANYTHING else that 's released on OZZY . There may be a good song here and there ( & not to bash Zack , Jake E. & whoever else ) but to me Ozzy without Randy is irrelevant . This , of course , excludes Sabbath . I have a VHS of the `` After Hours show '' , excellent video but only mono sound , so I would LOVE a professional 5.1 or 6.1 release of it . I also have several bootleg concert VHSs and in at least one of them ( Japan - Budokan I think ) professional cameras can be seen . So the footage is out there.Ozzy ... what 's the problem ? ?	-1
There are many Celine Dion songs that I like . When I borrowed this DVD from my mother , I watched eagerly as she sang many of these favourites including & quot ; If You Asked Me To & quot ; and & quot ; Think Twice & quot ; . Straight away I thought how fantastic her voice was , and could n't believe that her performances sounded just like the recorded versions . Something puzzled me when I read the tracklist on the back cover and only one song had & quot ; Live & quot ; written after it ( & quot ; When I Fall in Love & quot ; ) . I figured that it must be a typo since the whole DVD was a live concert . Well , apparently not ! This pseudo concert is nothing more that Celine lip-syncing - quite shameful when you think about it . The only live song being the one just noted.If her voice is really as good as people claim , then why does she need to lip-synch ? Why even bother putting on the show ? We may as well all just listen to her CD 's at home ! I now wonder if her voice is manipulated in the studio to make it sound so good on record.Overall , a very disappointing DVD . Not a real concert at all/	-1
Man , is this guy boring ! I bought this dvd for all the great reviews , but was very disappointed . My mind dwelled off after two songs , and at number four I was doing something else . Sorry folks !	-1
Do yourself a favor . Get Red Hot Chili Peppers - Live at Slane Castle instead .	-1
I have reviewed 5 Beethoven DVDs . Yes the recording is old ... .but ca n't imagine why video is so poor . The real problem is we buy these great masterpieces to experience the orchestra and not the conductor . We do n't buy operas to watch the conductor nearly full time . I would agree there is little cinematography going on here ... .which seems criminal with such an important piece . I am nervous to get any Karajan piano or violin concertos les they not focus on the performer . I have a solution in Beethoven 's masterpiece . Get the recent Blu-ray Vienna performance with Thielmann conducting in glorious 1080p DTS high definition . You will always judge every classical DVD by this performance ... .especially the direction and cinematography and of course picture and sound quality .	-1
The thing that sucks about this DVD is how it 's cut , I mean it will cut off right in the middle of the song . It gets really annoying ... but it does have the videos of & quot ; Breakdown & quot ; and & quot ; The Roof & quot ; 2 of Mariah 's best videos .	-1
If youre getting this for ELP or the doors then youre gon na be disappointed . They cut them out of the movie . The doors first song on the movie is `` When the musics over , '' its cut about 2 minutes into the performance . The other performance , `` The End '' is in its entirety . ELP 's performance , ( which is the highlight of the festival and the movie ) is about 2 minutes long . You get to see them right when they start and then it cuts away to the end of their performance . So if youre wanting this movie to see ELP 's historic `` debut '' performance then forget it , youre gon na have to wait for it to come out later . If it ever does . The rest of the performances are pretty much ... The Who is terrible and you get to really see which bands were for real and which ones were n't . The best bands are cut out and the worst are all over the place . So , its your call . As far as the rest of it , its mostly some guy whining , ( concert promoter ) about why he 's losing money , and some good scenes of hippies . So if you dont care about the music so much and want to see hippies and freaks as they really were , then its worth a look , otherwise forget it .	-1
Joe Satriani is capable of much more . I think this album along with the first one proves that Joe just ca n't write actual rock songs ( outside of his solo stuff ) that are more than just mediocre . Everything is just so bland and average . I wish he would go back to doing Surfing with the Alien type music . He was so great and inspired back then . Anyway , I know people here do n't like the comparison , but the new Van Halen Album `` A Different Kind of Truth '' absolutely destroys this waste of time . I hope CF changes things a lot for their next album . I will keep buying them , but I 'm starting to lose faith that they will come out with anything decent in their current form . I do think , however , the drummer is really good , and that shows on this album .	-1
No words to desribe this atrocity ( boring ) of music ! Please see my review for the first Chickenfoot because this one is basically the same .	-1
I 'm a total Satch fan , but this release sounded overall phoned in . The singing/screaming n ' yelling just overdone and out of place too often.. maybe the next one will be better.. The first release had at least a good handful of tunes that were superstar slamming..	-1
What I 'd like to know is what the guys in the band were saying to each other when they were going over the final mix-down . It could n't have been `` Check out that guitar solo ! '' or `` This song is incredible ! '' or `` Guys , we really outdid ourselves this time ! Great work , everybody ! `` This was simply one of the worst compilations of `` rock '' music I have ever heard . The riffs are boring ! The lyrics are boring ! The music is boring ! This album is garbage . There is n't one single memorable hook or lyric on it . It was a total and complete waste of money ! They should have named the album `` Apocalyptic Sleeping Pill. '' Clank ! Clank ! Clank ! ( That was the sound of the CD smacking the sides of the trash can ) .	-1
Long-time Rush fan here ( 30+ years ) , beginning with the first album and continuing on . Regrettably , I have to say this release is GOD AWFUL . It just goes from bad to worse . For the life of me I can not understand all of these high reviews . For me , I find the songwriting to be extremely poor , not a memorable tune here . The guitar work is unimaginative and very average . I did n't dig Geddy 's singing either -- he seems unable to write and deliver a good hook or melody . The quality of the recording stinks too . By today 's standards ( and those of yesteryear ) this release is a complete an utter loser.Sorry guys , but this is THE WORST CD I have heard in years . I want my money back ! ! ! ! !	-1
While technically stunning in concept and execution , the music is surprisingly empty - none of it reached me . Surprising , as that 's a rare occurance for Rush . There just is n't anything that remained in my mind ( or soul ) after a couple listens . Disappointing .	-1
I remember while most teenagers in the mid to late 90 's were listening to pop , rap , country , or crappy alternative stuff that was apssing for rock , I was listening to bands teens 10 and 20 years prior were listening to , Scorpions , Motley Crue , Led Zeppelin , Rush , ACDC to name just a few , but all bands you know and many you could probably guess . Rush happened to be one of my favorites out of the lot . My picks for best and worst albums would differ greatly from typical Rush fans , but regardless of album I could at least find enjoyment in half the album , if not the whole thing . This caused some troubles with some of the 70 's stuff which only had 4 or 6 songs , but hey . 2112 is an amazing album.Unfortunately this album just did n't grab me . For starters the production was a little too muddy , though I could overlook that with better songs . And that 's where this album really falls flat . The song writing is just ok at best . There 's nothing to capture one 's attention with most of them . They are n't really bad or anything , they 're just there . You have Caravan which started the album off to a decent note , but that being the first single , had I known , would have worried me as it 's only a decent song . Halo Effect is by far my favorite song on here . I love the acoustic guitars , and the rest of the band puts in a solid effort , beautiful song . Garden had nice acoustic guitars as well , but I think I was hoping for more reading how much others like this song . It 's still decent though.The album feels like a bunch of ideas they decided must go into the album without thought to how they 'd work together . One song has this random bluesy acoustic guitar piece which sounds really cool and all , but really does n't fit the song and just comes from out of nowhere , though probably the best part of that song . The vocal melodies are flat out boring and uninspiring . The guitar riffs , mostly are the same , though there are a few stand out riffs to be found . Headlong Flight has a great riff and awesome verses , setting up to be a great fast paced rocker , however the chorus which is n't that great completely changes the pace , and not in a way that works . The song gets ridiculously slow . I get songs can change pace and like many songs which do this , but this particular song it did n't work . Bu2b or whatever had the same problem . The verses were kind of groove rock and the chorus got all fast , in a way that did n't work for me.The main problem is this album is forgettable . I 've had to listen to it several times even to remember a lot of the songs , and even now I can only remember parts of some of them . I should n't have to listen to an album 15 times for something to grow on me . There should be a few songs which stand out imediately and there were n't , just a couple that later grew on me . It seems when Rush tries to put out an album of more than 8 or 9 actual songs , not counting instrumentals , they lose focus . If there 's another album in them I really hope they take their time with it and really focus on the songs rather than just slapping every idea they have together and hoping it fits . These guys are better than this.Overall this album felt like it was just all over the place with almost nothing worth coming back for . If you 're a Rush fanatic you 'll enjoy it . If you like Rush , but accept that not all their work is gold you may want to listen to it first , and if you like it then buy it .	-1
Ah ! Brian Regan , the bastian of clean comedy in America whether he 's family friendly , or not . The question of clean comedy vs dirty comedy and right and wrong is n't what goes on in my head and I pity those who think it 's about that ( and I know there are more than a few in his audience ) . There are funny comedians on both sides of the fence and Regan is squeaky clean which makes me look at him differently . Kevin James is largely clean and others are clean and lame , but what 's wrong with having a few jokes that do n't fly with little kids and when was stand-up comedy about universal appeal or understanding ? Taking these things into account I understand where Regan is coming from being from a middle class Protestant household with history in Mennonite . He strays from anything that would be impolite , crass , rude , or unappealing to anyone within earshot because the most impressionable and sheltering audiences run at the first sign of dissent , not to mention a dangerous tone of voice . This results in his comedy being akin to clown shoes , a prop that serves no purpose in the service of comedy . To others more accustomed to personalized comedy it comes off as less than honest even when he talks about himself or his family . To me , he 's not funny at all . Even comedians I ca n't relate to are funnier . It just seems that he boxes himself in , rather than being himself and in the process he ca n't reach profound comedy , or entertaining humor at all outside of this sheltered audience . If you 're an adult and you like Regan I have no interest in hearing your tastes apart from him , he 's that bad to me on this cd . This started it all and I 've seen his specials on TV thinking he must pick something funny off of the road and he 's always terrible , worse even . To those who love comedy and like to see clean done well , stay away from this man , he 's killing the game .	-1
That 's right , I said it . I love this album , and yet I still give it two stars . Let me explain why.I am rating this album as I would rate any legitimate album . I do this because I understand that Shatner was being completely serious about this album , and the dramatic interpretations of the two songs/poems/monologues fused together are supposed to symbolize the duality of man , and blah , blah , blah . I get all of that.But still , the album is horrendous . As you listen to it , you can not help but firmly believe that Shatner thinks he 's pulling off some great artistic feat with this album . However , he is wrong . Horribly wrong . The arrangement of each `` song '' is sub-par , the backing band of studio musicians on the album has no life , and then there 's Shatner himself . With his trademark delivery , Shatner leaves his indelible mark all over every track , and that 's really not such a good thing.This album would be utterly forgettable , if not for the fact that it is such a train wreck that it is an absolute must-have . Let me write that again in bold for the folks that may have skipped over this review : THIS ALBUM WOULD BE UTTERLY FORGETTABLE , IF NOT FOR THE FACT THAT IT IS SUCH A TRAIN WRECK THAT IT IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST-HAVE . I actually bought this CD as a British import twelve years ago for twenty bucks , long before it was in print on CD in the States , and even now , when I could have bought it for half the price , it is still worth every penny I paid for it all those years ago.You see , whenever I 'm feeling blue , I pop The Shatner into my CD player , and everything gets a little bit better . It never fails to bring a smile to my face , especially Mr. Tambourine Man and A Very Good Year.Honestly , this CD is glorious in it 's sheer awfulness . It is so good on such a low level that it has forced me to create a new word to fully describe it : Shatnerrific . You can not go wrong buying this CD . Trust me on this one . It 's my favorite music purchase ever . No , seriously . *Ever* ...	-1
This CD is without a doubt one of top 100 worst recordings of the 20th Century - and in that sense it 's a classic . Mel Brooks could n't attempt this . I have listened to 100 's of CD 's in my lifetime . I have never heard anything this bad.It 's a tour-de-force of horrible singing , banal melodrama , mindless `` poetry '' and shameless , unmerited conceit.I do n't buy the line that this was all an inside joke on the part of Bill Shatner . That 's just Trekkie spin . What you have here is one of the most blatant examples of a hyper-inflated Hollywood ego making a complete public fool of itself . If a normal person did anything like this , on the morning after they would seriously contemplate hara-kiri.Shatner 's vocal theatrics are a mockery of the acting profession - enough to make a person laugh themselves into a hernia or lose whatever they ate during the last 18 hours - except that the joke is on him . He actually thinks he is amazing even the angels with his talent . But no . His rendition of `` Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds '' probably earned him a 600 year stint in that part of purgatory reserved for airport lounge singers.All said , this CD is so terrible that it has one redeeming quality - it would make an excellent white elephant gift next Christmas .	-1
First - I love David Gilmour ... and believe he was more the 'sound ' of Pink Floyd than Roger . Upon reading reviews of this DVD `` David Gilmour in Concert 2002 '' , I bought it over the more expensive Royal Albert Hall DVD . Mistake . This one , though a quality performance , is not `` Pink Floyd re-visited '' and has ZERO songs from his first two solid albums from back in the 80s ( David Gilmour and About Face ) . It is a bunch of slow , 'On an Island ' type songs from I do n't know where and multiple versions of PF songs that all began to sound the same ... I had to fast forward several times . The redeeming feature of this DVD is the Extras . The DVD is 'only ' $ 10 , but I do n't see myself ever watching it again so ... not worth the money .	-1
When I saw this DVD I bought it without reading too much about it - shame on me . I love Pink Floyd and David 's solo work . In the endless debate of Roger Waters vs. David Gilmour my vote is always 110 % in favor of David Gilmour . From the front cover it was obvious that it would be scaled down a bit but I did n't expect it to be as scaled down as it is . David talks to the audience a little here and there which is nice . The bad part about it , however , is that he speaks so softly that you ca n't hear anything he says without turning up the volume quite a bit . I would guess that the music is played at twice the volume as his voice when he speaks to the audience.The intro sets the stage for what is to come : a very , very slow version of `` Shine On You Crazy Diamonds '' which is played again later in the set at more of a pace that Pink Floyd fans are used to . There are a couple times during the set when David plugs in the electric guitar for a guitar solo but throughout the set I found myself wanting to turn it off in favor of watching the `` Pulse '' dvd instead.Overall I was very disappointed and if it were easier and possible I would return it for something else . I watched about half of the concert before falling asleep a couple nights ago and sadly have very little interest in even finishing it . It pains me to rate anything by David Gilmour or Pink Floyd so low but for the benefit of others I rated it how I honestly feel .	-1
A good mixture of concert and short movie footage ! They were both visual and sound stimulating . Very good stuff that you will have to watch to believe in what I am trying to say .	-1
Are you people insane ? This is horrible , the music is good yes but the footage is bad and it 's hard to watch unless you 're high . The fantasy scenes are just boring and you 're thinking okay that 's nice now get back to the concert footage . Zeppelin fans should n't waste time with this , instead you should check out their other concert dvd because it 's way better than this .	-1
If you already own the DVD of this concert do not bother to buy this BLU RAY disc , the sound do not improve a bit . The sound on the regular DVD is the same , the picture quality arguably is a bit better . This is far from true HD Sound ... NOT RECOMMENDED .	-1
I must have seen this movie 20 times at the local theatre . Friday and Saturday nights at midnight they 'd play Rock n Roll movies . I have never been able to stay awake through the whole movie . I thought at the time it was because we were staying up past midnight to watch it and we were just to tired to make it to the end . So when I picked up the DVD and brought it home after not seeing it for so many years I thought & quot ; I 'm finally gon na be able to see this movie from start to finish & quot ; . I still fell asleep . This movie has not aged well . I LOVE ZEP . But this movie reminds me too much of Spinal Tap . The dream sequences ... ... ... Why are the there ? The band looks very bored . They also seem to take this whole 'rock star ' persona way to seriously . Spinal Tap was a spoof . This was not and looks like one . Long live Zep ... ... ... ..but you do n't need this DVD in your collection .	-1
First of all ... this is not a reveiw of the actual movie . Or pehaps it is . This has nothing to do with the sound quality , which is very , VERY GOOD ! This has to do with the DVD version ( and maybe the actual movie , although I do n't remember noticing it while watching it at numerous mid-nite showings so many many years ago ) . This is not my opinion ... .THIS IS FACT ! ! I am a guitar player ( for nearly 40 years ) , as well as a dabbler on the keys . If you are a musician , you must have noticed it . The sound is NOT ... .I SAY THE SOUND IS NOT IN-SYNC WITH THE VIDEO ! What amatuer let this slide by . There are many places where this is noticible . You can 's miss it . Plant bellowing out a howl ( like during RnR ) , yet for a split second , the mic is still near his waist ... it 's not anywhere near his mouth . I thought that this was just an overdub . But no because during the intro to Stairway , Page ( my beloved guitar GOD himself ) is doing his little riff on the 6 of his EDS and ... .my gosh people , the sound and video are no where near in-synch with each other . There are many other moments just like this . I ca n't believe Page let this thru the out door ( pardon the pun ) . I enjoy this concert . I do n't believe it deserves the bad rap it has recieved over the past 25-30 years or so . If you like live albums that have been totally redone in the studio , try Rush 's Exit ... Stage Left or Show of Hands . Live albums were ( I say WERE ) meant to be made in the raw ! ... mistakes and all . And there are many of them ( LEAVE THEM IN ... THIS IS LIVE BABY ) . Musically I rate this as a ( LIVE album ) a 5 star PLUS ! BUT THE AWFUL PRODUCTION , AS WELL AS THE NUMEROUS PLANT CROTCH SHOTS ARE A TERRIBLE DISTRACTION ... .1/2 star .	-1
After reading the reviews of the poor picture quality , I am wondering , is it worth getting the 2-disc outrageously priced set ? What is on the second disc ? I still have my VHS but heard they sunk up the stereo audio from the `` Bonfire '' Box and when it switches to spoken word in interviews , the audio is drastically reduced ? Help out another Bon fan ! Thanks	-1
I agree with the other reviewer that this is the best Giselle I have ever seen . The second act , one of the peaks of European culture , is perfection in this version : bathed in moonlight , the young maidens dead before marriage , dance a surreal accompaniment to the tragic love affair of the two principals . The whole hallucinatory effect is supported by the marvelous music of Adolphe Adam : the quintessence of banality . the acme of vacuity , but perfection in this context . An experience to view and review time and again . Utterly divine . I want to givbe it five stars but the Amazon site is defective on my computer and will only accept one for some reason .	-1
... but KISS actually hit it with Crazy Nights . Three videos from this album are three to many . If you own this I hope it was a gift , otherwise you were ...	-1
The quality of the VHS release is far superior to the DVD available in 2009 . The DVD is washed out . The VHS has much better color and image-focus.The content ? For me , this movie can be watched many more times than Help or Hard Days Night . Listening to the entire audio is fun too .	-1
I have everything that the Beatles ever put out on vinyl and yes , I own a copy of each of their films . That being said . The movie was filmed in Black and white and recolored , its broadcast on the BBC at premier , I believe was also black and white which was a total waste as the color aspect of the film is lost and hence its a snore fest.Everyone is so strung out or post trip that really its a total shambles as far as any perceived plot . The only scene that gave me a laugh was of John shovelling spaghetti on a plate . Otherwise , the music scenes of I am the Walrus and The Fool on the Hill were a total waste even if you had dropped a blotter to relate.I rarely post really really negative reviews , but in all honesty , save your money , this sucks in a supremely quantum fashion . It should be a one star , I gave it 2 because I love their music so much . Sure , everyone had taken acid or done drugs , thats not the issue . This is a rambling directionless film directed and edited in some futile hope that you get it and in reality there nothing to get , everyone basically trips their nads off and you have to see the genius in it . I dont.Even under the guise of Pop culture or pseudo surrealism , this is a big can of suck . I am upset on 2 levels , 1 ) I cant ever get the time back I wasted in my life watching this and 2 ) its just so very poorly made.Part of me wishes I could give negative stars . One Caveat , it is still better than Ishtar , and on Ishtar , I will say the only positive thing I could recall was that the movie was shown in an air conditioned room .	-1
The quality of this dvd is terrible . The movie is great having seen it in much better quality on the BBC . Not even an official release makes this a clear sign to stay away from this dvd . Wait a few more years for the offical release from Apple and when it is digitally remastered .	-1
Those who read this review are , no doubt , familiar with every word , note , and film frame of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR . In short , the DVD transfer is horrible . Granted , the original 16mm film was not a professional job either , but this DVD appears as if it was derived from a very poor copy of the Beatles ' film.I have seen MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR in many formats . Years ago I found a 16mm film copy in the library . I borrowed this print several times . The the picture was very clear , but the sound was poor . Later I bought a VHS copy through MEDIA . The original VHS copy was about the same quality as the film , except that it was convenient to play on a video cassette recorder . Still later I bought a `` remastered digitally enhanced '' VHS copy . The picture was about the same as previous editions , but the sound was greatly improved.Recently I bought the DVD release . I was somewhat concerned that the DVD did not display the Apple Logo , but I had heard that this film drifted into the public domain a few years ago . I was sadly disappointed at the quality of the DVD . Nothing was done to improve this copy of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR . The color is washed out , picture is grainy , and the sound is worse than the original 16mm film . About the only benefit of the DVD is that enjoys the semi-permanence of being on DVD and you can jump from chapter to chapter.As for the film itself , this was the Beatles first attempt -- outside of some of their music promos -- at making a film . It was designed to be for television , so it was captured on 16mm color film . The plot is simple : The Beatles and friends load onto a bus to take a sight-seeing tour of England . These tours were standard fare for Brits in the late 1960s . Along the way the passengers and crew of the bus encounter some odd scenery and situations . In between there are some great Beatles musical numbers.Okay , the film itself is not Oscar material . It is more like something you would expect from someone showing off a new home movie/video camera . However , it is classic Beatles . There was not much of a script for this movie and John , George , Paul and Ringo all took part in the production . Apparently all four Beatles were involved in the editing , though never at the same time . As such , the film took on conflicting directions depending on who was in the editing room . Paul even slipped in his solo `` Fool on the Hill '' promo from Southern France.We have all heard the legend . This film bombed on British television . It was broadcast in black and white . Later it was rebroadcast in color in a bad time slot . Worse yet , the film was blown up to 35mm and premiered in theaters . Still , it heralded the creation of Apple . All four Beatles would be involved in numerous other film projects and MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR was good experience.If you do not already have a VHS copy of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR , I recommend that you wait for Apple to re-release a restored copy . On the other hand , the DVD is affordable .	-1
I was so excited when I heard that there was going to be a Police concert DVD and I did not hesistate to buy it once it came out . I watched it immediately and it was a real let down . The people who filmed and edited this concert must have been drunk or stupid because they definitely did not capture the concert like they should have . First of all , what 's with all the shots of the audience ? The shot of the girl dancing during `` Message In A Bottle '' does not make sense at all , the shots of the audience grooving during `` Wrapped Around Your Finger '' are pointless , the shots of those weirdos waving to the camera during `` De Do Do Do , De Da Da Da '' are dumb , and the shot of some teenager dancing real fast during one of the last songs makes me want to go back in time and break the cameras that were used to film the audience . Okay , there should be maybe some shots of an audience for a concert DVD but 98 % of the focus should always be on the musicians . Next , why are there almost no shots of Sting playing the bass ? Did the camera people forget that he was the bassist of the Police as well as the lead singer ? The camera only seems to be interested in his head . The guy is an excellent bass player and the directors for some reason chose to ignore that . Only on the multi angle tracks along with a few others can you see Sting playing the bass . Another extremely annoying factor about the camera work is that the backing singers get way too much camera time . Even when they are not actually singing , they are still shown . Why would the directors and editors choose to show the backing singers dancing instead of the band playing ? I do n't get it . Other crazy choices for the filming include that stupid strobe effect on `` Spirits In The Material World '' and that slow motion thing on `` Tea In The Sahara . '' It 's a shame that such a great band has a concert DVD consisting of garbage . I only give it 2 stars for the sound ( great sound ) , the set list , and the multi angle tracks . Otherwise I would not give it any stars . Someone needs to come out with a much better Police concert DVD that is filmed the way it should be . I 'm sure there is other footage that exists . Otherwise Sting , Andy , and Stewart need to put the band back together so they could film some shows . Wishful thinking , I know . I hope the three of them are just as angry about this DVD as I am . Save your money or buy it used for $ 5 if it 's even worth that much .	-1
My toddler loves the other three WDW sing-along videos ( Campout , Beach Party and Flik ) . I rented this from the library and it seemed promising at first , but she lost interest by the 3rd song and went back to asking for Beach Party.As for me , I was born and raised in Orlando and went to Walt Disney World at LEAST twice a year from 1973-2003 . I am a Disney fanatic and I love the theme parks . And a lot of adults wrote positive reviews here about this video . So I figured there was no way I would n't enjoy this , but I have to say I really did n't ! It was ... hmmm ... well , tacky . It did n't bring back 'fond memories ' of my trips ; instead it seemed like a bad late night infomercial for some little rinky-dink attraction . This might partly be because it 's for Disneyland and not the Magic Kingdom , but they are n't THAT different . It seemed like its creators were so determined to make it seem like `` The Happiest Place on Earth '' that everything was WAY overdone , and everyone including the 'guests ' were overacting to the EXTREME for the video . It was clearly made in the late 80s or early 90s so the people looked goofier than Goofy . It would be great if Disney would do an updated , modern version of this and make it classier.Also - be aware there is a Haunted Mansion scene that is n't appropriate for kids under 5 .	-1
I first wanted to give this only one star . I saw it at a party when I was a little bit drunk and thought it was rather fun . But then I watched it again and could not call this movie anything but garbage . Reason for 2 stars : Its Zappa , nice guitar solo in `` Magic fingers '' , the naked lady playing with her boobs , and ... ehmm..cant think of more .	-1
he is neither here ... ..IMHO ... .if you want to enjoy some music related to & # 34 ; groupies & # 34 ; and the pursuit of & # 34 ; Zappaness & # 34 ; , get the album that was recorded live a the Fillmore East in 1971 . Hysterical and poignant , Zappa at his best !	-1
We were getting geared up for the Winwood - Clapton tour last year and thought it would be nice to check Traffic out live . I wish I would have saved the money as this was just terrible in every aspect - poor audio , poor video and a completely un-inspired and low on talent ( at the time ) Steve Winwood . Catch him later on as he actually could play additional riffs on his keyboard . this was embarrasing for anyone who thinks they remember Traffic , minus Dave Mason , who WAS the heart of that band . Sorry , Jim Capaldi .	-1
This is a great concert . The problem is the way it was filmed . The concert was shot using film . Whenever the camera passes in front of one of the stage lights it leaves a huge streak across the picture that lasts for a few frames . Really annoying .	-1
While the sets are detailed and impressive , the production lacks `` atmosphere '' . everything seems as it should but there is a clinical quality about it which makes it all a bit dull . Add to that an overly melodramatic performance that border on being comical.Worst of all is the utter poor video quality of the DVD . look elsewhere if your in search of aida for your dvd/bluray library .	-1
Eurotrash is generally applied as a term by US commentators to criticise adversely European Regietheater productions , We in Europe think of Eurotrash as signifying vulgarity , over blown , ostentatious show . As such this Aida is a prime example of Eurotrash . What is Aida about ? What does it have to say to us NOW ? Verdi 's seriousness of intent is lost in a sea of literalness , ridiculousness and vulgarity . Opera for those who believe opera is a show , without meaning for the 21st Century . This great work deserves the seriousness of attention we apply to Shakespeare . This is a totally empty spectacle with posturing puppets ( who can sing , albeit well ! )	-1
I thought this was going to be a concert . Too much talk , travel footage and very little music .	-1
Right off the bat the cover is n't even a shot of Jimi At Berkeley and its all downhill after that . I have several close up slides of the second show that could have been used . Why the estate passes on their vault of Hendrix filmed material and releases this is beyond me . Bring out the Royal Albert Hall , Atlanta Pop , Stockholm 69 , PLEASE . This latest release will not win too many fans . The estate has had 20 odd years to `` get it together '' and except for the box sets along with Isle of Wight and Woodstock , has failed miserably . Come on McDermott you were once a collector and fan . What Up ?	-1
The concert is very good . But the DVD is a region 2 DVD and I live in the USA . Wo n't play . I sent it back for a refund .	-1
I saw it second run - maybe in 1972.It might be a well made film . The music may be tremendous.Once I saw Hell 's Angels kill on film , it was not about the music or about the quality of the film . You see in the early seventies , I was tired of seeing death . We just had years of Viet Nam on network news . I did not wan na see any more.Now , we do not see the reality of war . We do see massive amounts of gore in commercial film . Too many people are used to see death in the multiplex or on cable . I avoid those films .	-1
Not this DVD , Video or whattever it 's on nowadays again ! ! ! ! ! ! ! It 's a documentary of a concert that went wrong , due to the Stones hiring The Hells Angels as security ! ! ! Now , How exciting can that be ? ? ! ! ! ! The Stones start playing , they have to stop , they start again , stop again , and so on , and so on.A good video ? Hell no ! Stones trying to cash in again ? Definetely !	-1
I borrowed this DVD from my local library , I was taken a back with the quality of this DVD , it looks like a crap video that is a shambles , The audio is reasonable in 5.1 plus the Doco is just ok , but the concert must be the worst vision I have seen on a DVD , How can David Bowie be happy with this visual display of inferior quality ? , I get cheesed off with having good AV gear to have to run this type of crap , and that 's what it is , CRAP ! ! I have videos that come up 100 % better , Why produce DVDs that dont qualify for this technology ? it '' s not the first and it wo n't be the last , DVD producers please do n't bother putting visual crap out on DVD , your transfers are unworthy of modern technology , if the Masters do n't scrub up for transfer forget it , although a lot of people cant see any difference , so be it .	-1
I had high hopes for this video as I love Hank Williams and think he was one of the last and best authentic country music people ( unlike the plastic , blow dry , plastic surgerized men and women faking it in Nashville today ) . Country music today has been declawed and de # @ % % @ # , as has Latino music - all in the name of money and Clear Channel radio programming formats . I wish I could agree that Sneezy does a good Hank but I found his performance to be only vaguely reminiscent of our boy . Sneezy does n't look like Hank except from a distance . His voice does n't sound like Hank to me . His singing lacks Hank 's straight from the heart charm , pain , and joy . The film is a bore and is cheaply filmed . If you can catch any of Hank 's filmed appearances , you will see how he just lights up a stage . A disappointment .	-1
This was a huge disappointment . This & # 34 ; Sneezy & # 34 ; really was n't up to the role . I 'm sure Hank Jr. or Alan Jackson or Travis Tritt ... any number of people could have done a much better job . He has no singing voice either ... a total loss ... I would n't recommend this to anyone ... .very poor .	-1
This is a barely adequate production of the great Mozart Opera.The spare stage settings create little of the `` Singspiel '' magic that this opera requires.Franciso Araiza is uninspiring as Tamino but other members of the cast are generally good - Kathleen Battle is appropriately girlish as Pamina , Kurt Moll provides some gravitas as Sarastro , and Manfred Hemm provides some energy and humour as Papageno.This production never springs to life and after a while one just sits there feeling bored.Sound and picture quality are OK .	-1
I just got this . I 'm a huge Black Sabbath fan as well as a Dio fan . I thought there would be a lot of good stuff from that period.There was some , but not enough.Most of it was interviews from people I did n't know were in the band.Part 1 of the Black Sabbath story was awsome . This part falls far short .	-1
I love Moody Blues , but did not enjoy watching this concert on my 55 '' Sony TV , because the quality was worse than VHS . I am really surprised that the production company used cheap cameras and use cheap editing equipment . The post production was finished using linear editing system , everything looks pixelated . If this would have been filmed 50 years ago , I would say its OK. As far as fans , they are still enjoying it , that 's why there are so many 5 star reviews .	-1
We know the boys were giving it their bloody all , based on everything we 've read about their farewell . Unfortunately , this production is nearly ruined by terrible sound , echoing all over the place , and then the abysmal camera work , which reaches a frustrating nadir when the stoned cameraman goes absolutely berserk with the zoom apparatus , wanking that thing for all it 's worth in an apparent attempt to simulate an LSD trip ( ? ) ( and , my god , the editor left it in ! ) Other than that the camera is content to crawl up the nostrils of the trio or examine their dental work.That being said , the interviews are rather amusing , with the lads innocently talking gear and technique .	-1
Much of what I could contribute has already been said about this DVD . The editors even had Clapton change from a 335 to a Firebird in the middle of a solo . I knew he was good , but seriously folks ! ! In spite of all the drawbacks , it is the most complete record we have of a Cream concert in a large venue . However , there is room for hope ! PLEASE , if anyone out there with the wherewithall will listen . Please record all nights of the upcoming Albert Hall series of concerts and release a box DVD set including every performance , plus rehearsal footage in a pristine , unaltered form using state of the art recording equipment ! ! This is the one and only way out of this disaster . What do you say ? we 're listening ... ... ... and waiting ... and listening .	-1
Cream was a great band . Their importance and influence in the rock world ( and jazz and blues , too ) ca n't be over-stated . I love these guys . Having said that , I must warn anybody who is n't aware of this movie - that it is one of the most horrible botch jobs in the history of rock documentaries . I think everybody from the director to the camera to the sound must have been awfully stoned . If you want to see a movie featuing Jack Bruce 's acne scars with psych-ay-dell-ik sperm overlays crowding the frame , and almost unlistenable muddled sound in the background , then this film is for you . Or perhaps you 'd like to see the camera zoom in and out on Clapton 's nose to the movment of his wah-wah pedal.I read in an interview that Clapton was so incensed when he saw this botch of a movie that he actually went looking for tony palmer . I can only hope he found him and soundly kicked his ass.The only plus are the interviews with Clapton and Baker . Baker comes across as incredibly stupid ( which he most certainly is n't ) , but it 's funnier than hell . And his drumming speaks for itself .	-1
this sounds terrible.does n't look too well either.the 2005 version is all one might need , it covers it all with passion and grace.time is fair .	-1
This DVD is strictly for fans of rock comedy , and fans of Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons who masqueraded as KISS from 1983- 1996 . I refer to these 13 years as the embarrassing years . The DVD clearly highlights how a 1970 's Super group became a parody of itself.Prior to watching Konfidential and Xtreme ... . make sure you watch Spinal Tap.Ace Frehley - No RegretsIn Ace 's book No Regrets he alleges that Gene Simmons is sex addict and that everyone who has worked with Gene in the past 25 years has either been fired or quit . Ace has the last laugh as he cites that KISS became Spinal Tap after his departure.Video 's : The video 's from 1983 - 1995 clearly tell the Spinal Tap story . I watched them in the way that one watches a horrific car accident . For Ace and Peter fans , this is the first `` official '' DVD whereby Paul , but mainly Gene , criticize them . Gene 's vulgarity really comes across in this DVD with lines like - `` she had an opening and I had a stiff proposition . '' Gene thinks this is quite funny as he pauses for dramatic effect.Spinal Tap - in that movie that band has a drummer problem whereas KISS has a lead guitar problemPaul and Gene puts Ace down and then proceeds to criticize ALL the other lead guitarists.Vinnie Vincent - Gene alleges that Vinnie quote `` hung himself as he was handed the keys to the kingdom. `` I do n't know what happended with Vinnie Vincent as Gene avoids any detail.Mark St John - Gene cites that Mark St John is a `` musician '' who plays too many notes . Anyway ... .. Mark St John 's hand blew up to the size of a watermelon on the eve of a European tour . He was dumped for Bruce Kulick.The 1996 re-union has NOT yet occurred . The DVD ends with Bruce Kulick in the band . .1 Star out of 5 ... .. due to the Vintage Footage AND the fact that Paul admits that Ace was a valuable contributor to the band.Prior to the KISS-ology DVD 's I would have recommended it for the vintage clips from 1974 - 1977 . As you can now view these clips on the Second KISSology DVD , there is absolutely NO reason to own this . I bought it by accident just prior to the release of The Second Coming DVD . More fool me . If you can borrow it from a book or video library do so .	-1
... but it just seems to me that $ $ $ $ is the driving force behind baby boomer , but particularly Beatles , reissues . This has never been released on video , to my knowledge , so it is an event . And it 's nice to get the bonus stuff . But I think the pricetag is out of line , priced too high just because they know they can get it.It just seems a shameless ripoff ( kinda like gas prices ) . I mean , these guys all donated their time , played for no pay , to benefit a country in need . This kind of greedy , self-serving pricing seems at horrible odds with the original intent of the concert itself . People say this was the Live Aid template . The Live Aid DVD came out last March , a 4 DVD set that is priced at half of what this set is.Something 's terribly wrong here .	-1
Sorry , but this has to be a dissenting opinion . As some of the other reviewers have noted , `` Superman and the Mole Men '' was later edited into a two-part episode for the George Reeves TV program , now rechristened as `` The Unknown People . '' Sorry , folks , but in this case the `` edited for TV '' version is a distinct improvement and for one reason : THE MUSIC ! The score used in the original movie is a pallid , third-rate job that does nothing to advance the action or to support the eerie , `` film noir '' feel of the camera work . But when the film was mixed down for presentation on TV , the show 's producers had the genius to replace the film 's soundtrack with some of the scariest , most vivid background scores then available . ( As a matter of fact , this weird and wonderful music - used over and over again as background music throughout the first , black-and -white season of the 1950 's `` Adventures of Superman '' TV show - has been helpfully collected on CD by the Varese-Sarabande label . You can order it right here , at Amazon.com ! The Adventures of Superman : Original Television Soundtrack ( 1950s TV Series ) ) Anyone who gets to know `` Superman and the Mole Men '' only through the original theatrical release with its substandard , tepid musical score will have no idea of how good the film really is , or understand how the effective use of great background music can turn a third-rate movie into a very good film . Luckily for everyone , the DVD release of the first season of 'The Adventures of Superman ' made both TV re-mix and original theatrical version of 'Mole Men ' available for comparison.Adventures of Superman : The Complete First SeasonTrust me , after seeing the TV re-mix , you 'll never want to watch the theatrical release again !	-1
By 1968 Julie Andrews was one of the most-loved performers of stage and screen , the original Eliza Doolittle of Broadway 's MY FAIR LADY , a Best Actress Oscar winner for MARY POPPINS , and the star of film version of THE SOUND OF MUSIC -- a movie that was so profitable Hollywood wags dubbed it `` The Sound of Money . '' 20th Century Fox wasted little time in developing a new property for their new star , and ( possibly under the influence of FUNNY GIRL , the great stage success that was set to film at about the same time ) reached back in time to tell the story of a theatrical legend : Gertrude Lawrence.It seemed like a winner . Gertrude Lawrence ( 1902-1952 ) was known as `` The Toast of Two Continents '' in an era when the term had an almost literal meaning , and the highs and lows of her extremely public private life were almost as dramatic as her career . Operating with an incredibly large budget and under the direction of Robert Wise , the bio-pic STAR ! seemed to have everything : lavish sets , incredible costumes , a truly great collection of songs , an epic running time , and -- of course -- Julie Andrews . What more could you want ? Well , an interesting movie would be nice.STAR ! opened with tremendous fanfare in 1968 and proved an instant fiasco . All the earnings of THE SOUND OF MUSIC were wiped out seemingly overnight , and with bankruptcy staring it in the face 20th Century Fox cut the film from three to two hours and rushed the film into general release as THOSE WERE THE HAPPY TIMES . As a result , the film holds the dubious distinction of being the only major Hollywood film to completely tank twice in major theatrical release.At the time , much of the film 's failure was laid at the feet of Julie Andrews . Gertrude Lawrence , her remarkable career , and her high-flying lifestyle were still well-recalled in 1968 , and Julie Andrews simply did not look , walk , talk , sing , or in any way , shape or form bear any resemblance to her . Seen today , however , this seems an unfair accusation ; it is very evident that the project was never intended as a recreation of Lawrence , and Julie Andrews is actually quite good within the very tight limitations imposed upon her . The real problem is the script , which goes nowhere at a slow crawl . Indeed , the single most dramatic event in the entire story is Lawrence 's financial bankruptcy ! Yes , you can enjoy the sights and sounds of STAR ! But the story is beyond boring : it makes you feel that you 're sinking slowly to the bottom of a sea of Jello . The DVD has been criticized for leaving out the few minutes of intermission material that accompanied the original release ; frankly , I ca n't see this as anything more than a mercy , for the less time spent here the better . As for the bonuses , they are okay -- which is to say that they are actually more interesting than the film itself . I 'll be generous and give it two stars for production values and musical numbers . But unless you are a diehard Julie Andrews fan , do yourself a favor and give STAR ! a miss.GFT , Amazon Reviewer	-1
Weather its a French Poodle or a mangy mutt . Star may be a French Poodle , but its still a dog . I dont understand all the raves for this film . Its easy to see why it tanked in 68 and I dont understand its cult following today . Yes , Julie ( miscast ) , is beautiful , sings well , oodles of production numbers ( way too many ) ; the clothes ! But where 's the story ? Star put the final nail in the coffin for road show pictures . A curiousity piece for those wondering what that era was like . But not a good example of it . Lawrence deserved better .	-1
Anybody that has been at , or perhaps should I say 'in ' , a santana concert certainly must remember it 's the atmosphere that whafts around the stadium that perhaps increases the heartbeat rather than just the music . I was concerned when I bought this disc that Carlos may just be doing a 'sell out ' or try to shove some non classic music down my throat.I was right , on both counts , sure he squeezed four of his best and clsssics into the middle of his concert with 'Black Magic W , Gypsy Queen , Oye Como Va ' , and 'Samba ' while the rest of the disc is jam packed with 14 ho hummers ... ..In my mind the standard for classic super group DVD 's still has to be Fleetwood Mack 's 'The Dance ' DVD ... ... You have to be a real hard core Santana fan and put up with his antics to enjoy this Santana DVD ... ...	-1
... the audio is EXTREMELY compressed . Not at all what you expect from DVD technology .	-1
The original run time for this movie is 92 minutes , but this 25th anniversary version is 89 minutes , yet no scenes are cut . How can this be ? Simply , the movie has been `` sped up '' by 4 % , which is what happens when movies are put on video in Europe due the difference in frame rate . It looks like what the geniuses who released this DVD did was , take the 4 % faster overseas version ( meaning the audio pitch is higher ) , and simply use that without first trying to `` reconvert '' it back to our system to get the correct time/speed . But wait , this is equally lame , we should n't need to convert from a previously converted format , as the U.S. format `` is '' the original format.Bottom line , this release is not any kind of remaster , it was simply stolen from a European release that was n't even that good . The best quality DVD version ever released for this movie ( to date of this review ) was the German release , the quality will blow you away . The only drawbacks for viewing in the U.S. is , you would need a multi-format DVD player for playback ( though your PC drive will work ) , and , you would have the 4 % speed hike . Most people wo n't notice the speed increase , but in music it is more noticeable.Get the German DVD if you can , it has both 2.0 and 5.1 audio , and pristine video quality in true widescreen . And it has the originally UNEDITED audio . Wonder if Lion 's Gate will actually do it right for the Blu-Ray release . ***** AMENDED FOR BLU-RAY REVIEW , READ BELOW : DO NOT waste your money on the U.S. blu-ray release , Lionsgate dropped the ball again , the quality is awful : colors are faded , and there is so much grain it makes no sense ... .the good news is , the German blu-ray on the Concorde label looks like it was made yesterday , and that is no exaggeration ... the colors will blow you away , but even better is the clarity and detail , it 's jaw dropping , even the background forest scenes are razor sharp . AND THERE IS NO GRAIN . And , Blu-ray high definiton video does n't have the 4 % speed issues that standard definiton DVD 's have . Also , The German Blu-ray is region free , so it will play on U.S Blu-ray players , except for the extras , which will not play at all as they are standard defintion.Below are the links for the German Blu-ray , and the German 3D version of the Blu-ray ; to help navigate through the german language , I found it helpful to match the pages with same U.S. amazon pages to see what options I needed to use to buy it : http : //www.amazon.de/letzte-Einhorn-Blu-ray-Arthur-Rankin/dp/B005FUO7D6/ref=sr_1_3 ? ie=UTF8 & qid ; =1364742928 & sr ; =8-3http : //www.amazon.de/Einhorn-Version-magnetischem-3D-Wackelbild-Blu-ray/dp/B0094M6DTC/ref=sr_1_5 ? ie=UTF8 & qid ; =1364742928 & sr ; =8-5	-1
The Last Unicorn is one of my favorite animated films of all time and I have waited years for this movie to be released on DVD . The soundtrack is wonderful too , and I listen to it often . You can imagine how excited I was when I got the Amazon notification that it would finally be available , so the movie itself gets 5 stars but this edition gets 1 star and deserves nothing more . This has to be the absolute worse picture quality I have ever seen on a DVD ... heck the VHS copy has to be better than this . The sound quality is terrible too , sounding almost like a record , and there are absolutely no extras . Not to mention that the movie was only released in full screen , but I could have dealt with that had the rest of the DVD been done right . Artisan/FHE did such a shoddy job with this DVD that I will be very careful when picking up anything else from them in the future . I tried to return my copy , but of course since the seal was broken , they could do nothing about it so I resold it online and have ordered a no region copy of the German release , which looks and sounds great ! I recommend anyone wanting this movie to consider that for themselves . Maybe Artisan/FHE will take the hint and actually give us some credit by releasing a version of The Last Unicorn worth paying for .	-1
This is the poorest excuse for a video ! What 's the Temptations without David Ruffin , Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams ? This video breaks my heart . I 'm truly heartbroken !	-1
Elvis Presley 's 68 Comeback Special is a poor concert . Many songs are turned into medley 's ( who only wants to hear a partial song ? ) . Also Elvis 's performance just is n't anygood , and the setlist leaves a lot to be desired . Not enough big hits , and I hate the gospel medley , awful !	-1
OK , let 's get this out of the way , the ELVIS ( '68 Comeback ) is the finest TV special ever presented on American television . So why the 1 star ? The editing in this version of the show is appalling , such lazy dilettantes . Every time there is a cut from one scene to another there is a still shot that moves from left to right and then the action resumes . It is grating . The show cuts from sit down performance to stand up and back and forth , all edits being telegraphed with the aforementioned still shot , stop and go routine , it is a real hack job.I own the 74 minute version put out 15 years ago and the editing follows the original broadcast . When they can , they put in extra footage at the appropriate time ( sit down is added to sit down performance , standup to standup so there is a continuous flow ) . The edits can be made from scene to scene and the original fade to black for the commercials are maintained . In addition they edited out Blue Christmas for crying out loud , what 's up with that ? Also on the cutting room floor is the little funky rhythm guitar part that immediately follows the intro Guitar Man and the audience clapping , hey remember the part where Elvis gives that sly smile and says , `` I think I 'll put a strap on this and stand up '' ? , remember his deadpan delivery of `` Man I just work here '' , Good thing for your memory ` cause it 's gone , cut out in favor of those imaginative edits.For the record to edit from scene to scene , if the action ca n't be done smoothly , you can always insert an audience shot and then back to Elvis , it 's called ` editing ' , people . The picture and sound are otherwise fabulous , it looks the same as the BOX set that I also own , I was hoping to get a version of the performance with extra black leather footage , but I was assuming the editing would be handled by professionals who would try to maintain the spirit , look , and vitality of the original while adding to the show . They ended up subtracting from the overall viewing pleasure . By editing out the Elvis dialog , they 've removed the soul of the presentation , the special was all about getting Elvis back in front of a live microphone but also to humanize him , show his gifted sense of humor . What a drag .	-1
We have nearly one dozen ELMO DVD 's for our toddlers ; this is their Least favorite and by far my worst as well . Very above their heads as far as content , wherease the ELMO 'S WORLD DVD 's cater to little kids and their like and dislikes . The Noodle Brothers are a real favorite and they do n't even make an appearance in this one ! The singing and dancing is fine if you 're looking for a `` Broadway '' show but for plain educational fun and games , this is not the one to buy ... stick with any and all ELMO 's WORLD tapes/dvd 's .	-1
I finished watching THE SECRET OF NIMH . Do n't worry : their secret is safe with me . By the end of the movie , I still had no idea what NIMH is . I assume it 's some nasty lab that does nasty things to rats to make them intelligent . But they also seem to be exterminators . And unless I dozed off and missed it , they never explained what the letters N.I.M.H . stand for . They 're written in upper-case letters , so probably they stand for something.The only characters I found remotely interesting were the owl , the cat and the crow . ( I did like the kid calling the crow a turkey ; that was cute . ) It was a delight to hear John Carradine 's voice again . He must have been at death 's door when that was made . Dom DeLuise was fun . Elizabeth Hartman , whoever she is , had no personality whatsoever . She came across as a total wimp . Just at the point where she might have developed into someone interesting , the movie ended very abruptly with the two crows forming patterns in the sky with their string . Huh ? Did they run out of film at that point ? Or money ? Anyway , the watercolor backgrounds were pretty.There are many things in the movie that I though were unsuitable for kids , and the pacing is so slow and meandering that I ca n't imagine kids being interested . However , that 's only my opinion .	-1
Awful CD . Aerosmith are one of the most overplayed and overratedrock bands of all time behind the even worse , AC/DC . The singerjust screams , this is n't music , this is just noise . I mean theonly good song is Janie 's Got a Gun , everyelse spit . This musicis trash , throw it away and do n't buy it again.Get Your Wings is all you need from this overrated band .	-1
This disaster epitomizes all that is wrong with corporate sellout rock music . Aerosmith is responsible for some of the greatest rock of the 70s , but here they hired some professional writers and set a torch to their storied legacy . Crazy , Amazing , Crying , Blind Man - each is rewrite of the other and they all belong on a Cher album . Seriously . They have nothing to do with rock n roll . Aerosmith had a FEW decent tracks from this time period ( FINE , Young Lust , The Other Side , geez I 'll even say that What It Takes was ok for a ballad ) , but the rest of this album is pure schmaltzy vegas pablum . Man , even the cover looks like it was whipped together in 3 minutes . And come on - how stupid is the title ? `` Big Ones , get it ? Har har har '' . Hey , if you know these songs and you love 'em , then more power to you and have fun with this album . Anyone else who wants to expereince the real Aerosmith should start with Rocks . Aerosmith : No shame .	-1
The foursome got in trouble doing this movie . The slapstick group was n't that funny in this film . Guns do n't belong in a Monkee 's movie .	-1
Okay . Let me get the contradiction started . I love the artists , the selections are interesting , and the performances top-notch . So why am I giving the DVD two stars ? Keith Jarrett 's annoying habits . Jarrett accompanies his own piano-playing by humming and snorting his improvisations . Imagine a Warner Brothers cartoon version of a bee humming a song , and you get the idea . I 'll be the first to admit that I found ( find ? ) the late Glenn Gould 's audible humming on all his recordings more than a little charming . But Glenn was more subtle - and in key , something Jarrett can not quite accomplish . All the positive things the other reviewers have said are on the money . There is a lot that is good about this performance/DVD . But I question whether their hearing ( or system ) is up to par if they can ignore this serious shortcoming . I 've tried several times since I received my copy in the mail to sit down and enjoy this recording . But this annoyance is too much to bear .	-1
it could have been funny without the use of vulgar language but the comedian used a lot of cursing and foul words as a crutch to make his comedy . what a pity . the use of foul language means you do n't trust your talents in making people laugh .	-1
Bland ramblings . It seemed funny at the time . . .and the times have changed . Try another disc and forget this one .	-1
1 star is to dull but five are to hot- maybe not=and comon will this review make or break your decision ? ? Oh then buy it . what they dont tell you is its 2 discs 1 is mostly post waters stuff and the other is mostly DSOTM , It sounds great and if your worried about how it looks then maybe you should be wasting your money on a music DVD Im sure you dont need me to tell you about The Pink Floyd sound as they were formerly called .	-1
What a great show in 1994 ! I can hardly wait for the DVD to come out 12 years after the show . Maybe that will be 14 years after ... or later than that.Pulse ( Doctor ... there 's no pulse ! ) is just so disappointing by its absence . Amazon , EMI , Pink ( gray ) Floyd just are n't satisfying the fans . We are being played with.All in all its just so disappointing .	-1
Why people buy this ? I dont know.This is a bad dvd.Buy Roger Waters dvd `` in the flesh '' ; best music dvd ever.Dont buy PULSE dvd . This is fake dvd . The first part is some new stuff from pink floyd ( extr bad ) The second part ( like tribute band ) WARNING ! ! ! ! ! DONT BUY	-1
Mariah Carey has long been looked at as one of my idols . I thought how she was doing something that she loved and did n't worry about having to & quot ; lip sync & quot ; , due to the fact she has a marvelous voice . I was wrong . Mariah Carey was obviously & quot ; lip syncing & quot ; in this video . All of the songs sound just as they did when they were released . I begining to think she has lost her confidence .	-1
I 'm not the sort to give things a bad review because it is 'cool and trendy ' . Way too old for that . But I have to say that I am glad I checked this video out at the rental store before buying.Really it 's quite bad . Not that the dancing is n't phenomenal ( Michael rules ! ) , but it lacks soul . Hubby and I like Celtic music -- old `` Shepherd 's Hey '' fans -- and we get to see Celtic dancing locally ( though amateur ) and we both found this video disappointing.The principal problem is the 'homogenization ' of the singing . It is sort of Celtic music for elevators . The second problem is the Flamenco dancer . Having seen a top rank group from Spain at Wolftrap , I have to say that this lady has got no 'attitude ' and the music ... . please , do n't get me started.Two Stars . Could have used a plot . Could have used some 'edge ' to both the singing and dancing . Lots of people adore this video but if you are a fan of traditional Irish dance and song , you might want to rent first .	-1
This is dated material . I prefer the later dvd 's like Bridges to Babylon . I rented this a went thru it in about 15 minutes . Not a keeper .	-1
Want to have nightmares ? Well , then get this DVD.What was the Lyon Ballet thinking of ? ? ? ? ? Copellia is a very gentle , charming wisp of a ballet . A light touch is essential . Delibes score is light and delicious.All of that goes into the trash can . Much of the music is cut , this version of the `` ballet '' is set in a seedy urban setting.There is almost no dancing . Swanhilda hardly exists except todo some quasi-ballet moves in combat boots while munching an apple.The horror really begins in act 2 . Dr Copellius is able to produce a never ending series of Coppelias , they emerge froma movie projector . All have red dresses , spike heels , and blondwigs . They seem to be both male and female underneath the oppressive costuming . And that 's pretty much where the `` concept runs out of steam . There is a little more perfunctory action , instead of Swanhilda doing some of the doll specialty dances , Dr Coppelius and Franz do them instead . Why ? What did this gentle ballet do to deserve this ?	-1
Pairing Elvis Presley with Nancy Sinatra may have sounded good on paper , but there is no chemistry on celluloid . In all fairness , not even Ann-Margret could have redeemed `` Speedway . '' There are a few good songs ( especially Elvis ' classic `` Let Yourself Go '' ) and the stock-car footage is fairly enjoyable . Otherwise , strictly Formula One . Released in June 1968 , `` Speedway '' gave little indication of the triumphant Presley comeback just around the corner .	-1
I did not like this video at all . I expected to see a good documentary full of rare and hit videos , and all we get to see is lengthy interviews and the bee gees showing their homes . The best part is when we see the group singing Massachusetts in the sixties , if only for less than 15 seconds . Thats all !	-1
Fleetwood Mac , unless you are a true fan , really puts on a senseless , energy-drained show here that you 'll sicken of faster than a can of Gummie Worms at the State Fair . And State Fairs , indeed , are where this group ought to be playing ; right next to Whitesnake and Rick Springfield and the demolition derby and blue ribbon goats.Buckingham gets his ya-yas out a couple times on lead guitar , but other than that , the ladies sound old , the bass player John just stands there ( like he has for his entire career ) . Christine still looks youthful ; an unsung MaryAnne next to Stevie 's more often photographed Ginger . Christine remains a comely British school marm ready to spank your wrists for looking up her skirt , so that 's one redeeming feature . Yet that small pleasure is offset by Mick 's still googly eyes and the 1980s vest . Thanks for putting a camera right by Mick so that I can get scared out of my easy chair every time he stares those cue balls at the camera ; nice touch for Halloween.I wish I could say that Fleetwood Mac are rockers , but alas , they are little more than Lawrence Welk on steroids . Sure , Do n't Stop pushes the metronome to 40 mph from Fleetwood Mac 's usual school zone 20 mph pace , but seriously rip-snortin ' rock and roll this just ai n't , brothers and sisters . No matter how much Dolby 5.1 Surround and DVD fog-filtered quality you throw at this show , the music remains elevator quality drivel . The passge of time has , in my opinion , shown the Mac 's music to be thinner than the veils around Stevie 's midsection paunch.Pass on it .	-1
I like this band a lot , but this DVD is a rip off . The sound is muffled and absolutely horrible . The footage is ok , but I could n't get past the sound problems . I would definitely stick with the live cannibalism DVD .	-1
Clearly , the producers of this DVD meant to mislead . The cover of the DVD shows the original album cover suggesting that it is a visual equivalent of the album . Please read the cover carefully . It is a quickly put together documentary of the times surrounding the making of the album . Too much time is taken up showning closeups of the of photographic stills that are already on the original album cover and liners.Much time is spent describing the breakup of the relationships.Some of the new performances of the classic songs are again , quickly put together and does n't provide additional insights.Hastily produced DVD with a misleading cover to cash in on unsuspecting fans .	-1
I bought this hoping that the promised songs on the back of the box would be the videos or `` promotional short '' versions songs I had seen on the internet . They were floating around Windows Media player when they were promoting the re-release of Rumours with extras and demos . They were indeed the cuts I was looking for : Fleetwood Mac jamming live versions Rhiannon , You Make Loving Fun , and Dreams . Filmed in 16mm on what looks like their touring stage running through impressive live renditions of these tunes , I yelped with joy that I had these chestnuts on DVD . Unfortunately , on this disc they are present as small samples of the various songs , and cut down to about 30 seconds each . More than enough to tease the viewer but not enough to satisfy . Apparently the producers of this documentary felt that we would be happy to sit through lots of inerview segments on the making of Rumours , but not fantastic footage made at the time of Mac playing the songs . Having seen them , I now realize what a great band they are ( and were ) live , but I wish they hadnt snipped down these awesome videos for this release . Dangit .	-1
Please release something better than this on DVD . ANYTHING ! ! ! !	-1
We bought this DVD for five bucks , and I think we paid for the entire production . My son is eleven , and he enjoyed the book . Of course adjustments are made for teleplays , like the removal of a character or a changed ending , but it was so laughably awful in acting , costume , script and overall production values , that we were never frightened , and we only laughed in sheet derision . Avoid at any cost . My nine-year-old daughter says , `` I 've seen cartoons scarier than this ! ''	-1
& quot ; Yessongs & quot ; is basically a very poor film of a great band in a good concert . If you are a Yes fan , you will probably want to view & quot ; Yessongs , & quot ; especially if you never saw the band live . I saw the band live about 5 years after this concert was filmed , and not much had changed . More of a light show , more keyboards for Wakeman , more great tunes , but basically the show was unchanged. & quot ; Yessongs & quot ; opens up with ( a somewhat slower version than the studio version of ) & quot ; I 've Seen All Good People. & quot ; It 's a good start to the concert , featuring the skills of all of the members . Jon Anderson 's unique voice , although not captured as well here as on any of their albums , comes through as well as the sound quality will allow . Chris Squire 's bass work and vocals show why he was an integral part of the group . Wakeman has a few good moments , but mostly is hidden behind his huge sequined cape . The show really belongs to Steve Howe and his incredible guitar work . Especially during the first half of the concert , Howe is the primary focus . Here we see one of the most talented and overlooked guitarists of the 1970 's . Most of the music itself is very good , except for the & quot ; Wives of Henry VIII & quot ; which is all Wakeman . Part of what made Yes great was the uniqueness of their sound , the feeling that they were playing music from another world . The sounds were great , but they were ahead of where the video/audio technology was at that time . In the year 2001 , we are used to well-produced video , great effects , and digital audio . Unfortunately , none of these elements are present in & quot ; Yessongs. & quot ; I would really like to find out if the band was filmed in their later years with a better video/audio set-up . Until then , the best way to experience Yes is to put on one of their CD 's , sit back , and close your eyes ...	-1
I was really disappointed in this . First it is only 74 minutes long . YES played in 1972 for about 3 hours when you saw them . This video has crappy sound and visuals . You get about four songs taken out of a concert and that has no context . A real rip off .	-1
Disclaimer : my copy is region B and not purchased through Amazon , but rather through an Australian retail outlet . That said , I am staggered at the asking price for this sub-par Blu-ray on this website and I must agree with the other two reviewers . The 5.1 mix is very disappointing , I think I got more out of it by using the ProLogic ll setting on my Pioneer receiver . I ca n't even access the `` restored mono mix '' , the disk case actually says that it is NOT included , despite the included 2012 trailer stating that it IS on the disk . What a selling point - here 's what your disk DOES N'T have on it ! ! On the doco Steve Howe says that the mix on the film was done brilliantly but this sounds like it was played back in an aircraft hangar and re-recorded by a bootlegger . As for the video , the trailer shows the film to be in 16:9 but clearly that 's not how it plays back . I suspect it is just cropped anyway so we probably are n't missing anything , but to the manufacturers , do n't mislead people , please . I ca n't comment on accessible video resolution as I do n't have a HD television . The film restoration was n't too bad , I know that there was n't much lighting to work with and this is probably as good as it gets.In conclusion , fair enough that you ca n't make a silk purse out of a sow 's ear but as consumers we deserve to be given more honest information about what we are buying . Marginally better video than the original , and a botched surround mix is hardly anything to get excited about in a marketing campaign , and Howe , Squires and Dean wasted their time making the doco . Another annoyed fan .	-1
Muti 's performance is acceptably & quot ; Mozartian & quot ; - and the singers do justice to the roles . The production is what one might call & quot ; opera house standard. & quot ; However , the video rendition is atrocious - perhaps the translation from European to American video standards was & quot ; too much & quot ; - the images are & quot ; jumpy & quot ; and erratic- it 's distracting in the extreme . Turn off the monitor and listen to the performance .	-1
The main attraction of this DVD is the chance you do n't get these days - to see Domingo not on vocal autopilot . Behrens may not be Tebaldi but she was a fine actress and Tosca gave her a chance to shine . The problem is MacNeil 's vocally threadbare Scarpia . By this stage his & quot ; singing & quot ; was simply terrible ( pitch problems , dry sound , no legato phrasing ) . Several other baritones would have been a far better choice but , then , most Met & quot ; old timers & quot ; know that backstage politics has far more to do with casting than talent . A better choice is the Kabaivanska/Domingo/Milnes video . Wait for it to come to DVD .	-1
This is a reissue of Prime Cuts with bonus material on a 2nd disc . The first disc/edition was good but Alice speaks of the original band as if they were dead , not bothering to include them in this retrospective except in the 3rd person . The 2nd disc on the reissue seems to rectify this by adding new footage of the original band being interviewed , or does it ? ? ? To view the 2nd disc material you need to play some stupid snakes and ladders game by rolling some on screen dice with your remote buttons . This is absolutely insane and is an absolute nightmare . I just want to watch the damn video ! ! ! There are a few tips on various on line Alice Cooper fan web sites on how to bypass some of this madness but if your DVD player is not configured like the tips require , you 're out of luck.I was trying to time the dice rolls and chapter skipping on my remote and I could hear my DVD tray spinning and agonizing trying to keep up with my remote . I just want to see the video ! ! ! Well my expensive DVD/Player/Recorder broke . Trying to make this stupid game work broke my DVD player/recorder.Maybe the conspiracy stories of Alice and his manager trying to erase the history of the original band is true . `` OK we 'll give em some interviews with the old band but just let em try and view it . Evil laughter ... ha ha ha ha ha ! ! ! ''	-1
Mara Zampieri , is the worst singer I have ever heard on the La Scala stage in a Dvd production . I am not being bitter and spiteful , she simply ruins it . I have watched the show with freinds , and we have to stop , because Zampieri seems like a bad joke . The tone is very very thin and shrill . The vibrato has no vibration , wooden with no roundness . The singing is sharp here and flat there , and in most incidental singing there is no spin at all . I can barely watch aby of it , and It spoils a great production . What is really weird , is that she is a first class actress , and and creates a fabulous picture of Minnie ... oh wellTo proceed , Juan Pons is a fabuous Rance . His Rance has a bit of Tonio in him . Big , ugly deformed , lonely , and sympathetic . This is not your gun slinging , tobacco chewig rance , this is your selfish , hurt and twisted rance . I always enjoy Pons and his charachterizations and his yelly and unique voice.Domingo owns this part , and will own it until he finally retires ( he has not yet taken it from his rep and it will most likley be the last Italian verismo part he gives up . ) His tone is just a strong as it was 9 years ago and one year later , and there is little to say . His the great ramirez head to toe.I could not help notice that between the two dvd Fanciullas this one seems to have the weaker supporting cast , but that is mere speculationIf you are buying this production , dont say you were n't warned about Zampieri .	-1
This is a Rossini serious opera and it is subject to the usual problems of long arias accompanied by little action . This makes it hard to make the production visually interesting during these long arias . The scenery and acting seem okay and sort of in style , but the basic plot is of little interest . What this means is that if the opera production is to succeed , the singing must be superb and arresting . Ellen ( June Anderson ) sings adequately though with some annoying repetitive mannerisms . Her lover Malcolm ( Martine Dupuy ) , a cross dressing mezzosoprano role , is really quite good . But what has kept me from watching the whole opera is the horrible male singing . These three singers ( two tenors and a baritone ) epitomize all that can be done to discredit opera . They bellow , wobble out of control and ignore the pitches to be sung ( I think ) so that there is no sense of a vocal line . I simply ca n't watch the whole opera and will surely donate this DVD to someone who just wants to know how the plot unfolds .	-1
What a disappointment ! The very first DVD that I decide to buy is a complete stinker . The video quality is marginal , like a copy of an old videotape . The sound quality is terrible : ranging the gamut from muffled to slightly distorted vocals because of a too-loud transfer . But that 's not the worst of it ... after you suffer through it all and think you 're finally going to enjoy the last video which is & quot ; Sweet Dreams ( Are Made Of This ) & quot ; , they start rolling credits over the video ! Would it have killed them to wait three minutes for the video to end before rolling the credits ! Obviously a rush job designed to make a quick buck , this deserves to be left on the shelf ! ( Fortunately , I was able to return it and bought Gloria Estefan 's & quot ; Do n't Stop ! & quot ; instead . Although the music 's of a different style , it shows exactly how a music DVD *should* be put together : crisp video and audio , and lots of extras . )	-1
This concert dvd is so awful it 's almost comical . I ca n't believe all the positive reviews . A good portion of the concert is simply close up photos of Stevie when she was n't in a stupor . Why do you think the producer of this video did that ... there 's a good reason because she was in very tough shape during this time.I 'm guessing Stevie previewed this dvd & decided it was time to clean up her act .	-1
Just watched this and I had to laugh at how mediocre this performance was . For all the windmills and other gyrations by Pete Townshend the music doesnt rock very hard . Keith Moon looks bored and Daltrys vocals are flat . If this is one of their greatest shows they are very overrated .	-1
Did not like this at all . I have heard some of their stuff and thought I would try a concert . I would not go to see them . Picture quality is poor too !	-1
Dear GunsN'Roses fans , I exchanged this DVD and the 2nd copy had the same problem as the first . The audio has these high and low points . The volume on a few of the videos went from the volume I had my television set on , then it went down to a lower volume on it 's own , then back up . It 's a shame because I would really like to have these videos on DVD , however I will be returning this 2nd copy and demanding a full refund . If you bought a copy of this DVD and the audio is n't messed up , hang onto it because you 're lucky . I did notice after the fact that there are some other reviews from people that had the same problem with their copy . So buy at your own risk. ( ... ) : Exchanged once again because refund was refused . Same problem with 3rd copy . DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE A SURROUND SOUND SYSTEM ! ! Save yourself the trouble , time and money .	-1
Of course I buy every Jimi Hendrix record , dvd , etc but when it comes down to Rainbow Bridge I start to get frustrated at a film that could have been good but really was not ... ... ... .The rumor has it the Rainbow Bridge concert was supposly stolen from the directors and now does not have its place in full format . This Rainbow Bridge really does not deserve to put Hendrix on the cover the reason they have him on the cover is to take your money . I bought this being very excited to see Hendrix on the cover ! Wow I thought this Maui concert would be good until the long movie came to the end their was uncomplete hendrix material.As soon as the concert beings Hendrix starts with Hey Baby the vocals sound really bad and it seems like the recordings is really garbled sound quality wise . Then hendrix plays Foxy Lady which is really bad . Then their is all uncomplete material includings a short minute of Red House , and more ! ! ! ! ! I was really disapointed having to got put through 125 minutes of hippies really no story ! ! ! ! The DVD is similar to the VHS I have both ... ... the DVD has better picture quality . But I really think this DVD is a way to take your money like I said before im sorry because I really love all of the hendrix dvd 's but this one really is bad both in and out . Dont let the cover fool you !	-1
Metallica did this specific show to film for a video , so did they choke or what ? Most of the renditions on this video are lackluster and butchered . And what the is the deal with them only play two and a half minutes of `` Master of Puppets '' . The band does do better on the second have of the show , but 50 % , even 60 % effort is unacceptable , especially for a video.Pros : The second half of the show is much better than the first . It is still Metallica live.Cons : They sure did choke or something because some of the songs are brutal and almost painful to watch.Final Thoughts : Save your money and buy `` Live Sh*t Binge and Purge '' or `` Cliff 'Em All '' , both of which feature far better performances unless you need to have all of Metallica 's videos .	-1
RIP Lou . I always loved this concert . But there is two different versions of the dvd this one and one by lightyear . If this is the one the sound is muffled all the way through . I do n't know where they got their source from . And on top of it they cut out some of Lou 's dialogue when he does Dirty Harry for instance . I found on you tube a dvd transfer that 's the lightyear one but it was not uploaded with 720p . But the sound is better and the dialogue is intact . So this whole situation is just messed up . But a awesome concert . As Lou said at the end that was short and delicious . The video in HIFI is the best way to go anyway it was videotaped for this format and is more sharp in picture and sound.FRANKLY THESE VERSIONS ARE ON A LOT OF COPIES I THINK THEY ARE BOOTLEGS .	-1
The voices are OK , but there 's no feeling like in the previous concerts , and i do n't feel completely satistied after each viewing . The medleys are the best , and the production below the Eiffel Tower looks awesome.My problem after seeing this was the edition . The opening is so cold and unatractive , and everything goes so fast , that i lose the attention , altough the arias are interesting ... Good concert , but looks unatractive .	-1
Already purchased DVD , same quality ... This under the title blu ray is misleading . Either converted it fully to HD both video and audio or do n't bother with it at all.SD Blu Ray = Half Job .	-1
I have the SD version of this concert . I bought this DVD because I am an avid Bee Gees fan . However , when I read the cover on the DVD , it read , SD BluRay ... .what is THAT ? What it is is BS ... The label reads that it is enhanced SD ... what is THAT ? In short ... if you have the SD version of this concert , DO NOT BUY THIS..You will find that it is a waste of your money ... Yes , it does add DTS ... ... ..but let me tell you this ... .I push my music through 5,000 dollars worth of Klipsch and Marantz surround equipment , and I ca n't tell a bit of difference in the audio from the 5.1 that is on the SD DVD , and the supposed DTS on this one ... The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 0 stars is that it IS the BEE GEES , and it is a magnificent concert..	-1
Why 5.1 sound on an audiance recording ? The performance is not bad however to fully enjoy Yes you need quality sound and this DVD has none.Do n't waste your money on this DVD .	-1
for nostalgia freaks only , I could barely sit through this , parasitic use of a brand name to sell amateurish 'product ' .	-1
Awful ... .poor recording ... poor concert ... uninspired ... razor deep ... the worst thing to come out of Philadelphia since those choking Eagles ... for Danschamdroza and the like ... shame on the company that produced and sold this ... prog robbers .	-1
Well another one of my first dvd purchases ... I found this concert very poor ... it did nothing for me ... the sound quality was poor , The set on stage was quite good but lacked the final sparkle , Janet 's performance was glitzy ... but sadly something was missing ... my advice is puchase Janet 's later DVDS ...	-1
I must have missed it but this was an area 2 version , the seller agreed to take it back .	-1
My favorite opera . The greatest music . Excellent singing and orchestra and conduction . I already have the superb B & ouml ; hm / Fischer-Dieskau / Janowitz / Mathis / Prey / Troyanos recording if that is all I want . But opera is also a VISUAL medium . This production : the scenography dull , the wardrobe prosaic , and the fourth act a total turn off . It is supposed to take place in a garden , not in what looks like a bunch of falling pier supports . Might as well have filmed it on a garbage dump .	-1
We want a high quality DVD performance with Dave ! ! ! This DVD is crap .	-1
This movie features ( most of ) the soundtrack of the best recording of Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk available . The film which was ( twenty odd years later ) slapped on top of that brilliant sound recording , served little other purpose than as a vehicle for once-locally-famous Czech soft porn actress and media-slag ( Hrubesova ) .It 's so tacky and has such a cheesy video-look that it makes the sound recording seem mediocre , where taken on its own , it 's brilliant . Shostakovich 's opera includes some violence and sex which does appear on stage in live performances . In this film it looks like some sort of pseudo-artsy and highly unbelievable soft porn flick . To give an example , the fat woman who gets raped ( they show it with dim warm lighting ) acts like she is being tickled with a feather , which is not the idea that the score portrays . There are also a lot of very '90 's looking men with really the sort of buffed symetrical appearance you get from working in a gym , and not the rugged look you 'd have among people who perform manual labour all day . Or in the bedroom scene with Katerina and Sergei - their textbook writhings allow embarrasing glimpses at the one part of Sergei which should ( judging by Hrubesova 's movement ) be most 'involved ' , but which we clearly see in an entirely different condition and nowhere near where it would have to be to cause the effect she is displaying . You can also see a little piece of cloth between them sometimes , when clearly nothing of that sort is meant to be there . Fair enough , the cloth is there even if you do n't see it , but the fact that all this is shown makes their 'beast with two backs ' act seem ridiculous and insulting . It 's actually a matter of bad editing ( and bad taste ) . It does n't add up , and even absent-mindedly making little mental notes of these inconsistencies is a somewhat unpleasant experience , again , especially because what the music itself conveys is so clearly real.As another viewer with me said , 'if they 're going to be so literal in showing them at it , they should at least have edited out the bit of cloth between them ' . This paradox of it being too literal and too fake at once applies not just to the sex scenes , but to the whole film in general . It 's rather insulting really in how fake it is . The film as a whole is just so cheap and lacks the tight and oppressive atmosphere of the score.The CD of the complete opera is available from amazon.com and I can not recommend it highly enough . Vishnevskaya is miraculous , and the conducting by her husband Rostropovich ( both personal friends of the composer ) is inspired . Rostropovich and Shostakovich studied composition together , and although not all of Rostropovich 's recordings of Shostakovich are first rate , this is the definitive ( and most alive ) rendition . It probably always will be . Buy the CD , and pass up on the DVD .	-1
I have to tell I really liked this show , but Neil Geraldo 's guitar sounds like it 's on the Moon ... you cant hear it . Since I am big fan of Neil and a player myself , I found this VERY dissapointing . It really takes away from an otherwise great show . Unfortunatley , this one wont see much playing time . I advise you to steer clear .	-1
the show starts with an incredible performance of war pigs . unbelievable ! everybody - ozzy , geezer , ward and iommi - are in great form ! the next song is nib . just when tony iommi breaks into the immortal solo , that 's the time these freaks to insert an interview ! i was speechless , my heart was in my friggin hand and every known expletive spewing from my mouth - the m* % $ # r f # $ % ^rs ... likewise it is with every song that follows.what must have been a truly great show is ruined in this dvd ! this is one of the moments you wish something like the texas chainsaw massacre happened in these stupid music companies !	-1
They cut songs in half to fit in interviews . How annoying and egotistic of the editors who probably thought it was cool editing technique . Lame	-1
After Clapton Unplugged expectations were high and the recording of the Live at Madison Square show was unable to capture the energy of the artists and the audience , making much of the DVD dull and boring . One of the few highlights for me was the appearance of Bob Dylan toward the end of the show . I am not sure who decided to bring Mary Blige on stage - she has neither class nor talent . Her act does not fit and takes away from an already borderline production . Die hard Clapton fans may want to wait for a big sale on this DVD .	-1
I am sure that all the performances except a few songs were lip-synched . I think she actually sang only `` Wishing you were somehow here again '' , `` Music of the Night '' and `` Time to Say Good-bye '' . You will notice it easily if you compare the difference of the sound between those three and others . Obviously , lip-synched songs sounded very weak lacking `` her spirit '' . `` Deliver Me '' is a clear example . It even made me laugh . ( Look at the choir who do n't seem like as skillful as Ms. Brightman in lip-synching ! ) What a disappoinment ! ! ! I do n't understand why she chose that way . Maybe she is too old to actually sing many songs in a row before audience without technical support . Ms. Brightman , I do n't want to see your appearance , stage manner or dancing . I just want to see you sing with your passion communicating spiritually with the audience . If you ca n't sing , simply quit singing , please ...	-1
Sigh ... About a half of the video clips were too offensive for me to finish watching . I did hate to see the scenes of lesbian and gay things as well as meaningless sex-oriented ones . And another half were too boring to keep watching . Some clips are like watching only one still image from the beginning to the end ( for example , `` One More Try '' and `` A Different Corner '' ) . Can you imagine how boring it would be ? I bought this with some expectation because I was a fan of his , but now I `` declare '' I am no longer his fan . If you do n't want to be like me , I recommend you to stick to only CDs . I think this is for crazy fans only.P.S . Avoid this dvd if you do n't want to store another trash in your house .	-1
Blinding-fast edition , absolutely no concert footage , audio interviews with band member only.. man , this is a mess of a DVD taht will give you no pleasure at all , even being a KISS fanatic.Sad ...	-1
How can a product like this have an average review rating of 4.5 stars is beyond my grasp . I like KISS , but this DVD adds absolutely nothing to their filmography . I wodner who had the `` smart '' idea of making a video withoune one single complete live song here ... . Who had the `` bright '' idea of making such a fast edition , where you can not focus at one point for more than half-a-second ! ! ! ! Oh , Lord , this could have been a great tribute , the definitive tribute to their reunion but , as it is , it seems just another cheap KISS merchandise ...	-1
VH1 Divas Live 99\As I read the reviews from customers , I decided not to buy . I have the oroginal , recorded from the original broadcast . There are amazing performances ! I read in the reviews that many of the performances are edited badly . I want to see and hear Whitney do the songs from the album 'My Love is your Love ' . Also , Bobby Brown comes onstage at the end ( ? ) of Whitneys performance , and they burst into a quick `` Who Dat ' from JT Money ! Fun , and well , hilarious , too . There are real gems..one of a kind perfomace on the origianl broadcast . That is what makes a live DVDworth it . Like any of the Amy Winehouse concert films I own . Raw , live , like beng there . Too bad . Got ta pass on this one . Thank you to those of us who review products .	-1
This is one of the most amazingly disappointing cds I have ever bought.I have been a Dan fan almost since the inception . While the sound of this anemic collection of tunes is Steely Dan , all the wit and brilliance that once gave this band its unique appeal is gone . There are no soaring insturmental solos , no polished satiric lyrics . While the additude of ripe debauchery that this band espoused in ts early work appears rakish on one still in youth , the very over indulgent lifestyle celibrated by this band has dulled the razor sharp neural edge that made them so outstanding . The cd is dull and witless , not quite a stinker but almost .	-1
I hate to trot out the `` what happened ? '' cliche but what happened ? Fagen used to be able to write songs . This is a collection of grooves with indescriminate words tacked on and thus is indistinguishable from his last solo album and will probably be indistinguishable from the next Steely Dan album . Ca n't Buy a Thrill and Katy Lied were collections of superlative songs performed by exciting musicians . Two Against Nature is Donald and Walter cooly jamming for 45 minutes , or an hour . Who knows ; I stopped paying attention after about ten minutes .	-1
Steely Dan 's numerous lineups in the seventies contained some of the finest musicians of the day . This has n't changed . The musicianship on this album is nothing short of perfect ... a little too perfect for my taste . The performances here are so flawless , they completely eclipse the heart and honesty that makes good music what it is . Long gone are the warm analog days of & quot ; The Royal Scam & quot ; and & quot ; Aja & quot ; . Instead , Fagan and Becker supply us with this super-refined , stark white vision of an album.Now , you 're probably saying & quot ; Yeah , but are the songs any good ? & quot ; Not really ... Dan used to be great because they mixed jazz and rock so perfectly . I mean I literally marvel over some of the chord changes on those old albums . They always managed to throw in a hook where you least expected it too . that 's what made them great . Now , the songs are too muddled in brainy insincerity that they just kind of glide past you . I loved Fagan 's & quot ; Nightfly & quot ; and & quot ; Kamakiriad & quot ; . This album just does n't touch me like any of their older stuff . I miss the good old days ...	-1
Steely Dan sounds great on CD but is boring to watch on DVD as there is not much stage presence . I will stick to their CD 's which are great and not any DVD 's . They also omited their best songs like : School , Rikki..This one is not a keeper .	-1
I listened to this album fairly frequently ( and quite liked it ) when I was about 17 , then lost it within a year . I bought it again many years later , listened to it once , and have never played it since . It 's awful.It 's frankly difficult to imagine a worse example of navel-gazing erected into such a pompous , self-impressed musical monument . Nearly every song on this album expresses bland ( and unexplained ) angst as though it were an Apocalypse . One can see how it appeals to either adolescents or not very bright people who are self-persuaded that they have 'problems ' of some profundity . ( There 's even a track entitled 'Goodbye Cruel World ' and a song beginning with the line 'I wan na go home ' . ) Leaving aside the triteness of the concept of an emotional 'wall ' built around the supposedly tortured individual , consider how the idea itself is explored : When we grew up and went to schoolThere were certain teachers who wouldHurt the children in any way they could . [ from 'The Happiest Days of our Lives ' ] Is there anyone who *hasn't* had that experience ? It 's one thing to explore a shallow theme , another entirely to do so in bad lyrics . Then the teenager goes home from school and enters an Oedipal world whereMother 's gon na make all your nightmares come true.Mother 's gon na put all her fears into you.Mother 's gon na keep you right here under her wing.She wont let you fly , but she might let you sing . [ from 'Mother ' ] Lyrics that basically punch you in the face with their ideas are not really intended for thinking people . A self-pitying thirteen-year old asked to write some doggrell about their own feelings of adolescent angst might , for example , have scribbled the following lines on the bus to school : I 've got wild staring eyes.And I 've got a strong urge to fly.But I got nowhere to fly to . [ from 'Nobody home ' ] Feeling sorry for yourself , as George C. Scott once remarked , is the most popular indoor sport : it rarely makes for artistic greatness , however . And here the listener is being asked to choke on two whole jars of it.Some of the songs are of such absurd brevity as to leave the listener with a cheated feeling ; others are inexplicably bookended by random fragments of dialogue or puzzling sound effects . It 's a mess , in short . But so myopic and self-impressed were the Floyds that the album underwent the fate of being reworked into a bloviated motion picture and an even more pompous concert in Berlin . All of this could have been avoided had the artists had any of the introspection that this album so plainly pretends to wear on its sleeve .	-1
In the development of rock , this album reached a new nadir , and believe me , it had lots of competion from Led Zepplin , Yes , Free , and all the other stadium fodder . Where did all the excitement go ? The creation and release of rythmic tension which had been rock 's signature ? Instead we find lyrics with a pretension to depth , and which are in fact staggeringly banal . We find music of leaden obviousness . The antidotes ? Dylan , Neil Young , The Band , The Clash , The Sex Pistols . You know , music with a pulse , instead of musical necrophilia .	-1
i say the inside art to the duble LD and it sc ared me . the music didn ; t help . why do bnands like being so scary ?	-1
This is Patrick O'Hearn 's first solo CD . It comes from 1985 . It is only 32 minutes long . The sound quality is excellent.This is one of those new age albums from the mid-eighties that took advantage of the new digital and CD technologies . It has a great dynamic range and beautiful sonic quatity.Like most of the early new age work , this is all about the sonic qualities and making beautiful sounds . It is not about the compositions . Like many new age albums , this is just repeated sounds ; very beautiful sounds ; but no cohesive composition . I find it to be repetitive and boring.There are some interesting parts to the CD , and track 6 is very good throughout . This whole CD might be OK as background music.Patrick O'Hearn got his start with playing bass for Frank Zappa . He was then in Group 87 with Mark Isham ( who plays trumpet on this CD ) . After that , he struck it big with Missing Persons , featuring 3 other musicians who used to play for Zappa .	-1
I bought & quot ; Lily on the Beach & quot ; when it was first released WAAAAYY back in '89 , and I could feel ( and hear ) old age creeping in . Not on me , but the & quot ; band & quot ; . & quot ; Lily & quot ; sounded like a couple savvy computer geeks slapped together some formulations ( or whatever the hell it 's called when you & quot ; write & quot ; music on computer ) and sneezed out some sounds to sell.I looked at the credits . Only one piece was over five minutes . The cover was some unimaginative scanner imageing . I listened . Only three tracks stood out for me ; the title track , & quot ; Mount Shasta & quot ; and & quot ; Long Island Sunset & quot ; . This cringeing pessimism crept up on me after buying & quot ; Optical Race & quot ; the previous year . However , & quot ; Race & quot ; WALLOWED in depth and vision compared to this . My sadness deepened . I knew there would be no more credits for actual synthesizers and drums . ( Things one must actually touch in unison and have character ) I knew from that moment on I would have to look elsewhere for memerable , visionary music , and I did .	-1
An unlistenable production . Leo 's voice is a limited tool ; used well , as on `` Louise '' , `` Sonora 's Death Row '' , and `` Rings '' , ( among many others ) he delivers world class performances . Used like this , he gives me the willies . Listen to as much of Track 9 as the sample gives you . That is church Christmas pageant quality . Ow.Much of this sounds cribbed from other of his performances . If I had any interest I might find the sources , but really , I suffered through it twice because I only review music after a minimum of two full listens . There will never be a third.And what 's up with that organ ? Whoa , like far out man , that was groovy ! At least it 's short ... ...	-1
First mistake : This is a VOCAL album by one of the world 's greatest instrumentalists.Second error : Leo 's `` singing '' is n't actually all that bad , but he recites on some tracks , tells stories on others , and those are even less interesting than the serious attempts to sing.Third wrong turn : Seven of the ten tracks simply are not compelling . His guitar never goes wrong , but the vocalizing or speaking detracts from that.In his favor : The opening track , `` Running Up the Stairs '' is not bad , and if it were the lone vocal on an otherwise instrumental CD , could have been a wonderful accent piece , in the way that `` Pamela Brown '' was on an early release on Capitol decades ago.Also in his favor : The best minutes on the CD come when he does Johnny Cash 's `` I Still Miss Someone . '' In fact , if he had chosen a dozen Cash songs as a tribute disc , Leo might have had a real winner back in '91 . His limited voice seems to go well with Johnny 's lyric style.My verdict : Even if you love Leo 's playing , as I have since the '70 's , and do n't mind his occasional singing , as I do n't , this item can be skipped . There are so many Kottke recordings that are really worth owning , especially the ones made before this one . Save your funds for those .	-1
`` Famous Blue Raincoat '' instantly became one of my favorite albums of all time ( I bought it at the same time as `` A Capella '' by Rundgren from which `` Pretending to Care '' from `` Hunter '' came ) and have hoped to recapture that magic in another album by Warnes . From reading the reviews here , I thought `` Hunter '' would be that album . Not . I ca n't imagine any album short of Air Supply that sounds more dated . Warnes sounds fine , but the material and production sounds dated even for the 1990s , especially in the first half with sappy keyboard work and drum tracks abounding . Even the fab Rundgren tune , so passionate and pained on `` A Capella '' becomes an empty shell of a tune on this go round.Please someone , save me . Point me to the Warnes album that will catch me up again ...	-1
In high school `` Stroke You Up '' was the jam , so I went downtown and bought the cassette . Let me tell you something : It took me 2 days to listen to it because it was utterly boring . Even `` Stroke You Up '' became unbearable to listen to . No funk , no groove- just lukewarm soul . That was the first *and* the last time I listened to `` Changing Faces . '' The two chicks who made up `` Changing Faces '' had airy , monotonous vocals- no edge to their voices at all . Even the album cover looked boring . These chicks had no style or any type of pizzazz at all . Skip this at all costs and get Zhane .	-1
everything in 94 ' sounded like this , decent bass beats , usual bragging lyrics , yay , hiphop ...	-1
Ever since i first heard of Renaissance I knew i 'd more than likely love the band ; proggy stuff fronted by a female singer with lots of medieval overtones ? Check . And sure enough , when I finally heard Renaissance by way of 'Turn Of The Cards ' I knew I had to buy the album eventually . Just a stellar piece of progressive rock.Where the problem arises is that in my haste to purchase the album , I made the mistake of assuming the logical fallacy of chronological snobbery . Namely , I ignored the previous editions being offered as I assumed that such copies ( made around '94 ) would n't be exactly remastered . So , under this assumption , I bought this edition which was published in 2006 , which I felt would probably be adequate in sound quality ( I avoided the mini-LP version that was also listed because I tend to never touch any of my cds that are housed in those ) . At anyrate when I finally got the cd in from Amazon I was absolutely appalled to see what my $ 12 had gone towards.The front looked fine enough , but the back gave me my first indication that there was something wrong afoot with this edition ; along the bottom was in big red letters : oldies dot com . Annoying I thought , but whatever . However , when I finally opened the cd itself there , ATTACHED to what should have been a cd booklet ( which actually was only 1 double sided page with the artwork on the front & band on the back ) was a mail-in service form for oldies dot com . This might have been fine had it been an advert that you could throw away , but it was melded together with the cd artwork itself and I actually had to cut it out to be rid of it . It was also around this time that I noticed that in the bottom left corner of backside insert ( behind the cd ) was a HOLE in the insert itself.A HOLE.I 've worked in the used cd industry myself as it turns out and cds with a hole-punch in the back insert generally mean a promotional copy/other such thing and that you should n't buy it back for anything close to full value . Now I recognized that same HOLE in my NEWLY PURCHASED CD . Needless to say I am at a total loss and absolutely DO NOT RECOMMEND this edition in any way/shape/form . Had I not already opened the box/cd & had thrown away everything else , I would be shipping this back to Amazon.Coincidentally , the mail-order insert I cut out said towards the top , `` Collectibles Records is the largest and fastest growing independent reissue label in the US '' For the sake of music lovers everywhere I hope not and would encourage any true lover of music to avoid ANYTHING put out by Collectible Records/oldies dot com like the Plague .	-1
An obvious attempt at cashing in on the name of a once proud , creative , interesting classic American psych band . Doug Ingle , always the lead singer/principal songwriter is absent entirely leaving those duties in the incapable hands ( mostly ) of guitarist Erik Braun . What do we get , horrible vocals , occassinal out of tune guitar and the most laughably bad songs ever written ( Check out & quot ; Searchin'Circles & quot ; ) . Sounds nothing like Iron Butterfly ; more like a talentless hippie kid Deadhead wannabee concoction.Possibly one of the worst records ever made .	-1
total waste of money only purchased because a friend said it was a good album but it is crap all their other albums are great and worth purchasing I think there were a couple of songs that were good . OK white room is a great song but the price of this album does n't justify purchasing this and i grew up in this era .	-1
This album is wat too bluesy . I do n't understand Eric Clapton 's diabloical obsession with the blues . The blues is silly and outdated . So is this album . There are a couple of standout tracks , but most of it is just psychedelic blues . GIBBERISH ! That 's what most of this is ! GIBBERISH ! Who cares whether the blues dummy feels free or not ? I for one , do not .	-1
... Look , I grew up in the Midwest in the 1970s and '80s and I heard a lot of this junk growing up , both from musical mentors and on `` classic rock '' radio and I am SO HEARTILY SICK OF JIM MORRISON AND THE DOORS . The guy was such a total weenie . Since when is getting so drunk that you fall of the stage a great moral virtue ? And what a preening , self-centered gasbag ! Of all the great hippie-era 'Sixties bands , the Doors are perhaps the least deserving of their legendary status ... They had a couple of volcanic , primal early hits but the Doors catalog as a whole is so boring and bloated . Skip ahead to 1976 and crank up the Ramones : now *that's* real rock rebellion ! ( Axton )	-1
This is NOT the original recording . It has been remixed . Bad idea . I do n't understand why the Doors albums were remastered in 1999 , but only released in the US in that box set . The '99 remasters sounded great . But now they 're remixed ? ? I think even the average listener would be able to tell that something just does n't sound right here . It is n't the same classic recordings you 're used to hearing.Now , why am I against the remixes ? Well , for one , it opens the door to reinterpretation . I mean , why not get a whole host of remixers for the project ? You could have today 's top DJs remixing classic albums from every era . You could buy the Timbaland version of Light My Fire for when you want that combination of Jim Morrison and super sexy deep club beats . Why not just put the raw tracks on DVD audio and let the listener `` remix '' for themselves ? Maybe you could get some guest musicians to add tracks to the original recordings . I mean , maybe what LA Woman really needs is a Slash guitar solo . Or how about getting Napalm Death to add some crunchy heaviness to Roadhouse Blues ? Do you get the point ? If you start rearranging the past , where do you stop ? And now these remixed CDs are taking the place of the original catalog , so new listeners will be hearing something totally different than what we originally heard and fell in love with . Classics are classics for a reason . Remastering for higher fidelity is one thing , but remixing , rearranging , and reinterpreting are quite another .	-1
How anyone could fail to see how funny this band were beats me . The fact that their funniness was unintentional , and that they took themselves seriously makes it so much more relishable . Truly moronic lyrics and highly erratic muscianship , and on top of that Morrisons wobbly tenor . The highlight is the howlingly funny The End , it needs a Mike Myers to really do it justice . One of the most hilariously overblown , psuedo , pieces of nonsense to come out of a 60 's recording studio , and oh boy did it have some competition . A collectors item for those who have a taste for kitsch .	-1
... this album demonstrates what happens when a public school education meets hallicinogens . `` The End '' is a mindless rant that would n't make the cut on `` The Wiggles '' , and `` The Crystal Ship '' is Cha-chi on pot ! ! ! The 60 's were a whacked-out era , and this piece of solid gold crap is a time-machine to the scene of the crime . If I really wanted a good laugh , I would have bought `` Minnie Pearl does Devo '' , but at least then I would have known what I was getting . This album offers no such luxury ! ! !	-1
One of the common credentials the Doors often have heaped upon them is that they were the serious , dark , poetic version of their light , fluffy fellow 60 's Californian hippie pop acts like the Mamas and the Papas . This is to their credit , but it is an endorsement that still fails to account for , much less exonerate the boys for the fact that they were just another sad facet of the hippie fad.If we examine some of the Doors most prominent and unfortunately least appealing features , we will find a very bland , monotonous , predictable , and last but not least , pretentious band . The excessive feature of the organ often sounds like an underpaid Church accompanist finally reaching breakdown and leading a mutiny of one against the house of God . Krieger 's penchant for small , twangy lead guitar riffs in virtually every Door 's song is perhaps a little less annoying but still makes a mockery out of hyperbolic claims Doors enthusiasts often make about their place in history . But all of this pales in comparision to the pseudo-intellectual bleatings of a rock and roll idol whose rocky road to success ended in a French bathtub . `` Light My Fire '' could have potentially been a classic of the 60 's era , of which there are many . In spite of its daft lyrics , the really baffoonish way of rhyming things like `` liar '' and `` higher '' , it had the makings of a decent little ditty . The emphasis there is on `` little '' . Instead , it was expanded , bloated beyond all proportion to its actual merit with Ray Manzarek 's obnoxious , sedating organ . This is an excellent example of the quality of the recalcitrant Church accompanist quality I mentioned earlier that Manzarek 's playing exhibits . After what feels like at least a couple of days , but in reality is more like 2 minutes of this tired self indulgence , one gets the feeling that there 's only one other organ Manzarek abuses this gratuitously . Unfortunately , the boys are n't finished . They have more excess , more indulgent trash to heap upon this rapidly gathering pile of refuse in the form of Krieger 's customary and by now obligatory tiny twangs . God , this guy is awful . Like Manazerk 's mischievous meddling of the organ keys , Krieger 's turn in the spotlight is all too long and very , very unwelcomed . Finally after approximately 5 minutes of musical noodling , Morrison returns to recite lines that were poor the first time around , again.Jim and the boys continue to drag their collective knuckles in the mire on the wimpy , moronic `` Crystal Ship '' . With lyrics that appear to have been scrawled by an acne riddled junior high school student in haste to complete a poetry assignment and music that would not sound out of place on an elevator , this is the kind of song that most people would be personally embarrassed to have written , much less record and release . `` Break On Through '' has familiar organ tinkering from Manzarek . Not just familiar in the sense that it 's the kind of rubbish his grubby fingers are always immersed in , but also due to the nagging suspicion one has that this has been done somewhere before in the 1950 's and immortalized in a 1980 's Pee Wee Herman movie of all places . `` Tequila ! `` , if that helps . Aside from its sad derivative sound , it contains some characteristically pretentious attempts at `` poetry '' by Jimbo before he himself proceeds to inflict the most damage on his credibility by shrieking the idiotic line `` everybody loves my baby ! '' over and over , seemingly ad infinitum.Perhaps the real tip of the hat should go to `` The End '' . More pseudo poetry from Morrison . It 's clearly an effort to shock and unsettle listeners . It 's not only embarrassing drivel masquerading as poetry , but it 's not even original in the aspects that are supposed to be the most shocking . The killer , awaking before dawn proceeds to kill his father and make love to his mother . Although maybe the average Doors fan is unaware of this ( can they even read ? ) but this is a concept that is of course directly lifted from Sophocles . It should be noted that Morrison 's ambition was to be taken seriously as a poet and not just a rock and roll star , but his `` poetry '' was routinely derided and dismissed by critics . Anyone asking why need only listen to the 11 plus minutes of the tedious , pseudo-shockfest of `` The End '' .The only good thing about the above track is that it does mark the end of a very pitiful listening experience . Jim Morrison to his credit , went through all of the rapid stages that accompany many of the most exaggerated rock stars in the space of just a few years . He hit his commercial and `` artistic '' ( sic ) peak and was regarded as a sex symbol . Within a few years however , he had become dumpy , bedraggled , and clearly out of ideas . He then died embarrassingly , a sad drug related death of a burned out case . It took Elvis two decades , Morrison did it in about four years . Live fast indeed.On a footnote , I visited Paris recently and had the chance to see the cemetery in Montmartre where Sartre and Beckett are buried . I did wonder about the whereabouts of Morrison , but he is buried in the Eastern part of the city and we were staying in the North . Suffice to say , neither of us could be bothered to make the trek .	-1
cOMEON- AN ALBUMthis GREAT-no one is going to read all the accurate 5 star reviews- would you ? me either . list the 8 great Debute albums and this will be listed on most . I wonder what universe this would not be considered great- not a universe I would want to be in . If you REALLY need to be convinced read all the 5 star reviews .	-1
Masterpiece ? How ? Ok , ok ... .They did save the best for last , `` Riders on the Storm '' - without a doubt , a time-capsule classic , thru and thru , with a relevatory electric piano keeping it a-flow . Even the embarrassingly peurile phrase `` dog with a bone '' works in the arrangement . Listening at home in 1972 , over the intercome system me and my Dad installed in our Weehawken , N.J. , home , I was floored . Do n't know why I did not buy the single . Maybe being broke as a cinderblock is a clue ... .. My Mom brought me a vanilla cupcake and a cup of coffee and my 21 year old psyche explored the local solar system , tour guide , old , drunk Jim.Unfortunately , with the exception of the hot cover of John Lee Hooker `` Crawling King Snake '' , most of `` Hyacinth House '' , and tentative tributes to Jimmy Reed and Bo Diddley and Tony Joe White , we were presented with a real dud , lyrically ridiculous and musically monotonous.I have been taking singing lessons ( not that anyone asked ) and was surprised to discover that Jim Morrison sings `` correctly '' . Whatever went wrong , on L.A. WOMAN his *expression* remains the same throughout.Excuse me ... on the finale track , he reaches out and grabs the torch just before it hits the ground and is extinquished . [ review based upon early reissue on CD ] .	-1
I was disapointed in the mix of the entire DVD Audio disk . Who ever did it should of call the engineers who worked on ELP 'S Brain Sallad Surgery . The mix is flat and Jims vocals need more than just the center channel speaker . I also feel the sub channel was left out in the remix of this great recording . If you want to hear great L.A. Woman recording BUY A TURN TABLE AND THE LP VERSION OF L.A. WOMAN .	-1
It 's now very well known that the labelling on this disc is deceptive - it was NOT taken from the original analog master tape , but from a second generation copy and DAT . Sonically , it is not bad , but not anywhere close to the earlier gold CD from the now defunct DCC . Not enough of an upgrade over the last Capitol remaster to be worthwhile .	-1
Or did the 60s generation suffer from horrible taste in music ? I do n't know . All I know is that I 've had this album since the 3rd grade when I was into fairly simple music like the Beatles , and even then I found Pet Sounds unappealing . It simply has nothing to it.Every time I hear someone praise this album , it seems as if they focus on its & quot ; great production. & quot ; This is something that I 've never understood . Great production ? Britney Spears albums have great production . The Backstreet Boys have great production . Does that make their work any more bearable ? I do n't think so.When I look for music I want it to have at least one of two things:1 ) Soul ... I want the musicians to put true emotion into their work . Jazz for example.2 ) Smarts ... I want to hear songs/albums made by thoughtful and talented people who do something musically/lyrically that just blows me away . Pink Floyd/Radiohead/Autechre for example.Pet Sounds has neither . It 's full of bland harmonizing by guys that could barely swim . The tracks do nothing daring and most of the songs were written with outside help . That 's never a good sign . Another bad sign is the army of session musicians that the group hired . I 've yet to see a quality album put out by musical mercenaries.If you 're going to waste your money , at least waste it on real music . And if your set on buying Pet Sounds , I 'll dig out my old copy and give you a bargain . It 's one of my oldest CDs , but it looks like it 's brand new . I doubt that you 'll play it any more than I did . At least I hope you do n't .	-1
It is mind boggling all the hype surrounding this badly overrated CD . I like many of the Beach Boys big hits but this CD just does n't cut it . On the version I borrowed , out of sixteen songs only the four lead tracks-Would n't It Be Nice , Caroline No , God Only Knows , and Sloop John B are of high quality . I Know There 's An Answer , Here Today , and You Still Believe In Me are slightly captivating among the remaining songs . The problem here at least to my ears is that the songs all have a similar arrangement . Not slow and romantic like Surfer Girl or Warmth of The Sun or fast and jumpy like Fun Fun Fun and Surfin ' USA . Its all mid-paced and kind of spacey with a strong lack of ooomph and too many special effects.It boggles the mind how one television broadcast ranked this CD as the third greatest rock n roll album of all time . Geeze Louise , this album barely even rocks ! There is a strong lack of guitar presence throughout this collection and way too many special ef ! fects . It trudges along like a sluggish snail and you can hardly wait for it to end . The harmonies all sound the same after a while and Brian hogs most of the lead vocals . The lyrics may have some special meanings but that 's based on the fact that you have not fallen asleep listening to the music . How anyone can compare this to even the weakest of Beatles records is ludicrous.In my opinion , stick with a good compilation of the Beach Boys . California Girls , Help Me Rhonda , I Get Around , and other early hits will always remain classics and keep any party hopping . I have three of them and they all work fine . However , when Brian Wilson attempted to get too deep and stray away from grooving surfer rhythms , the result is a stony bore . Borrow it from a friend but save your money as this music just does not cut the mustard .	-1
Never heard of emSomeone said they were good so I brought this.Thought ok but , where are the tunes.U2 's latest album is better and more inspirational.It should be listened to by millions , this is n't music just noise.I ca n't understand why it 's rated ? All the songs sound the sameThe singer , forgot his name , got no emotion , I think that guy from Good Charlotte is good , and is one of the all time greats.Also Celine Dion , is the mistress of love songs , buy her greatest hits for true greatness.U2 How to Dismantle an Atom Bomb a must buy album.So is Rumours by Fleetwood Mac.I think this is only for the mentally ill , or sort of things to play to interrigate people.I think the Spice Girls are inspriational truely the greatest pop group ever `` Zig-A-Zig-A '' what genius.Also what about Steps and S Club 7 , genius's.Also bananarama , brilliant ! ! ! ! This is popREAL POPThis album is noiseGive me Celine Dion any day ! ! ! P.S.The E stands for Expert ! ! !	-1
It 's a crying shame when one of the great classics of 70 's rock is treated so shabbily like this . This mlps version should really have been an improvement over the previous releases ; instead , we get poor quality cardboard shoddily put together albeit with an insert containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese . There are 6 bonus tracks of alternative versions of the main tracks but what 's the point when the sound quality is so very desperately poor ? If you are going to pay so much more for an album to get you to `` upgrade '' from your present copy , I 'd demand a much better product that what we have here . I guess I could forgive the sub-standand mini-lp replica sleeve design but I definitely can not forgive the very poor sound quality for the kind of price these guys are asking for . My advice is to wait for a much better remastered version to come out and to give this one a wide berth.Content-wise , these tracks represent some of the best work ever done from the early 70s . When you have both Paul McCartney and George Harrison taking an interest in your work let alone Todd Rundgren producing as well , it 's safe to say that you 're on to something big and that 's exactly what this album represents . From the brilliant slide guitar work of Harrison on my favourite album track `` Day After Day '' to the soulful and beautiful opening track `` Take It All '' you get track after track of simply good songwriting . No fillers on this baby at all and it still sounds as enjoyable today as it did all those years ago.Let 's hope the powers that be get their act together and head back to the drawing board to bring us an mlps version that is worthy of the album . I wait with bated breath ... .	-1
did they have to mess up a great thing . As the previous reviewers stated , this is NOT a CD version of the original . It 's getting nearly impossible to find `` original '' vinyl recordings on CD anymore . `` They '' have to add bonus tracks , re-mix , etc , etc . Too bad that those that never had the opportunity to hear the originals will never experience how great they were ( unless they can find a copy on vinyl ) .	-1
This is the WORST sounding CD i have ever heard , HANDS DOWN ! ! What 's with these other reviews that the audiophile freaks say is sounding good on this cd ? Even Ian himself has admitted there is no good master of Aqualung available anywhere . The original master was destroyed and an inferior master was used . This album was recorded in an old church turned into a studio where the sound and acoustics were terrible . Led Zeppelin had the same studio except a smaller room which made the sound better and more intimate . I have to turn my cd player up all the way on volume just to hear it . Ian himself says this is not one of their better releases in their day . Stand Up and Benefit blow this away . Not to say there is n't great songs on this release if only you could hear them . What a shame NONE of the Jethro Tull catalog has been remastered properly . I guess i 'll try the Tull blu-spec cd and see how that sounds .	-1
Aqualung is a true classic album . I disappointed The sound quality , is the same of 1997 version , say print on CD : `` Digital Remasters 1997 Toshiba-EMI Japan . The CD was released in 2003 with the same sound of 1997 version . The package is beautiful , in gatefold mini Lp , with lyrics and a Aqualung cart . Maybe in future , the Remasters quality for this album be better than this , a classic album can may a better treatment.Unless you want a collectors item ... .do n't waste your time if your looking for a better sounding cd .	-1
Oh lookie ! ! ! ! It 's yet another release from marketing genius Ian Anderson ! MY GOD . How many different versions of your albums do we need sir ? Jethro Tull used to be my favorite band , but after surviving the past decade with no new music from the band , and an ever increasing array of remixed , remastered , redone versions of the same old crap , I 've had enough.What 's next ? The Norwegian version of `` Passion Play '' ? I can hardly wait !	-1
Compared to the other Ultra Lounge CDs in the series , `` Music for a Bachelor 's Den '' is likely more what people were listening to @ the time , rather than the uniquely unusual pieces found on the other ones . The album starts , though , with a few `` cool '' versions of `` Once In a While '' ( a bongo variation by Terry Snyder ) & Arthur Lyman 's take on `` Love for Sale '' ( xylophone-lounge ) . One mistake here , though , is Jackie Gleason 's `` Melancholy Serenade '' mistakenly titled 'Theme from the Honeymooners ' . As another reviewer pointed out , this may be possibly more melodic but is no 'Honeymooners ' . It is actually Gleason 's theme for his live self-titled variety show of the early 50s , where the 'The Honeymooners ' was popularized . But it 's David Rose 's `` Sunset Strip '' and Jimmy Dorsey 's `` So Rare '' that really tear it up on this album , both very hot , hot , hot ! The 50s standards adapted from film and TV , `` Moonglow and Love Theme from 'Picnic ' '' , `` Around the World in 80 Days '' , & `` Theme from 'Route 66 ' '' not only push you right into that period , giving one a taste of what was actually popular at the time , but are probably some of the most entertaining and listenable pieces from these mediums . I , myself , have always had a big thing for all three . `` Like Young '' , a bit of a `` beat '' tune , is possibly best sung , as it is here by Linda Lawson . `` Moritat ( A Theme from The Threepenny Opera ) '' is one of my favorites , though ( popularly known as `` Mack the Knife '' ) , here an instrumental piece . This really illustrates the resurgence of the old music hall rag-piano sound of the late 50s-60s , perfectly complimenting this version .	-1
The best Sammy CD ? Are you kidding ? I just spent $ 30 to hear a truncated ( albeit totally swinging ) & quot ; Come back to me & quot ; . And & quot ; The Witch is dead ? & quot ; You 'd need to be a complete ding-dong if you ca n't find a better way to honour this man 's legend . A waste o ' time and money.Invest , instead , in & quot ; Live at the Cocoanut Grove & quot ; and truly experience just what Sam is all about . This cat swings with the best of them and , when he 's loose , he 's better than you can possibly imagine .	-1
It 's been a long time since I purchased this Soundtrack ( ? ) Album and since then I 've p # # sed-off about the lack of what 's so good about the movie not being on this album . Where 's all the tricky piano interludes including the jazz club gigs and Jeff 's ( of course it 's not really his ) solo stuff and the brothers singing Sweet Sixteen . But the worst of all is the total lack of Michelle 's singing . From her audition and that incredible More Than You Know to her debut and Ten Cents a Dance to the montage of Ca n't Take My Eyes Off of You to the big time and The Look of Love . Where are they ? For that matter where 's Michelle 's album . Singers always want to be actors and actors be singers . This has got to be the first case of an actor who did n't want to be a singer and the real irony is this one 's got a voice , one of soul and character.So anyway , soundtrack albums usually are from the movie and rather than shorten the numbers they extended full versions and seldom leave you longing for what 's not there . This is a very big exception . There appears to be material that 's not from the original soundtrack . If I 'm mistaken , shoot me , but I do n't remember some of this stuff and it certainly was n't what I was buying this CD to hear . It 's sorta like the photo on the album , nice picture but it 's not in the movie.The two star rating is n't for the quality of the material on the album , it 's for not filling the standard requirements of a soundtrack album . It leaves much to be desired .	-1
There are only two vocals by michelle pfeiffer ! Where are the others ? If it is advertised as the original motion picture sound track , then include the complete recording.Otherwise state that it is not complete . I found that out after receiving the CD and reading the inside cover.Of course , the music on it is great , but had i known about this , i would , definitely , not have ordered it .	-1
When this came out , it was a revelation to me . Listening to it now , after several years , well -- -it makes me feel ill . It 's almost the same effect as ingesting way too much saccarine . Pass .	-1
After the fiery and complex `` Inside Out '' , this was a huge disappointment . This band was NOT Lacking for musicianship but it left something to be desired as far as consistency sometimes . After 2 high quality releases like `` Eye of The Beholder '' and `` Inside Out '' , Chick again went the commercial borderline smooth-jazz route ( a lot like `` Light Years '' ) , allowing some bits of teeth to show but not much . The songs are rather forgettable , cookie-cutter fuzak , and `` 99 Flavors '' gets downright cheesy ( after all , it was originally a demo for a then new Yamaha keyboard that Chick wrote ) . The last cut shows bits of the fiery EB but that 's it , just bits over a rather formulaic composition.Skip this one , too much technology and calculation , not enough soul .	-1
You know how most people will say either they do n't dream ( which , by the way , is NOT true ) or else they ca n't remember them ; well , this album is one dream you DO N'T want to remember ! I totally discount ALL reviewers that have not intensely listened to the entire catolouge of the group they 're reviewing ( but , of course , there are exceptions ) . I own the entire Spyro Gyra ( SG ) catolouge ; accordingly , my individual ratings are based on the recording at hand , considering the group 's entire catologue , not just one or two other albums . How on earth can anyone say something is `` the greatest '' when they have an incomplete basis for making such a ridiculous claim ! Music is subjective . All opinions I assert are my honest evaluations based on my likes and dislikes , as well as the group 's total output.This being the case , this is not a very good album.First : if you 'd told me the group was gathering people like the Tower Of Power Horns , Will Lee , and Lani Groves -- I 'd have thought we 'd be in for one terrific recording . Well , these folks are on this cd , and , to say the least , the way they are used here is TOTALLY disappointing ! And while I generally love Alex Ligertwood 's vocals ( especially his work with Santana ! ) , they just do n't work here . In fact , both vocal inclusions seem silly and totally out of place.Second : the recording seems to have no idea of what it wants to say or where it wants to go . Most songs are not written by Jay , and perhaps this has something to do with it.Third : aimless , general tunes , out of place vocals , lame and silly Jamaican/Caribbean/Reggae-like numbers are completely out of charcater for SG , and they are a rather embarrassing inclusion here , IMHO.On the brighter side -- Birks Law ( written by Jay ) is a decent tune.In conclusion , this is one of the weaker efforts by what I consider a great group . I have been an ardent fan and follower of the group since their inception . I have seen them live many times . I admire Jay and his work . I generally like most SG songs . But ( and it hurts me to say this ) this is just not a very good album . There are much better SG albums available , and I would advise staying away from this recording until , at least , you 've sampled many other SG albums.Thanks for reading my reivew ! Rock on !	-1
By the time this CD came out I had already been a fan of the Rippingtons for eight years . Obviously , those who reviewed this before me were n't very familiar with their earlier works . I was terribly disappointed with most of this ! ! ! This CD does have it 's moments ... .Girl With The Indigo Eyes , Native Sons Of A Distant Land , and True Companion . Overall , I felt that it was their first flop ! ! ! I just know that they can do better than this because all of their previous disks were better .	-1
I bought this compact disc for the David Buskin song it is not the original at all . The only way to get the original is vinyl only . I wish they would release it on compact disc .	-1
Michael W. Smith is , undeniably , the most successful Christian musician ever . But his third album unfortunately lacked the timeless elements of his first two ( and fourth ) albums . At the time of its release , THE BIG PICTURE was very big . We loved it and could n't get enough of it ( that is , until we finally had enough ) . It was one of those contemporary Christian albums that had a lot of hype and had not trouble living up to the hype . But it lacked the potential to maintain the audience 's interest as the artist matured and especially as the audience matured ( the target audience was clearly young teenagers -- more on this later ) .The majority of these songs though quite good in their own way were mostly what one may call fad songs . There 's nothing here that is similar to the musical style in PROJECT , 2 , or even I2 ( EYE ) . This was clearly Michael W. Smith 's attempt had a little bit of edgey , fast-paced rock 'n ' roll . And it worked at the time . ( David Meece did something very similar with his album 7 . ) THE BIG PICTURE boasted a more daring Smitty as well : one who was not afraid to tackle the what , at the time , were pretty tough and taboo issues . `` Old Enough to Know '' dealt with a young lady 's struggle in the areas of peer pressure regarding sexuality ; `` The Last Letter '' addressed the theme of suicide , which became quite an ordeal among teens in the 80s ; and `` Goin ' Through the Motions '' addressed general peer pressure among young people in general . The messages contained in these songs were positive , uplifting , and fortunately , very effective . But as this music was written for me and my generation when we were around the ages of 12-17 years old , we have now outgrown it . We may , to a much lesser extent , deal with some of these issues ; but as we are now in our late 20s and 30s , we deal with altogether different issues . And though there 's now a new generation of 12-17-year-olds dealing with the aforementioned problems , they 're going to seek out help in more contemporary music . ( I hope the music will have the same good advice as this one had . ) But very few , if any , will look for that kind of guidance from a 20 year old Christian rock album.The first four songs on here are memorable , nostalgic , and overall enjoyable . `` Rocketown '' is the only one which I would say has `` timeless '' appeal . The `` Bonus Track 1 '' is a very short piano-only piece which is somewhat reminiscent of one of Elton John 's more classic melodies . I wish that piece had been longer like the two instrumental pieces on his album , 2.Both Michael W. Smith 's previous album as well as his next album were far superiour to this one .	-1
The only song I like on this album is Secret Ambition . The other songs are very slow . For sure his worst album yet .	-1
Is not as I expected not anointed one from The Lord Jesus Christ.But in my point of view he need to do more to put his music on high level .	-1
Tear Down These Walls was Billy Ocean 's final run at chart success . The album features one of the most reviled songs from the 80 's , `` Get Outta My Dreams , Get Into My Car '' . It generally makes the list for worst songs from the 80 's , but it is a little harsh as the song has a fun , innocent charm that seems to be missing from most songs these days . It made its way to number one and it was the last time Mr . Ocean had a top ten single . He became a casualty of the grunge movement in the early 90 's as most 80 's stars who were perceived to be soft met up with a similar chart demise .	-1
this disc is okay but it does n't show the talent & amp ; depth of this man.from 76-82 he was grooving.then he came stateside and was watered down.this set hardly does the man justice.he is a very talented artist who deserves better .	-1
With this album Sam 's career tumbled , which is understandable , because basically all songs are weak . You can get into the Full Force song `` Hurt me '' , but already the lyrics are n't convincing . `` Another night '' or `` Spirit of America '' are rather boring songs stressing on hits like Madonna 's `` Justify my love '' and American enthusiasm . Not convincing	-1
Should have been called disappointment , BDP is no PE . KRS1 's ` knowledge ' is really no more than Nation Of Islam rhetoric , not so cleverly put to music . KRS1 was always more ` preacher ' than ` teacher ' , inviting obedience rather than introspection . Here , in ` Ya Strugglin ' he adds homophobia to his cannon of hates .	-1
I got nothin but love for kid rock ( as a matter of fact , i think he 's so fine ! ) and so much respect for his music , i think all his CDs rock ... except this one . There 's just way too much rap and barely any southern rock , rock and all of his other genres he mixes in his CDs . Im not a big fan of white rap b/c the white rock and the black rap but i do like his rap in all his other CDs . If you 're thinking about buying this album- I HIGHLY recommend you buy `` DEVIL WITHOUT A CAUSE '' , `` KID ROCK '' , or `` COCKY '' . Those are my favorite Kid Rock albums .	-1
This CD was in poor shape alot of skipping alot of scratches on it . I know the music is good on this cd i have it on cassette tape .	-1
He ca n't sing or act . I do n't have time to go into depth on this one ; just skip it .	-1
Please understand that the meagerly two stars does not reflect the quality of the music itself . The songs are good -- the material on this album ranks among Trout 's finest , I think -- but the sound quality is TERRIBLE ! ! ! I was in disbelief when I looked on the credits and saw that three or four people were actually involved in the production and engineering of this album . I literally thought at first that Trout and his band had recorded this themselves home-made . It makes my stereo sound like a transistor radio -- some songs do n't even sound like they were recorded in stereo ! No bass -- and too much blasted high end ! ( his guitar tone has too much of that tinny high end on some of his other albums , too . ) Given that this album was recorded only about ten years ago , it 's inexcusable to release a CD of this quality , sound-wise.I 'm glad Walter came back with more releases later that apparently utilized technology invented in the last forty years !	-1
Shaquille O'Neal raps about as well as he shoots free throws . Most of the songs here are pretty boring . A lot of guest rappers were brought in , but they do n't help much . The only song that is above average is & quot ; Biological Did n't Bother & quot ; , which is a love song to Shaq 's stepfather . It 's actually pretty touching , believe it or not . I did n't like this CD that much , but Shaq 's fans are free to disagree with me .	-1
When I heard the song & quot ; Flood & quot ; on Christian radio , I instantly fell in love with it . A year later when I heard it on mainstream radio , I knew I had to buy this album . Ugh..I 'm sorry I did . & quot ; Flood & quot ; is the *only* reason to buy this album ; the rest of the songs do n't even measure up to it 's greatness ( in fact , they are quite boring . ) So , if you really love the song & quot ; Flood & quot ; , get this CD . Otherwise , skip it .	-1
An extremely unremarkalbe album with literally NO memorable or catchy songs - which is quite rare for Too Short . Simply put , do not buy this , even for the Too Short lover . Not horrible , just BORING and nothing like his previous efforts .	-1
Im sorry but a tribe called quest 's `` beats rhymes & life '' is wack and so is atcq coz dey are boring and their beats ai n't good at all . Their single dey had `` stressed out '' is lame as hell . Dont support dese lamez .	-1
When this album came out I ran and bought it because it 's Tribe . When I listened to the album I was dissapointed . The beats were corny and the lyrics were wack . The album sounds like it was rushed . There is only 1 good track on the entire album and that 's it .	-1
I ca n't believe I actually liked these guys when they first came out . This CD is full of really bad pop songs , most of which have boring lyrics , bad programming and annoying vocals . I have given this album a chance , and they failed . Nothing like some other GOOD pop albums I own.PS : Sorry guys . At least I did n't give it one star !	-1
Klick on buy used if you want this cd , i personaly em not a Backstreet Boys fan , my cousin gave me this cd , she sayd i cann sell it so i em .This cd was bought in Germany .I also em selling their cd single from germany Quite playing games with my heart .	-1
The Only Reason I gave this C.D a chance was because my Girlfriend Happens to love these Moronic disgraces of Music . 4 songs on this 12 song album were Decent ! the rest Were shoddy Production and too Poppy . & quot ; quit Playing Games with my heart & quot ; a great song has an rnB feel to it . & quot ; As long as you love me & quot ; Great Lyrics and the groove is catchy ! . & quot ; all i have to give & quot ; fairly decent i have to be in the mood to listen to it . & quot ; everybody & quot ; the only reason i like this damn song is because i saw the video so many times i have the lyrics imbedded in my brain . The rest suck . Im sorry But after Artist like & quot ; Prince & quot ; , & quot ; Stevie Wonder & quot ; , & quot ; Michael Jackson & quot ; Paved the way for these young swill Merchants . You think Anyone Would make good music . Well These Puppets for the record companies Suck no Punn intended . if you like this kind of music go listen to Savage Garden at least they have Talent . these morons do n't and Im out !	-1
Talent-Less in every sense of the word.The music is Dated New Jack & amp ; The vocals are plain boring.all of their music is Formula.Avoid at all costs.just like all the other boy bands .	-1
I did n't like this album that much . Only songs i liked are The MC , Step Into A World , A Friend , Ca n't Stop Wo n't Stop . Just To Prove A Point song was horrible and i do n't know why he tried to do a rock song . Putting Puff Daddy on the Step Into A World remix was a terrible decision by KRS . The songs were too short on this album also .	-1
Joe has a good voice but overall the material comes across as Low-Budget R.Kelly .	-1
Oh man is this bad . What else can I say .	-1
now , i now that i am going to tick off more than a few people with his one , but , oh well ... after the first jars album , i was really looking forward to this after hearing the ep . i got it and i was truly dissapointed . it reminds me of dire straits or duran duran ( something of that nature -- the whole 80 's rock vibe ) . anyway , the songs & quot ; crazy times & quot ; and & quot ; frail & quot ; stand out . the rest of the tracks are just crap . whatever happened to the band that wrote achingly beautiful acoustic ballads ? sure , they changed , but was it for the better ? my bet is that it was n't . get the first cd . it is much better .	-1
This is not upbeat stuff . Amidst the depressing and self pitying lyrics is some interesting music . In an era when you are lucky to have 3 worthy songs on an album , Plumbs self titled album has 5 that are worth a listen musically . Keep the razor blades away from teenage girls in your home if your going to buy this one.I am not a teenage girl , so I ca n't tell if these lyrics will send girls into the abyss or pull them away from the edge of it . As I said , musically there are 5 interesting songs , but I do n't see anyone getting lifted up with any of this music.As a parent , I would say check out the lyrics at your favorite lyric website before buying . Make sure they are OK . I bought this based on a recommendation for my 11 year old daughter , but did not give it to her .	-1
Finally Tupac Shakur has came down from cloud 9 , only this has happened after Tupac Shakur has actually visited cloud 9 ( Heaven ) . This double LP sounds more like a compilation of 2Pac 's early work , most tracks were made around the times of `` 2Pacalypse Now '' and `` Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z ... '' , and it shows . Although Tupac ( as always ) comes with it lyrically ( for the most part ) , this album - like his old albums , suffers from poor production . But this LP is still a solid buy , it is just below average overall as an LP . Records like `` Do 4 Me '' and `` I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto ( remix ) '' , alone are an overwhleming excuse to buy this album .	-1

Seems like every one I know who enjoys Punk rock absolutely loves this band . Well I dont . I downloaded a few of there songs and they sounded like bubble gum Punk with emoy vocals . This was a few years ago . Just a little while ago a bought a great peace punk comp that included the above band . In fact it had the aboves title track Die for the government which I hear is there best song on the album . I being the opened minded Indivudual I am listened to this track several times . After the several listenings I concluded that anti-flag were a bunch of fashion punks who read some chomsky and decided to make a album . The song is terrible and insults my intelligence and my belief as a socialist . I can see it now Republicans are going to point there crooked fingers at this albums lyric sheet and laugh at the modern liberal youth.In final words . Punk is dead and Antiflag dances on its graveIf you want real punk please look up Crass , Dead kennedys , Black Flag , Doa , etcPeace	-1
I 've been a huge fan of the McGarrigles since the 1980s , and if CDs could wear out , my copies of their debut album and Love Over and Over would have worn out long ago . Alas , their last album before Kate 's death was disappointing - as in , I copied 3 songs from it and resold the CD within a few weeks . Purely in terms of sound quality , Matapedia is great , but the inspired , witty , sometimes poignant lyrics of their earlier albums are missing , so these supremely gifted songwriters were obviously past their peak . For the record , the 3 songs that were & # 34 ; keepers & # 34 ; are The Biker Song , Talk About It , and Jacques et Gilles . The use of a celesta on The Biker Song made me wonder : Why does n't this amazing little instrument get used more often in pop music ? Jacques et Gilles is a bit on the PC/preachy side , but the melody is fine . Talk About it has some of the delightful & # 34 ; bounce & # 34 ; from some of their earlier albums , as in the songs Love Over and over and Kiss and Say Goodbye.Not bad , but disappointing - a sort of generic pop/folkie album that is not in the same class as the sisters ' earlier albums .	-1
I personally think there is no real defending this album . Rt is right that this is a flat out bad album . Restless Highway sounds good at first but it really is a poorly constructed song . Do n't Let a Thief Steal Into Your Heart is a good song but not on this release . The band that backs Thompson up here is more of a country-rock band which does not fit at all . Plus , there is a lot of filler . Sweet Surrender , Layla and Pavanne are all throwaways . The only song of any significance is House of Cards and by the time it arrives , one has given up on the album entirely.Overall , this felt like a quickly rushed album that really does n't need to be heard except for die-hard Thompson fans ( like the ones reading this review ) . This release can be found on cassette but do n't expect much . I guess no artist can be perfect as , in my opinion , this is the only flat out bad album he ever released .	-1
I heard all these bad reviews from the other reviewers and I was n't sure I should buy this , but my friend convinced me I should . I 'm not sure why everyone hates this book . I mean , it is kind of dumb , but it 's OK .	-1
I know this guy is supposed to be some kind of saint , but this CD left me cold . If Drake ca n't be bothered to show a little emotion on this , he should n't have bothered to record it .	-1
What a pleasant surpise we have here . Susannah has a great voice ! Susannah sure does sing beautifully on this cd.The real problem I have with this cd is in the instrumentation . Whoever the musical director was for this project should be fired . This is a jazz cd , but that does n't mean that the music on this cd should n't have some melody to it . On most the songs there was no true melody . Susannah needs a new band . Susannah has too much talent to waste on projects like this.I currently own all of the S.M . catalog and would like to say that there are other cds by Susannah that are much better than this cd.Recommendation : I can not recommend this cd .	-1
I make no bones about it , I 'm not on the band wagon of the `` Manze Craze '' going around the past few years . These Bach Violin Concertos ( and previous recordings ) show Andrew Manze to obviously be a violinist of extreme technical ability as far as negotiating complex passages , however what he has in complex passages work he is lacking in flowing melodic line , solid intonation , smooth articulation and beauty of sound . His playing often sounds scratchy , awkward and uneven . The tone he emits from his instrument is not attractive and his phrasing sounds unnatural.Let 's look at the A minor concerto in detail and compare it to Jaap Schroder/Academy of Ancient Music/Christopher Hogwood 's recording on Decca 400 080 ( IDN 3259140008026 Out-of-print ) or ( A Minor Concerto on Uni/L'Oiseau-Lyre - # 43326 ASIN : B000004CYD and E Major Concerto on Pgd/L'Oiseau-Lyre - # 448178 ASIN : B000004CYP ) .Let 's talk about the engineering of the recording , first . When the A minor recording first started I was struck by the boxy closed-in sound of the Manze recording and it 's lack of high overtones from the baroque violins . The prominence of the Manze 's violin overpowers the orchestra . On the other hand , Schroder 's recording is much better balanced with a really nice ambiance to the recording with a decay time of about 2 seconds , perfect . Schroder 's recording has the nice high bright silky overtones which the original instruments should have.For the performance , Manze shows uneven articulation and wavering intonation that is not enjoyable to listen to . Also , there is a lack of what I would call buoyancy to the Manze recording . Schroder has a command of the music with solid intonation combined with smooth articulation . Schroder 's fast movements are buoyant and soaring when needed . While listening to the slow movement of the Schroder recording , I was lulled into ecstasy . Manze , on the other hand takes the slow movement too slow and his tone is uneven during long notes . In one instance he reaches a high note and there is a definite slide up into the note that is very irritating.As a side note , another alternate recording that is almost as good if not as good in it 's own way as the Schroder recording is the one by Elizabeth Wallfisch on Virgin Records - # 61558 ( ASIN : B00000J2PS ) .All in all , the Manze recording of Bach 's Violin Concertos makes for an unsatisfying listening experience . You would be much better off with the Schroder or Wallfisch recording .	-1
I bought this cd because one of my friends liked them and I figured that there was a reason why . So I picked it up , thinking that Lagwaggon would rule and stuff . Nope . This album is just bad music . Sure Angry Days is listenable , and the remake of Bad Moon Rising is novel , but other then that , save your money . I hear that newer Lagwaggon stuff is good . But I 've been scorn for life from this cd .	-1
So i go and buy this tape ... What a joke while the lyrics are good . The music is horrible ... Mabey i 've gone crazy but , this cd sucks	-1
Well everyone gave this great reviews honestly I do n't see whats so special about it . No punk , this is not punk at all . I like the beats , but the songs do n't have that certain punkishness to them.Maybe it 's just cuz I 've been spoiled by Greenday , and Offspring , stuff like that , which is true punk . Man , I could of sworn I heard this on the easy listening station , haha .	-1
The songs on here are really good , but the recording quality sounds like balls ! ! It sounds like they play the guitars using the neck pickup the whole time ! You can hardly make out the chords/notes most of the time ! It 's very annoying after a while . This is one of their earlier albums so I do n't expect it to sound amazing . But like I said , the songs are great in typical Gim me Gim me fashion . Must have for a gim me gim me fan , but I would get blowing in the wind or love their country first if you 're new to the Gim me Gimmes .	-1
This CD is the only Jones CD that covers her entire career , but is dubbed from disc and sounds appalling . Although restricted to her All Platinum recordings , the 'Your Precious Love & quot ; collection is at least taken from original tapes , although recording quality is not perfect.Followers of the deep soul movement of the early '70s will definitely find the late Ms. Jones to their taste .	-1
Using `` Golden Classics '' as a selling point for this CD is REALLY stretching things ... .A LOT ! OK , so two or three of the 14 cuts on this release may have made it on Your Hit Parade , it 's pretty safe to say the remaining cuts never even got a cardboard sales award ! It is rumored that The Beatles were inspired by Anita 's hit recording of the `` Music Man '' gem , `` Till There Was You '' to cut their own version of the song . `` Paper Roses '' is probably the single record Bryant is best remembered for ... but even this record has been overshadowed by Marie Osmond 's hit cover some years later , which pretty much made Anita 's recording stale and forgotten . After a string of modestly selling albums for Columbia , the label dumped her long before her well known hate crusade against gays , indicating her career was in trouble years before she claimed political adversaries had derailed it . Her last album for Columbia was a pathetic dud of a love theme album that really showcased Anita 's failing vocal abilities along with cornpone arrangements that would put a monkey infused with gallons of Starbucks to sleep . At that time , and sadly , the singer 's voice was becoming dark , leathery and unappealing with a drastic loss of range long before its time . But on she forged with the sacred label Word out of Wacco , Texas . It seemed like a solid home for the often sacred singer , but Anita 's output with the label lacked inspiration and all their efforts paled in comparison to her sacred releases with Columbia ( especially the pop-inspriational Columbia album , `` I Beleive '' ) . Certainly the most embarassing release of her entire career was a lack-luster , unspired live religious album with Word which was released not long before they showed her the door ( most likely due to massive compliants from record buyers offended by Bryant 's hate crusades , along with dismal record sales and that failing voice ) . On this live recording , the singer offered unending testimonies about how she was grand enough to lead her flocks to The Lord if they bought her records and books ... it was obvious that Anita now believed The Lord was an employee of Anita Bryant ministries ... the time left on the LP consisted of poorly performed & darkly arranged sacred tunes . Along her career path , Bryant managed to write a long series of books for religious publishers mostly offering Anita 's guidence on how to have a perfect family like her 's . However , even her most ardent supporters jumped off The Good Gospel Ship Anita Bryant , after she dumped her first husband , the father of her children and the co-subject of her happy family sagas . One of the last straws for her public was an outlandish , interview Anita Bryant actually granted with Playboy magazine ... where she discussed everything from her political crusades to her orgasims . To top it all , reports have surfaced that one of Anita 's sons has been outted as being gay . With a career that nose-dived into financial ruin and a failing voice , bankruptcies were not far away via theaters Bryant and her latest husband established in places like Branson , Missouri and Pidgeon Forge , Tennesse , that went bottoms-up , while Anita prayed with casts & employees , guarenteeing the Lord 's blessing on everyone that stuck with her ... she would secretly 'get out of Dodge ' , leaving a few ticket holders in the lurch , and bilking employess and fellow performers out of back pay , including one of her loyal fan club members . Many believe it was actually her failing career , including being dumped by Columbia Records , that prompted MS Bryant to try to jump start her failing career with her ugly policical crusade , rather than any kind of religious conviction . Finding work almost non-existance in this new century , and finding she was n't welcome in several states due to bankruptcies , MS Bryant is reviving `` Anita Bryant Ministeries '' online in a desperate and sadly pathetic attempt at financial survival ... I ca n't help but wonder if she 's seeking a new Playboy interview to bring things full circle ! Unlike everyother artist that was popualr when Bryant enjoyed her biggest success , there has been no interest or demand in issuing her recorded material on CD 's ... with this one exception .	-1
I was quite disappointed upon receiving my copy of this CD after seeing all the 5 star ratings given by other users . The only real standout tracks are the two commonly heard on radio - Green Eyed Lady and Do n't Call Us , We 'll Call You . The rest of both albums are mired in marginal production , sophomoric lyrics and way too much instrumental `` noodling . '' As a keyboardist , I longed to hear more of the great B-3 organ work shown on Green Eyed Lady , but by and large it 's absent . Another minor disappointment is the drumming on these albums , too many flashy attempts at fills and not enough solid groove . Compare Aerosmith 's classic version of Train Kept A Rollin to the lame instrumental version here . I found myself skipping ahead looking for something worth comparing to the two above mentioned tracks and never found it .	-1
I had high hopes for this `` reunion '' album , what with core members Brooker/Trower/Reid/Fischer on board . What made PH one of the best and most unique bands of the late 60s and early 70s was Brooker 's voice and elegant piano , soulful organ work by Chris Copping or Matthew Fischer , Reid 's quirky and often enigmatic or humorous lyrics , a unique talent for blending rock with classical music , and restrained but tasteful guitar work from Trower and his successors in interest after he left the band to go solo . Other than Brooker 's voice , all of those components are missing here . The songs suffer from a similarity in sound/tempo/theme such that you are basically listening to one long song throughout the 12 cuts . I do n't know why Trower or Fischer even came on board , as they are denied soloing and their contributions are buried in a wall of sound type of production that is rife with synthesizers and what sounds like drum machines and which is better suited for disco or techno outings . The songs are mostly `` power pop '' ballads that should have been relegated to the Steve Perry chapter of Journey . Stick with Broken Barricades , Grand Hotel or the band 's other classic outings , and avoid this sad chapter in their career . I blame the producer , not the band , as he shares song credits on many of the tunes on this enterprise .	-1
Puuhlease ! It 's cute but why would you want to waste your time with a second-rate Depeche Mode wannabe synth pop group ? If you want the real deal , check out some early Depeche Mode and Duran Duran .	-1
Back when I was a lad ( well , more of a lad than I am now ) I really dug this record . Every note that Maynard James Keenan sang , roared or bellowed would resonate deeply within mine angst-ridden teenage bosom and his vitriol and rage were as milk and honey to my tortured soul.But that was about five years ago and now I 'm one of those pretentious , artistic types who go in for jaded , circumlocutory reviews such as this one . The point being , of course , that I 'm just too damned relaxed to really enjoy this record.Opiate is not a particularly bad extended player . Certain things can be said in its favour , viz. : i . The rhythm section churns out a particularly violent , plangent undertow upon which Adam Jones wreaks his edgy guitar havoc and the aforementioned Keenan wails and yowls in his heavy-duty tones.ii . The songs that were recorded live , namely Cold And Ugly And Jerk-Off , apart from being downright scary in their thunderous venting of spleen , resonate with uncommon clarity and cohesion.iii . The record is free from the overproduced bombast of Aenima and the too-lengthy psych-outs on Undertow.These things said , however , for me this record is , well , too angry . There 's precious little respite from the ranting and raving and , despite the record 's comparative brevity , by its end I 'm inevitably left feeling a little drained from it all and I ca n't help thinking that perhaps Maynard James should stop being such a negative Nellie .	-1
Your a tool if you like tool ... First of all , i dont know what posses kids to wear korn t-shirts , mudvayne t-shirts to real extreme real concers in the first place ? ! Tool 's music is just plain horrible , boring , unspering , no-talent and is not difirent then your paparoach , korn , avril , & the list goes on & on ! For good talented music do not search for tool or any nu-metal band or cd in the first place -- go else or better ? Search my music and maiby you 'll learn about talent music .	-1
Mediocre at best , but `` Undertow '' is far superior to Tool 's later work . Torture victims from future albums will say : `` Wow ! There are actually songs on this one ! `` I enjoyed some of it , and I would sell it to a store when I wanted to be rid of it , whereas I would chuck `` Aenima '' out the window of my car on the interstate and shout ... as it spun away . I guess that 's a good thing .	-1
This debut from Tool is overrated and is not as interesting as their other albums . The songs and vocals drag on in a repetetive and way and the is little going on to keep me listening.However , tracks like prison sex , sober and bottom are the best they have written - these display more dynamics and variation . Another strong point is that there are no `` filler '' segments like on `` aenima '' between tracks to distract you .	-1
I love Big Star , but ca n't stomach this album . Why someone would want to listen to this and not the originals escapes me . I guess the sound is edgier , more driving , but ultimately you listen to Big Star for the awesome songs . Yet , the voices here are so distracting ( the Posies are too mellodramatic , and Chilton ca n't save the set ) it pretty much wrecks it . Too bad , but I guess they had to prove it could be done .	-1
I was pretty disappointed with this CD . The band sounded really sloppy and much of the show drags . However , that could be blamed on lack of preparation because this was a reunion concert . They seem to be striving for a Badfinger/Wings sound but fall far short of their lofty goals . The two most memorable songs here are both covers ... Marc Bolan 's `` Baby Strange '' and Todd Rundgren 's `` Slut '' . That 's a pretty good indicator of how weak their own material is.I have yet to get the whole Big Star mystique . I saw them last year at Little Steven 's Garage Fest and they were one of the very few low points . My son felt exactly the same way .	-1
I bought this on the recommendation of a friend , and I wish I would have borrowed it from him first . I will admit , there are 2 or 3 good songs on here , but even those are too artsy and weird , and it is n't an organic weird , it sounds forced . I think , personally , that if you do n't like at least 75 % of a CD within the first couple of listens , it is n't worth it . I 've listened to this about 100 times trying to let it grow on me , but I still think it is not that good .	-1
If you went back into the late 90's/early 00 's and asked me what my favorite bands were , I would have gladly answered Tool and Rage Against the Machine . Back then , I thought both bands were such musically-brilliant , insightful bands because of the fact that they were marketed as bands that were heavy metal yet were insightful and thought-provoking , and being the gullable kid I was due to my lack of knowledge of underground music at the time , I ate them both up like hotcakes . For the last seven years or so , I 've been neck-deep in underground metal and industrial bands , and to say that I 've burned my bridges to Tool and RATM would be an understatement . Rather , it would be more appropriate to say that I hijacked a TOS-1 Buratino flamethrower tank and not only decimated said bridges with the tank 's massive thermobaric rocket payload , but also decimated any nearby engineering firms that could have rebuilt those bridges to said alt-metal bands . Okay , enough of my rambling , on to reviewing Tool 's `` Aenima . `` Listening to this album as an adult , I ca n't help but get infuriated by it . This album infuriates me because aside from sounding so drab for being a `` heavy '' rock band , it totally reeks of dishonesty for the fact that it 's marketed as an intelligent slab of music yet it tightly-clings to such juvenille aesthetics that do n't gel at all with aesthetics that are supposed to be `` higher class . '' Even if the juvenille lyrics in some songs are supposed to be ironic humor , it did n't work because I 'm not laughing.MUSICIANS/MUSICIANSHIPWhile many of the musicians here have some instrumental talent by themselves , they do n't win much points from me because they do n't craft much music on this album that I actually like.Maynard James Keenan is an extremely overrated singer . His vocalwork is one of the main reasons why I hate this album , since his vocals usually are either really bad `` anguished '' singing or pseudo-aggressive yelling , in which both styles would be right at home with your run-of-the-mill 90 's nu-metal ( or alternative metal for those who demand euphamisms ) or Nine Inch Nails album ( yuck ) .His songwriting is n't impressive at all , either . So much of his lyrics on this album are like what you 'd read from an angry high schooler 's notebook who 's in an introductory philosophy class , so it 's like a mix of bad , angsty poetry and pseudo-intellectual ramblings . Some songs like `` Fourty Six and Two '' and `` Third Eye '' exemplify the pseudo-intellectual lyrics , while songs like `` Hooker With a Penis '' ( brilliant song title ) have lyrics as if they were yanked straight out of an angry 15 year-old 's mouth.Adam Jones is a guitarist that has skill ( though is inferior to the likes of Chuck Schuldiner and Ron Jarzombek ) , but a lot of what he 's made on this album is really flat and uninspired . The only song where any of his riffs and solos sound like there 's some energy in them are in `` Third Eye , '' while it seems like the rest are just grunge/nu-metal riffs played in an `` artsy '' manner or flat , simplified progressive rock riffs with an occasional polyrhythm . Most of the solos are n't that good , either , since so many of them sound like half-baked , goofy `` feedback '' solos you 'd hear from Tom Morello ( another painfully overrated guitarist ) .Justin Chancellor 's bass is interesting in areas , though nothing that really grabbed my attention . If it counts for anything , at least his bass is more audible in this album than most rock albums out there.Danny Carey is a drummer that 's been showered with tons of praise . Now he is a skilled drummer , but skill with an instrument does n't mean they automatically can make interesting songs . True , in a lot of the songs on this album , Carey does some neat , technical stuff with his skins , but they ca n't save the songs for the fact that so many of them are either boring or downright irritating.SONGSThe only song on this album I 'd say is promising is `` Third Eye . '' In fact , I 'd say that for the most part , it shows that when pressed , Tool 's rhythm section can come up with dynamic , interesting music ( especially since this one clocks in at 14 minutes ) . However , it gets ruined with Maynard 's lousy vocalwork , especially when he screams out `` Prying open my third eye ! ! `` .The `` hit '' songs like `` Stinkfist '' and `` Aenima '' are examples of the grunge/nu-metal songs with an `` artsy '' glaze applied to them , and boy do they sound annoying . They honestly do n't sound much different ( or much better ) than the typical grunge/nu-metal gunk infesting the mainstream at the time this album came out.Other songs like `` Push1t '' and `` Eulogy '' are examples of trying-too-hard-yet-flat progressive-rock with the occasional `` heavy '' moments on this album , and when I 'm not chuckling at Maynard 's attempts to come off as a deep thinker , I 'm usually wallowing in boredom over how bloodless most of them feel.There 's filler tracks like `` Message to Harry Manback , '' `` Intermission , '' and `` Die Eeir Von Satan '' that add next to nothing in terms of musical quality , in that they only pad out the running length of the album.PRODUCTIONThe production quality on this album is n't bad , since all the vocals , guitars , bass , and drums come in rather clear . However , like with all music , good sound quality ca n't save lousy music.FINAL WORDDespite all the heavy marketing and hype from the likes of MTV and Tool fans , this album is NOT a progressive metal masterpiece that will stretch your mind and change your life.If you 're looking for some actual metal albums that have brilliant musicianship , innovative ideas , creativity , or thoughtful lyrics ( or a combination of any ) , I strongly suggest you invest your time and money on these albums instead ( and yes , I 've listened to and own all of these ) : Death : `` Human '' Cynic : `` Focus '' Pestilence : `` Spheres '' Phantasmagory : `` Odd Sounds '' Atheist : `` Piece of Time '' Spastic Ink : `` Ink Complete '' Blotted Science : `` The Machinations of Dementia '' Gordian Knot : `` S/T '' Bunkur : `` Bludgeon '' Neurosis : `` Souls at Zero '' Godflesh : `` Pure '' Blut Aus Nord : `` MoRT '' Pan.Thy.Monium : `` Khaooohs '' Meshuggah : `` Destroy Erase Improve '' Do n't be surprised that if you get engrossed in any of the above albums and own a copy of Tool 's `` Aenima , '' that you find yourself getting rid of said Tool album .	-1
if you do n't like this band and worship the members as gods , you are an inferior being and for that i look down my nose at you even though i 'm only fifteen like i know what the hell i 'm talking about . the benevolent reverend maynard told me to be myself and open my mind to new ideas so i snub people who have different opinions from me . tool are the most amazing , intellectual , spiritual , aesthetically pleasing sonic experience i 've ever had and because of that , i 'm in a class all my own and ca n't be touched . nevermind the fact that aenima has gone platinum and everyone else who owns it thinks the same exact thing . i 'm still my own person and i 'm still better than you because tool are gods . you can come crawling back to me when you 've realized the musical genious and sonic voyage that is tool , and only then will i treat you as an equal . i 'm open minded . i listen to tool.has anyone else had this experience when talking to a tool fan ? they have this single-minded ferocity similar to that of a born-again christian or a member of the 'holy rollers ' . it 's weird.anyway , as for the music , i like the songs eulogy , message to harry manback , hooker with a penis , intermission and die eier von satan . i 'd like the rest if i had n't heard the singles a million times and if the rest did n't get so boring . it just kind of goes on and on , and is n't really as layered as you may be lead to believe by these reviews . BUT this is a fine album for just about everybody . you might as well buy it if you have n't already . whether you like it or not , this album/band is pretty influencial for a lot of bands , even though pretty much all of them [ stink ] ( just about every radioband after '96 or however long it took a band to get together and make an album after listening to aenima , alice in chains , and nirvana . ) i think the fact that this band has a weird cult-like following should say something too . i liked this when i was in high school ( about the time it came out ) , but then i moved on to other kinds of music that have more going on . i 'm past my tool phase.i saw them live too . they sound great , they 're very tight ( not as in 'phat ' , as in they play together exceptionally well ) . the show is great . they dont do much on stage and it helps immensely if you 're high on something . but as for the MUSIC ... only if you like it . the new show is mostly lateralus . i hated lateralus so i hated the show . lateralus was EMPTY and BORING . yeah i said 'empty ' . nothing special . nice visuals from time to time .	-1
Sorry - did n't get it . Liked Undertow & Lateralus thoOverall , Tool 's overrated .	-1
I was listening to a metal radio station and the DJ was talking about how awesome Tool were so I downloaded this album to check them out . WOW . They 're awful . `` Pretentious '' and `` tedious '' would sum up this album . The only cool thing is the computerized vocals . All of the musicians , especially the drummer , sound like they just came out of their first instrument lesson . Horrid musicianship . Skip this lame poser metal and listen to 30 Seconds To Mars , new Metallica , Staind , System Of A Down , etc .	-1
This is probably one of the most overrated albums of modern times . Tool are not bad musicians but they tend to make a mess of albums - and this is their biggest mess of their career . Of the 15 tracks only 8 are songs while the rest is senseless filler segments sandwiched in between songs.Aenima actually starts well and the first songs show some progression from their debut . However the first filler starts on track 4 and here the album turns into an extremely difficult and frustrating experience . The other songs are n't as strong as you again struggle with more filler . Things pickup with & quot ; jimmy & quot ; and the title track before the entire album drowns in endless filler and noise.Had Tool stuck to the no-nonsence format of their debut we may have had a good album.Critics and fans will equate this to genious but these people are the first to be fooled by gimicks and concepts that often mask musical blandness .	-1
Killing Joke 's mix of heavy metal and melodic pop hooks fuel & quot ; Democracy & quot ; into a confused , rather bland set of songs that seem a mix of '70s 'Boston ' , 80 's 'The Cult ' , and 90 's grunge , never identifying itself as the dark post punk distinctive Brit sound Killing Joke is alleged to be , but instead revealing a swirl of many hard rock ideas unfortunately anchored in an '80s time capsule where the beat goes on and on but never seems to get anywhere . The songs too often use the same formula of a grunting hard-edged vocal transforming into a lighter melodic sing-song soft core voice with vibrating 'Cult ' guitars and repetitious , thump , thump , bang , bang , drums that clumsily combine punk with melody . They seem capable of more and a good Producer could have trimmed the clutter and the repetition in a more pronounced vision of social politics , which seems to be the aim here .	-1
After loving their last two albums , I was grossly dissappointed by Democracy . It sounds too dense , too ponderous , and too boring to be considered a four star CD . If you really want to listen to a good representation of Killing Joke , buy Fire Dances or Extremities . Avoid this one as your first taste of Killing Joke . You might not come back for more	-1
Unfortunately there are not many of my Rock n Roll favorites on this . In choosing this cd there was not the possibility to see the list of songs . Had I seen the list , I probably would not have purchased this cd	-1
`` The Man Who Sold the World '' is an album that established a reputation -- David Bowie , pop songster and pyschedelic folkster , did a dramatic about-face and reinvented himself as a dark metal rocker . In 2006 , this sort of reinvention of Bowie is something that was expected , but in 1970 , this must have been rather unexpected . Influencing this change was no doubt the presecne of guitar hero Mick Ronson , whose embracing of distortion and feedback made this entirely possible . The results of this change , quite honestly , are a lot more mixed then most Bowie fans would lead you to believe -- `` The Man Who Sold the World '' has been elevated to cult status and truthfully it 's not that the album is bad per se , it 's just that it 's not particularly exciting.Bowie lets us know right away that things have changed -- `` Width of a Circle '' is an extended cut drenched in feedback and distorted guitars with a galloping bassline ( played by producer Tony Visconti ) and a rambling vocal from Bowie . No doubt it woke a lot of people up as to the change of direction , and it proves to be a decent number . But Bowie seems incapable of really sustaining this and seems unsure how to integrate it into his idiom -- `` All the Madmen '' starts as a bleak acoustic ballad before overdriven guitars and a downright irritating synth line get in the way , `` After All '' ends up being a dull Lou Reedish ballad , and many of the metalish pieces are pretty much unmemorable ( `` She Shook Me Cold '' , the lyrically fantastic `` Running Gun Blues '' ) . The album closes on a high note , with the bizarre folk/metal fusion title track ( made famous decades later by Nirvana 's performance of it on MTV ) and the fractured , paranoid , and downright bizarre metal churn of `` The Superman '' , but the album is a bit too inconsistent to be a completely satisfying listen.There 's enough on here to make it worth a pickup for those exploring Bowie 's catalog , but he 'd do siginificantly better work in the very near future . This one is more a curiosity .	-1
I never cared much for this album and I doubt I ever will . Fame and Young americans are standout tracks but the rest of the songs just sound too much alike . When listened to them seperately they 're enjoyable enough , but played one after the other they become a bit of a drag . Bowie 's voacal delivery on this album is admirable though , it 's just a shame most of his songwriting is not .	-1
Still wondering why I bought this ... .Well recorded but not quite what I was expecting.Maybe you will like it more .	-1
You only need to ask yourself one question . Had Yoko Ono not been married to John Lennon , would any of this ever have seen the light of day ? Maybe one other ... .what does it tell you when a 5 CD box set hits the bargain bins ?	-1
