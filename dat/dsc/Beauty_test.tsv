Even though I use body lotion , I still had flakey skin . This has helped get the dry flakey skin off and my skin now feels and looks great .	1
Who knew that something so simple and inexpensive could make such a difference ? For the past couple years I have suffered from KP ( keratosis pilaris - pretty much bumpy red skin ) . Since I have been dry brushing I have noticed that my red bumps have slowly started to fade and my skin seems much smoother . Another benefit is that my skin seems to absorb lotion better so it is more hydrated . As for cellulite reduction , I ca n't really speak to that yet because I have only been using it for a week or so now , but overall my skin seems more toned and is glowing . For the price , I would definitely recommend .	1
Its so healthy and good for you . Not to mention all over glowing and smooth skin . Need I say more ? THis brand actually makes solid all-natural body brush . Try the dry brushing and you will see it do wonders as it did for me .	1
Love all the different colors of OPI and the different texture of the Liquid Sand . This is a really pretty color with a slight sparkle or glitter to it . I am so happy I purchased this color .	1
Provides good coverage and dries FAST - which is super convenient . Received many compliments on the color . ONly challenge is the tips can snag a bit due to the rough texture , a fine nail file fixes this easily !	1
I am in love with this color and texture I am a amateur self taught nail artist I 've been dying to get my hands on the liquid sand versions of opi , I 'm hooked and ca n't wait to order more ( since my sallys does n't sell them ) I got this and honey ryder and love them instantly	1
I do n't really care for the other textures I 've tried from OPI . But this one is great . Looks like freshly fallen snow . Wears like iron . It 's not really gritty like sandpaper , like with Zoya or Julie G , but more like bumpy under the smooth polish ( if that makes sense lol ) . If you can find this it 's worth it .	1
Love this color . I use it a lot as an accent color because of the texture , it looks great with red and blue to bring out your 4th of July mani . Also , if you really like detail , it is good to use as snow for the Christmas or winter mani .	1
very pretty . Looks like snow on my fingers and has great staying power . It does take 3 coats to make it opaque .	1
Omg , I just love this nail polish it is a beautiful color and it looks lovely on the nails , I just order the pink , blue , and the purple this product is a five +++++	1
I purchased this to go with another white opi glitter polish and it is a perfect match . The texture stands out but the color blends in and gives you a nice variety on the nails .	1
I could NOT resist the name of this polish , and while I do n't have a ton of sand polish effects , this one seemed pretty good . It was really pretty and modestly feminine on and had some nice subtle sparkle . I liked it and will wear this again .	1
I absolutely love this liquid sand stuff , beautiful color and it lasts FOREVER ! It has been more than a week , and my nails look the same way they did the first time . I will always buy these , perfect for a busy lifestyle and a perfect mani .	1
This is a cotton candy pink color . It 's labeled as liquid sand . You ca n't see that in the picture . When applied it looks really glittery , but when it dries ... It 's a rough finish ( hence the liquid sand ) no amount of topcoat will make it shiny.That aside , it 's really pretty on & in the sun really sparkles !	1
I really love this polish ! I like to pair it up with the gold or white sands colors . It is a beautiful soft pink ? This is one of my favorite & # 34 ; go to colors & # 34 ; . It reminds me of my favorite cashmere sweater !	1
I bought this for my wife after she had it applied at a salon and she loves it . It barely chips she said because of the & # 34 ; sand & # 34 ; texture and is much more interesting than regular nail polish . Plus , it is fun , but can still be worn at work for some added pop . Great year round she said too .	1
`` Seriously '' , you have to laugh at this polish name ( from the Bond movie Goldfinger ) . I do love the texture and the lovely fine sparkle it has - it is a pretty , soft , light , pink ( and I normally do not like light pink ) . It does dry to a matte finish ( all the OPI liquid sand polishes do that I have encountered so far ) .	1
Absolutely love it ! ! It is a great color . I love OPI . I am really glad I got this color . I highly recommend OPI .	1
The texture is amazing , the light touch of glitter . Just absolutely love it ! ! I also bought the silver one `` solitaire '' even better than this color , I love them both just one better than the other haha	1
I love this polish ! ! ! I got it to go with What Wizardry Is This ? . So glad I did ! It 's a stunning soft gold . It goes on nicely with just one coat , although 2 makes it look even better ! I ordered from Nail Polish and More and got it in literally 2 days ! Defiantly a 5 star polish !	1
Never tried liquid sand ... ... it is Fantastic . Ladies with no time will love that it dries quickly . It adds pizazz to your fingertips . I rub my finger on it constantly because it is so textured it doe not seem like nail polish at all . The have many other colors in the OPI brand . Everyone that loves to change colors often must try liquid sand . The look is automatically dressy and classy ! ! I received so many compliments I had to buy my own bottle .	1
I normally do n't like texture polish but I do like this one . However , since I like a glassy top , I do wear a good topcoat over this . The texture still shows , but the top is smooth to the touch . Very pretty . Very pleased with seller , well wrapped and timely delivery .	1
This is a nice color i paired it with a sparkle polish for an easter egg effect and it held up well and looked amazing ! !	1
Soft gold color , formular is nice and this polish is a nice accent with any other color but can certainly stand alone . Texture is nice and not overly thick . Came quick and I just love it .	1
I read , heard , and saw a ton of reviews on this pencil so I finally just got it . I ordered on the 24th and received on the 26th , with regular ground shipping . The pencil really gives a good base for eye shadows . I would n't suggest using as a substitute , but only in addition to a primer - even concealer if that 's what you use . It gives a really good base for colors - bright and natural , and has great texture . A definite Recommend . Also , came with the little pink earrings . Just as shown in the picture .	1
Arrived in a timely fashion and in great condition . The top cracked , but i think that was my doing in pushing it down too far . Love this product . Great to use as a primer before applying eyeshadows . It really helps make my eyes POP !	1
Absolutely the best eye primer . Lasts all day and makes your makeup look really pigmented . Stays in place does n't sweat off and because its a pencil it ill last a long time . Going to stock up on these . Also the price is reasonable .	1
this pencil is great for priming the eyelids before the application of shadows . it is also great for the water line to brighten up the eyes . the price was good and and its hard to find at places where they sell NYX product because its usually sold out . i RECOMEND this product . -XOAuriBeautyXOAuriBeauty.blogspot.com	1
I love this sun shield because it soaks into the skin and does not mess up my makeup when I addthat over the sun shield . It 's great !	1
I mix this sunscreen with my Murad oil control moisturizer , and it is perfect . I have oily skin , and this combination works great . Takes away the oiliness , gets completely absorbed by my skin , and does not leave any film or greyisch color on the skin . Really like this sunscreen . I do n't like the greasy heavy feeling and/or smell that most facial sunscreens have . With this one you do n't feel anything is on your skin .	1
I like that my face is n't all shiny . This new matte sunblock is great ! It glides on smoothly over and under make up	1
AWESOME PROTECTION BUYING MORE MUST LEAVE ON YOUR FACE 15 MINS BEFORE GOING OUT IN THE SUNAND MUST RE APPLY	1
I use it everyday , but know in summer I highly recommended , I live in PR and we have sun , all year long ! Since in Matte docent feels greasy ... is like wearing nothing , but you know you are protected !	1
This is my favorite sunscreen . It has a great matte finish . It absorbs quickly with no excess shine . Works well under makeup .	1
Great product . Nice smell . Chock full of fabulous herbalAnd natural ingredients that are only seen in other high end coutureFacial products for a fraction of the price . I 'm a fan and willRebuy . Ca n't afford department store prices and love how it refinedMy skin for a great price !	1
I luckily inherited good skin to begin with , but after using this product for six weeks , it 's even better ( just ordered my second bottle ) . When applied ( to clean skin of course ) , you can feel the tightening . It leaves no residue . Once dried , apply your moisturizer . This product is worth every penny you pay for it . Highly recommend it to help preserve as much of your youthful appearance as possible .	1
the serum smells light/clean and glides on matte . I use less than a dime-sized amount & let it dry before applying an organic SPF face cream . sometimes i use stand-alone if i will be indoors all day . I 'm 37 , look young for my age despite a fair amount of sun damage from when i was a teenager and thought I 'd never regret a deep tan . 4 weeks after using the serum and my skin feels plump & hydrated throughout the day , fine lines are less apparent and I 've received several compliments on how young I look and that my skin is `` radiant . '' I wash my face with the sweetsation very berry masque and scrub , use an occasional organic pineapple peel , and the I*bright under eye cream from sweetsation . I also just began taking collagen supplements for skin hair and nails . it 's difficult to pinpoint which products are doing what , but I am happy with the results !	1
I would highly recommend this skin care line to anyone who wants glowing skin . I would recommend using the serum with both the day cream and night cream ! your skin will thank you.. trust me ! ! !	1
overall you can not go wrong with hyaluronic acid , this product is definitely the best smelling on , but for the price I will do without the smell and buy from timeless skin care a big bottle with a dropper	1
I am updating my review and rating it 4 stars instead of 3.Since the previous review I have been putting this serum on my skin MORNING and NIGHTrather than just once a day and I am seeing a definate improvement in skin tone.I use it under a SPF30 Zinc sunscreen during the day and under a moisturizer at night. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- This was my previous 3 star review.This seemed to dry out my skin and my skin would burn when Istarted excercising and sweating.I used this with Ponds moisturizer during the night and with Blue Lizard sunscreenduring the day . I will use it until the bottle is empty to seeif it just needs more time for my skin type .	1
After trying so many product on the market , I can say that I finally found the one and the perfect one , it feels really good on the skin LOVE IT	1
Love this serum , very effective ... a lil dry but it moisturize very well . Actually is great for summer time because is not greasy at all .	1
First of all I have to say that I have been using Sweetsation Therapy products for about 1 year and my skin has never looked better . And I love the fact that they are organic.I had never used a serum before and I decided I needed to give it a shot . Since I have been using the serum , my skin looks so much smoother and tighter . I usually use it in the morning right after I apply the toner . I give it a few minutes and then I apply the daily moisturizer from Sweetsation Therapy . Great product ! ! ! !	1
I received a sample of this , and after using it for a couple of weeks now , I am so afraid to run out , I ordered a full size and it is scheduled to arrive today ( just tracked it ) ... 2 days earlier than the earliest promised date , I would like to add ! I was also surprised to see the price was lower than I had anticipated for this kind of product.I have reviewed several other SweetSation products , as I ADORE them and ca n't say enough good things about them . They are very clever , sending free samples of other products with each order , and I keep getting hooked with each sample - though I am not complaining ! ! ! My skin is glowing thanks to these products.Before talking about LaNouvel , I want to mention LumiEssence . I am over 43 and have a bit of sun damage on my skin , most recently from a road trip when I did n't think to reapply sunscreen in the late afternoons for the setting sun . I know , stupid . And my skin was showing it . Until I started using LumiEssence ( free sample struck again ! You can read my full review of this if interested ... ) LumiEssence , used once a day at night immediately started to brighten my skin and diminish the sunspots . They did n't go away right away , but they softened to look more like slight tan rather than dark , hard edged spots . And my skin really looked brighter right away ! I did n't even know any products would do this.SO then I started using LaNouvel about a month ago ... I have recently begun to get some wrinkles ... the beginning of wrinkles . I am lucky that they have come later to me than most of my friends my age , I think largely due to my diligent use of SweetSation products . But eventually we must all get wrinkles , and mine finally started . I am THRILLED to report that since I started using LaNouvel , in these 4 weeks , my wrinkles have actually lessened ! My skin seems to be making more collagen or something ... it looks so great and feels wonderful . I keep seeing myself in the mirror w/o makeup , and thinking , wow , I look younger and so good ! And that is not a normal thing for me . It seems to be boosting the effects of the LumiEssence , also , as my skin looks even more fresh and bright . I am sure to put it on my `` decolette '' also , where my age had really started to show , and wow . That looks younger , too ! YIPPEE ! And LaNouvel smells SOOOO good . It has a light , sort of rose scent , but there is something else in the smell I ca n't quite pinpoint . It glides on after my toner , and as soon as it dries , I put either QLumiere ( day ) or LumiEssence ( night ) over it and my skin feels amazing.Thank you SweetSation for yet another fantastic product that is helping me to keep aging skin at bay ! I LOVE YOU ! : - )	1
Feels very good and smells great , I love this serum and definitely will purchase another one . I have used different , more expensive serum , by far , this is the best !	1
This has really improved my skintone and has helped with fine line when used along with the aqua tica it has done wonders for my skin.Look forward to using other products I have not tried from this brand .	1
I like this product . I think it is on par with other serums and of course the huge benefit is that it 's not full of bad chemicals . It 's not an earth-shattering product or anything , but I 've never found one that is .	1
This is a great product and it definitely makes your overall skin look much younger . Big plus that is all natural . love it . just do n't over do it .	1
I absolutely love the LaNouvel Cellular NutriSerum with Hyaluronic acid , Collegen/ Elastin & Peptides . I use it on my face with Vitamin C twice a day . The bottle lasts quite a while . Fine lines have diminished and I 've seen a huge improvement in my skin texture .	1
I purchased this as soon as it came out and am very pleased with the results on my now-dry and aging skin . Added to my regular Sweetsation Therapy regimen , it 's helped the skin around my eyes and the lines around my mouth ( those are more like crevasses ! ) firm up and become less prominent ; the skin on my face is brighter and tone much more even . The many dark spots I have are slowly , slowly fading and my skin feels soft , not dry and scaly . Nothing in this line of skin care products is a quick fix - consistent , diligent use is the key to the best results . *Addendum 6/7/2013 : I continue to use this product ; combined with a regular regimen ( especially when I remember to wash , tone and moisturize twice a day as recommended ) my skin tone ( fraught with dark , light and in-between patches ! ) continues to even out . The deep creases on the sides of my mouth have lessened , even though I 've lost about 25 lbs . since I began using Sweetsations and have lost fat from my face and neck . Extending the use of LaNouvel Cellular NutriSerum LIGHTLY onto the throat area has helped erase some of the `` crepe '' effect of the now-loose skin . I remain a dedicated Sweetsation Therapy fan !	1
I first tried this when it was sent as a free sample when I purchased their Brightening Eye Treatment ( which I also love ! ) . I liked it so much I had to buy it ! My skin tends to be a bit dry and sensitive so this serum was a perfect fit for me . After I put it on , it feels like it provides a moisture boost to my skin and leaves it feeling soft and smooth . I have noticed my pores seem smaller too . I 'm getting to that age ( 35 ) where I notice my skin is showing slight signs of age , so every little bit of positive change I can make I 'm going to keep doing ! I have really enjoyed this product and I would definitely recommend it .	1
I 'm a huge fan of this company and I was eagerly anticipating the release of this product and it was well worth the wait . My skin has been super dry from a combination of nursing and just being so freaking busy trying to keep the kids from literally climbing the walls that I forget to hydrate . With its Hyaluronic acid , the LavNouvel NutriSerum is a well needed drink for my thirsty skin as it pulls in moisture . I use it with the Q*Lumi & egrave ; re Day or the Aqua*Tica Night cream and it has perked my skin up immensely in just the first week alone . This serum positively glides on and has a light scent that mixes well with their other range of products . I ca n't wait to see what happens to my skin as I continue to use it.Sidebar : my husband surprised me with a birthday visit to a spa and the esthetician who did the facial could n't find fault with my skin care routine ( albeit she did remind me to drink more water ) and she said that hyaluronic acid was one of the best things you can do for your skin .	1
This is my second buy of this awesome vegan serum . I am a nutritionist and a vegan and I 'm very particular about what I eat and what skincare I use . This LaNouvel Hyaluronic acid Nutriserum deserves five stars because it meets all the criteria of an antioxidant/anti-aging/vegan/paraben free powerhouse ingredients that delivers a smooth , flawless and youthful vibrant glow . I 'm hooked . Sweetsation you got a customer for life if the formulation stays the same . Thank you sweesation therapy for this great vegan serum .	1
This stuff really works - I have always had enormous pores under one eye and this serum is the first product I have ever used that seems to tighten them us ! I am so pleased and it lasts forever - I got a small sample size and when it 's empty I use the container to transfer from the larger bottle and that works so well for me . Love it !	1
Not one complaint about this stuff . It is awesome . I use it along with 100 % night balm and could n't have a better routine which I searched for years . Also bought the Very Berry Masque which again is awesome	1
I am so happy that I came across the reviews of Sweetsation 's products on Amazon ! I am now in love with this line of skincare ! ! I like that the products are made with great , all-natural ingredients and the fact that they actually work . I have been using LaNouvel Cellular NutriSerum for about 2 weeks and my face already looks so healthy and glowing . I will continue to use all Sweetsation items !	1
I also tried the LaNouvel Cellular NutriSerum . This is also another wonderful product ! It is full of ingredients like Collagen , Hyaluronic Acid and more . So what exactly does this product do ? It helps provide wonderful moisture to the skin . My skin felt amazing after using it . The product helps do a number of things , but I am in love with the brightening effect and intense moisturizing that it provides . I also love that this product will not clog pores . Moisturizing is super important to me , but sometimes it can cause me to break out . This product does not.Sample was provided for my blog review .	1
First off this polish came in a decent time . It 's the exact color as the picture and most importantly it did n't come crushed ! I 'm so mad at this other company that I ordered from and now I 'm out $ 10 because they 're refusing to do anything about it . This is a must buy , great price !	1
This color is STUNNING ! I 've spent so long trying to find the perfect , bright , sunshine yellow and this is it ! it 's not dusty , a pastel , a neon or a highlighter . It 's just pure , warm yellow !	1
Love this polish . I know it was intended to be a summer polish , but the yellow hue almost perfectly matches the fall colors of the maple trees around my house . It was opaque in two coats , on day two with no tip wear or chipping .	1
At first I fell in love with this color and just had to have it . When I received it and tried it on my nail it looked like any other teal . I still like but , it 's nothing unique about it .	1
Color is bright and vivid . Zoya goes on so smoothly there is almost no need to worry about streaks . Love it !	1
This is a very pretty bright lemon yellow . Goes on smoothly but does need a few extra coats since it has some streaks when applying .	1
This may be my favorite polish I 've purchased recently . It 's a delicious shade of green that does n't scream & # 34 ; I 'm a teenager ! & # 34 ; ( no offense to the teens out there - rock your polish like only you guys can ) .	1
I love this color . The formula is great too . I usually use Shellac and rarely use regular nail polish but I could n't resist this color . It has great staying power ! ! ! Highly recommend .	1
Awesome shade of green . Sorry zoya : I had planned to buy a Bunch more colors this summer but , I do n't need any other color . I love it !	1
The color is so cute and the polish glides on smooth . It does n't chip for longer than other polishes I have tried and it does n't have any of the nasty chemicals you find in ither brands . Would definitely recommend !	1
These lipstick holders are very sturdy and can hold several different brands of lipstick , which has been helpful . I like to have my most used lipsticks on display rather than hiding in a drawer somewhere and this helps me do just that .	1
I really love this although it does n't hold some lipsticks such as the black label nyx , but other then that its great to have	1
I use this for nail polish it fits my Art Deco nail stripers , Julep polish , Hard Candy 's round bottles , revlon nail art polishes amazing value works great	1
I was looking for something to help me organize my makeup and this is it . It came super fast and is a great way to keep my lippies organized . They fit my mac , wet & wild , lipgloss , chapstick , and lancome lipsticks . Highly recommend and will be buying again . great gift too .	1
I have several of these . I use two for lipsticks , one for mascara and eyeliner , and one for eyeshadow sticks . These things really gave me my dresser back .	1
It 's so small and cute . I thought it would take up a lot of space , but was pleasantly surprised . Great to display my high end lipsticks	1
Use it to hold lips sticks . mascara lip liners etc..	1
This is a must have if your obsessed with lipsticks and need something to organize and keep them in . I love this and recommend it .	1
This is great ! It fits perfectly on my makeup vanity/desk , all my lipsticks and glosses fit . Will definitely be ordering a couple more for my nail polish and other little things .	1
I needed this because I have so many lipsticks and sticking them in a makeup bag just makes me forget them . This works out great and the price was right .	1
Perfect for my lip products . Just a cheap plastic thing . Decent price . Would buy again .	1
This took FOREVER to arrive . Surprisingly it came in great shape and it serves its purpose , although the material is not the highest quality kind out there , still a great little holder .	1
Pros : Fits various kinds of lipstick tubes however I think that the higher slots are wider because the same lipstick that fits up top does n't fit below.Cons : It 's sturdy however if I dropped it from off the counter it may just break.The shipping was long ( about 3 wks ) that I forgot I ordered it . LoLWorth it and I 'm ordering another one .	1
I own several of these to help keep my lipsticks and glosses together . The sections are a little small for some of my lipsticks .	1
I love this case . I use it not only for my lipsticks but also my lip glosses and mascaras . It holds them all perfectly . It 's sturdy and strong and does n't take up too much space .	1
This is exactly what I 've been looking for ! It holds all of my lipsticks perfectly , including : MAC , NYX , Victoria 's Secret , etc . It also holds my lip glosses and chapsticks . The price was on point and it arrived prior to the expected delivery date and it perfect condition .	1
I have acne prone skin . Have dark spot from acne . I use antibiotic lotion a very little . This pack is amazing I love the fragrance from this mask . We use lot of mint in the food due to its health benefit . Did n't know it is good for skin also . I use it 2 times a week for the whole face and use it every day as spot treatment on my acne spots and scars . If it clean my skin with this the . Apply the antibiotic on the my skin , the results are fabulous it reduces the acne very fast . He fully one day I will get rid of all my acne and just use this one . Face looks neat and clean after the face wash . Naturally beautiful I should say : )	1
I have only used maybe one facial mask in the past , so I was n't sure what to think about this dead sea mask . The great thing about this mask is that it is n't chocked full of chemicals , as it contains only 100 % of natural and organic ingredients . Upon opening I immediately noticed the smell . The mud actually smells great . Upon applying it felt cool and actually pretty nice . It applies a dark green to dark grey , and in ways you may look like Shrek , however this is way worth it . It tightens while drying on your skin , and have no doubt it 's helping tone and clear my skin of oil . I do however frown on the amount in one container . It seems like it takes a lot to cover my face . Therefore , I do n't think one one bottle will last a whole long time , maybe 4 or at most 5 treatments . However , as long as it works , I would n't have a problem buying it often . At this time , I have no reason not to rate it 5 stars . Recommend to anyone who wants to get a spa like treatment at home .	1
I love it and use once a week . It goes deep , pulls out the oils , reduces pore size , firms and tightens your skin . Feels minty , very cool and tingly after using and smells wonderful . Great product .	1
I have sensitive skin , and large pores and I 've found it difficult to find a product that will clear out my pores without being too harsh . Well , this product does the trick ! I used it for just the second time and when I rinsed it off , all of my pores were completely clear of residue ! Did not leave my skin reddened , just clear and healthy looking ! I would definitely recommend this product for anyone who suffers from both sensitive skin and large pores .	1
I got this when it was on sale for $ 16 . For this price compared to other products it should be a no brainer to get.Product wise this is almost like any other facial mask you can use , as to be honest unless your buying some really shady product they all seem to have some beneficial aspects one way or the other.. what I can say is that this product did n't disappoint !	1
Works perfectly , smells minty , and leaves my face incredibly soft and smooth after every use . And for the price , I could n't ask for anything else .	1
I 'm always looking for all natural beauty products because I do n't like to use chemicals on my skin . This is a wonderful facial mask and fits the bill . My teenaged daughter and I both use it . I have to say I love it .	1
I think that this product is doing a good job of softening my skin . Have only been using it for about 2 weeks , and I do n't notice any reduction in wrinkles yet , but it IS early . It 's pleasant to use , not heavy and comes in a push pump bottle.Add : Although I really like this product , it 's running out rather quickly . Although the pump measures the `` dose '' , and I have n't overused the product , I am running out already !	1
Probably one of the best Collagen products I have used . I 'll see how it works as I use it longer .	1
I have seen a difference in minimizing some fine lines . The only reason why i rate 4 stars is because not all lines are gone . Maybe with longer use they may be gone . I like the lightweight serum and it absorbs quickly . There is not a sticky feeling to it .	1
I have been using three weeks now and my skin looks and feels great . As far as helping with wrinkles they seem to be disappearing but to early to make that decision .	1
I may rated this higher but have n't been using it long enough to make a determination to the quality of results received	1
The collagen serum is very light and goes on smoothly . It has helped the wrinkles on my face and I 've been using it daily under my moisturizer . Just wish the bottle had a better pump . Too much of the serum comes out in one pump .	1
I 've been using this product for a couple months after I was tired of spending $ 50+ dollars on Lancme serum . It worked great at first . I noticed dark spots fading around my mouth and wrinkles seemed to become finer . No major changes though . Now the product has slowed in its ability to further remove my dark spots . I will order it again though because I had the same results with the Lancme serum . I have now combined a cleanser with glycolic acid to get rid of those stubborn dark spots .	1
I really like this product . No , it 's not an injection . I agree the marketing is a bit confusing . You will NOT get the results of an injected product with a topical product . So you have to have realistic expectations . That said , Argireline can reduce motion and softens wrinkles . ( Reduce , not completely freeze or eliminate . ) I 've reordered this product and do n't want to be without it ! I bought it because of the 20 % Argireline . I ca n't afford Botox and would rather skip the injections . It may take a while to `` build up '' . I think I noticed results after a couple weeks . I use the product only on my forehead and I layer applications . This product is a bit thick and feels sticky at first , but it soaks in quickly and very cleanly . So I put one layer on my freshly washed face and let it dry . I add another thin layer and let it dry . Sometimes I 'll add a third layer just focusing on the forehead `` 11s '' . Then I can put moisturizer over . This is all for a.m. application , and keep in mind that I have very strong `` frown muscles '' . It does n't completely freeze my forehead , but it definitely softens the `` frownies '' ! ! ! I honestly notice a difference.Though I do multiple applications , I do only focus on my forehead , so one bottle still lasts a couple months . I use Porcelain Skin 's Skin Firming Activating with DMAE , Alpha Lipoic Acid , Vitamin C , and Hyaluronic AcidB00A7LPEMGon the rest of my face.With these products , as well as alternating Tretinoin cream and a glyocolic cream at night , my skin is looking good !	1
It really helps hold in moisture and helps your moisturizer stay on better too . I will reorder this product . Only takes a little product .	1
I purchased the Protoxyn Anti-Aging Serum approximately 10 days ago and have used it every day morning and in the evening . I first heard about the benefits of argireline from a plastic surgeon that was a guest on the Dr. Oz Show . He recommended using a serum with at least a 10 % argireline content . This plastic surgeon said the results would be similar to Botox . I was skeptical . After using it approximately 10 days , I really do see a difference . This serum also contains Vitamin C which is very beneficial to your skin and Matrixyl 3000 which promotes collagen growth . Make no mistake about it , it 's not surgery or botox , however , my lines are much less noticeable and what I noticed most is my eye area and forehead . I do get botox treatments but I feel with this product I can stretch my treatments further apart which will save me money . I do use and have tried a lot of products . However , it was n't until this argireline that I really could see a vast difference . If you try this product , you need to be diligent about using it every day . Use a good moisturizer after a few minutes . I use Lamer cream with this serum . You will start noticing a difference in a few weeks . I 'm in my late forty 's and frantically trying to stop the aging process . Anyway , it works for me and if you are up there in age , it is worth a try . I 've used several expensive products and this worked much better . I really like this product and I will continue to order this .	1
At first , i have to ADMIT , i was NOT impressed with it ...

I have bought this a week ago and already see and feel a difference . Will be buying more ! Thank you so much ! ! : )	1
Very pleased with this order . I ordered this and the Pureen Buffet stamping set at the same time . I got them quickly . They seem to be etched well except for 1 image on 1 plate . From what I 've seen of others who have used that image , they have had issues with etching on that one too . The details are so fine , I think it 's just hard to etch it deep enough without making it too deep.Overall , I am very pleased with the purchase . This was my first from Pureen and I will order from them again if/when they have more new plates .	1
I was a little skeptical about trying yet another stamping company , but these images are clear , easy to stamp , and there 's something for everyone in this set ! The case that comes with the set takes a bit getting used to , I am used to having my plates displayed side-by-side , but it 's a great solution for travel , and keeping them in an easy , compact and organized place . I will try to upload a photo of my latest mani using one of these plates .	1
I am super happy with my purchased . I really liked all the designs and they work really good . I have used them with the special nail stamping polish and regular nail polish and has work really good . I recommend this bundle of stamping plates	1
For the first time someone packaged some plates in a super cute leather like case where you can pull out each of the plates and show them before deciding which one you want to use . convenient and innovative . I wound up buying another case and there bigger case that houses I think 132 plates ! in Hot Pink . Great Deal	1
When I saw these plates I had to have them . I really liked all the images and having bought the first set of Pueen plates I did n't think there would be any issues with the quality . I was right : ) .The shipping time was reasonable , ordered on 8th May and received on 14th May . When the plates came , they came in a white plastic pueen envelope inside a bubble padded shipping envelope so they were well packaged to avoid damage . One of the plates the first one had a deep scrape across it ( this had to have happened prior to shipping ) but that was only on the plastic , the plate itself was undamaged.The case I got was white and it was perfectly fine no damage no discolouration and very cute . The little screw on the bottom was a bit loose but I understand that this can be tightened . The little plastic envelopes inside the case were quite flimsy , it felt like the slightest thing and they would tear but since I have something else to store my plates in that does n't matter to me.The plates are the standard plate size but they are ever so slightly thinner than a Konad plate The edges are rounded so its not sharp like some others . There are different sized full nail images all of which are way bigger than the images on my other plates ( used Konad M057 to compare ) . Most of the images are wide enough to just cover my nails but I do have wider nail beds so it will be more than large enough for most people . The images were all really nice , in fact out of all the plates there are probably one of two IMAGES that I might not use . The images are sharp and clear.All in all good quality plates , pretty images and a nice case .	1
LOVE LOVE LOVE the new Love Elements stamp collection ! GREAT assortment shipped in a wonderful little case , perfect for storage ! Awesome number of designs ! Each plate has unique images which go tiogether wonderfully . Both full-nail and single image designs included . HIGHLY RECOMMEND !	1
I got this set specifically for one of the star designs , its hard to use the other plates in this set and my other plates I own because I just love the stars so much ! But this set has very nice full nail designs , prettier than most . I have incorporated them into MANY designs , especially over gradients it looks incredible.The designs on this set are really nice , there 's lots of generic hearts you can use whenever not just Valentine 's Day which is great , I like hearts year round , right now my nails are stamped with one of the heart designs from this set and there are a few specifically for Valentine 's Day like they have words written into the design , the plates stamp decent , the designs are deep enough , they pick up well , etc . When I ordered it , mine even came with a free case which was really nice and better than what other companies offer . I would buy this brand again if there 's another set with designs I like .	1
I have the first set of pueen plates as well . This manufacture has it figured out . This second set works great just like the first . Although this set is more feminine than the other one . The full nail designs are large but they do not have the moon shape at the bottom for French tips like their first set . Images transfer beautifully comparable to Konad . It also comes it a cute case . If you love nail art like me , it is a must for your collection . Check out my nail art slide show.https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=8mI6RWODtc0 & feature ; =youtube_gdata_player	1
I love this set , the images are all so pretty and there does n't seem to be any defects/problems that actually affect the stamp ( though there was some discoloration on a few plates ) . I have n't tried out all of the images , but the ones that I have tried have all been easy to use and stamp .	1
These image plates have a lot of beautiful designs , Their whimsy and romantic style is for far more than just Valentines day ! For never having heard of the pueen brand I am really pleased with the quality , they are paper backed which helps keep down the sharp edges , etched well and have the typical blue sticker that covers the plates , these come off with great ease unlike some other brands I 've seen . The designs are plenty wide and I like that most of the images are for full nails , There are n't any french manicure designs and only a few of the tiny ones . My only complaint is that some of the designs are very busy and you do n't really realize just how busy they are until you have stamped them . I noticed this especially with one of the rose lace designs , the fish net style in the background made it a little hard to see exactly what it was once stamped .	1
This is a very cute collection comes with a great holding case at a great price many cute designs .	1
Love the designs , and so far everything comes out very clear !	1
I love the variaty of designs in this set . The images come out crisp and clean everytime . I have this set as well as the first one and love them both !	1
Beautiful set of stamping plates ! I am so glad that I purchased these ! They stamp clear and transfer on to nails wonderfully .	1
I have ordered the pueen plates 1-25 and loves them so i wanted to get the love elements too ! these have lots of lacey whimsical images . and a white holding case ! this time there was paper at the end of the plastic so the leather didnt stain the plastic ! ( not like my other one ) I got a white case of course , my favorite color ! One of my places did have a scratch across it but thats okay because i didnt like those images anyway , also there was discoloration on one of my plates.. ill upload a pic.. Overall Amazing . This set is now added to my collection of Plates !	1
Beautiful and the designs are awesome ... i 'm about to use my Plates by tomorrow . I know it 's gon na turn out great	1
These were just as they seem . Nice prints and they worked very well . I will be buying more as soon as new ones are offered .	1
An amazing set for an affordable price ... Delicate images that stamp flawlessly for everyday nail art ... Thank you Pueen : )	1
check your records , I already reviewed this product . Check your records , please , this is getting a tad annoying . I did this already	1
The selection and case of Pueen plates are very nice . I like them better than Konad plate selection and at least Pueen gives you a storage case . Pueen images are large enough to cover your whole nail .	1
I am always looking for new plate sets , and this one is nice . It has a lot of different designs and most of them are nice .	1
I love these plates . they stamp smoothly and the designs are very unique . I highly recommend these for anyone collecting stamping plates !	1
Ordered these with a gift card , very satisfied . Great designs , although I have a hard time with the case , it 's not a deal breaker . I just do n't use it . All transfer well .	1
This was my first purchase of the Pueen plates at all , and I must say , I am SUPER IMPRESSED . The images are crisp , and etched a good depth . The thought process behind the design execution seems better than in other sets . ( no super thin lines that do n't transfer , etc ) The full nail bed plates seem to be a bit wider than the other sets I have purchased , which is helpful.I have tried out 3 different plates so far , and I have to say the quality is MUCH better than the Shany or Red Angel plates . Every transfer seems nice and clear . Can not say enough good things , want to buy the rest of everything they have put out ! ! And the white leatherette case was a super nice touch , trying to figure out if I have a use for it , since I keep my plates in a plate holder book .	1
While they are n't konad ( the best ! ) , they work pretty well and I still get lots of compliments . For the price you really ca n't beat them	1
Love these plates . Was a little disappointed when I got them I expected them to be bigger images , but I have to tell ya they work amazing . They have nice crisp lines and actually do fit my finger except for my middle finger and thumb so I use those as accent nails . Could n't be happier I chose these .	1
I got this set super fast with the prime shipping . The nail plates come in the gorgeous , compact leather case . These designs are definitely the best ones out of the major brands that I already have . Designs transfer very clean . Ordering the other set today .	1
The images are beautiful and original , and they stamp crisply and cleanly on the nail ! I have n't had any issues yet . I love both Pueen sets !	1
I really like this set . I was pleasantly surprised at the quality . They stamp well and I excited to add them to my collection . They came with a holder , but I removed them and placed them in my Bundle Monster plate case . The fit perfectly .	1
I really was excited to get these . I think these plates are cool and had lots of fun designs - even holiday specific ! It definitely depends on what nail polish you use with these . You can use any polish for the base , but to use on the plate , you need a more expensive polish . The 1.99 revlon did not work I would slide it across and try to get it on my stamp and nothing . Would n't even pick up or it was super patchy and did n't catch the whole design . I do n't think you need to get the & # 34 ; nail plate polish & # 34 ; but use a thicker richer polish if you want a nice print . I love American Apparel . Their polishes are like Paint . Work so well .	1
I am very satisfied with these plates . The images are unique and crisp . I would recommend these plates to everyone .	1
You could pay $ 5- $ 7 per plate if you want the Konad brand . Or you could buy this ! The edges are sharper than Konad plates so just be a little more careful.I hated the Bonus case . It 's just too clunky and ugly . I pulled mine apart and left each plate in the slip covers . However , I can see how people would like the storage case , it 's just not for me.If you have n't really looked at the designs on the stamp , you should . The variety is vast . The designs are also larger than a Konad plate . If you could n't cover your entire nail with Konad , you can now !	1
I have never had a Pueen plate before but , despite wanting one so bad I decided to wait . When I finally gathered enough courage to get it I had to wait , even further because only this set was available ( and not the one I originally wanted ) so once both of them were available ( 1-49 ) I jumped right one and I am happy that I did ! This set was far beyond what I expected and the case it came in was so convenient . I had heard that persons said in other brands that some plates might not stamp well so I decided to test every last image and it stamped excellently ! But , that still did n't stop me from slicing my finger open . I did n't know what it was that sharp but I am meticulous when it comes with cleaning the plates after use so that might have been my doing but , just a fair warning , be careful with the edges . Aside from that , I am pleasantly pleases with it and I use it every two weeks when I change my pedicure . The images are the biggest I have seen ( I have the first generation Winstonia as well as Pueen Plate 1-25 ) and I was so happy because I have medium-long nails and , when I tested them out , they fit better than I expected ( only tried Winstonia at the time ) . I highly recommend !	1
I am new to stamping and these are so much fun to use ! ! ! I really like them , and have found that the designs are , on the whole , the right size for my nails . Very nice and easy to store as they arrived in their own little leather-like pouch .	1
the size of the designs is wonderful whereas other companies are very small and do n't cover the whole nail . i love PUEEN and cant wait to buy more !	1
No need to double stamp my thumb ! Be sure to measure your nail beds before ordering . This will fit most . I do exhaustive research before ordering and these plates rate very high in overall usefulness . The patterns stamp clean and there are a variety of patterns ranging from light hearted to elegant . Stamping takes practice . Just scrape lighter on the images with more flooded areas to prevent scraping too much polish from the image . Enjoy .	1
First the caveat . My set arrived missing two plates ( 33 & 44 ) which after contacting customer service they were unable to replace . They did offer a generous discount due to the missing plates but it is a disappointment not to have the full set I ordered and few choices to replace them . So be aware this may happen to you as well and decide if its worth it to you.Now for the plates I do have . Though I have n't had a chance to play with very many of them yet what I have used has transferred well . My `` gold standard '' stamping polish is A-England Excalibur ( the original version ) when testing plates . For my stamper I use either a Born Pretty Store or the small end of the Salon Express duo if that helps any of you . The images with larger voids scrape better with a metal scraper otherwise an expired gift card works best for me . This is my second full set of stamping plates ( I started out buying singles till I was sure I could do it ) and I look forward to many fun manicures ahead .	1
These are great nail stamps . They work very well and I really like the designs . I would recommend these to others that like to do nail stamping nail art	1
Great plates , they stamp perfectly ! I will be using this set often . Lots of combinations to come up with for outstanding manis .	1
So far pueen seems to be my favorite brand of stamp plates . I have ordered tons of others from amazon , but these all work great ! and wonderful designs .	1
I was n't too sure about how these would be but there were a few images I had to have so I got this set and have been very happy , no issues with anything at all , a wide variety and they stamp well	1
This set is much better than the 1st Pueen set . I fell in love with the design of this set , it 's very elegant and just beautiful . They stamp really good and no more pesky half moon curve . They are all full nails which I love ! Overall I 'm very happy with it ! Well done !	1
These stamping plates from Pueen are nice . I love the designs on the image plates . When stamping the image transfers to the stamper nice and clean . Love the little booklet holder the plates fit into . Great for if you want to travel with your nail supplies .	1
So I have been doing this nail thing for 3 yrs now . I have just about every brand out there . So needless to say I have some good plates and So plates so badly done ( image wo n't stamp & /or sharp edges ) I also know about a good price to pay for plates . When I first saw these plates I thought the price was a little high . But it comes in a `` real '' case . Not a paper box stating it was a case but a real leather case with each plate is inside its own sheet protector . The image is so deeply edged in you can feel it completely with just your fingers . I also got the 1st set of Pueen plates ( 1-25 ) The plates are not as deeply edges but if you use a higher end or stamping polish you wont even know . I got one in a orange case ( my 2nd fav color ) and the other one is white . Outside of # 34 plate having a really deep and large scratch in it ( ca n't use 2 images ) the plates are sweet . The images are great . I 'm waiting for the Ankh ( an Egyptain Cross ) and the Triquetra ( a Celtic Trinity Knot ) to be the new images on next set of plates to come out . The price is a little high but you are paying for what you get . You get high quality plates and a protective case to hold your plates in . Good buy . There should be a frequent customer discount or lighten up on the price for the next sets .	1
happy with all the designs , theres a lot of them , good quality , fast delivery , i just loved them , i 'll buy more .	1
Awesome plates ! Came in a cute vinyl case with clear sachets for each of the plates ! Nice WIDE images which I love ! I have big/wide nail beds ( especially my thumbs ) Nice etching and amazing designs ! I stamp every 2 days so I 'm so giddy to use these babys ! ! It 's odd I have n't heard of this brand before and I own all the plates by all the different makers . Might be one of the best kept secretes ! Excited to upload some pictures soon !	1
As much is i absolutely love this product there is one con : not ideal for really long nails ( which i do n't have but plan on growing out my nails ) . Other than that there are so many designs on this plate for your heart 's desires . check out some youtube videos and you 'll see how amazing this product is.. also google some pictures . i also recommend nail striping tapes . pretty soon you 'll be making some awesome designs . highly recommend for average nail length and shorter .	1
I bought this set just for one specific image but they are all very nice and useful . There are a few cheesy images but it 's called & # 34 ; love elements & # 34 ; so that 's to be expected . All in all , a great buy and I would recommend it to any nail stamping lover .	1
Pueen really built on their strengths of their first set , and improved their techniques and style to deliver a great new set . The set is full of great , fun , and sophisticated designs , which are very well executed . In their older set , they tried to cram too much into too little space for a few designs , and the results were murky . With these , all of the designs are crisp while keeping some level of intricacy where needed . There is a nice wide range of styles in the set , and the full nail designs measure in at 1.5 x 2 cm , so will fit a lot of nails ( those of us with bigger thumbs often have to get creative , but it 's easier with these ) . All of my plates are etched perfectly - deep enough but not too deep , and many are now my most favorite and most-used plates.I 'm really looking forward to seeing what Pueen does next with stamping plates !	1
Yay ! ! ! I love the cute designs on these plates : ) And they are big enough to fit my larger middle fingers and thumb nails !	1
After using this set , I can say that the quality is wonderful and the variety of images is fresh and fun . I will definitely be watching for new sets from this maker !	1
Fast shipping , well packaged . I love this set . Very cute , durable , has the backing so no possible cuts . Stamps very clear cut deep enough for full detail even the tiniest detail works well . Would recommend . 5 stars and have used !	1
This plates are great , they are unique and the price is right and images get picked up well with any nail polish	1
Another of my nail plates that is very good , and the designs come out very clean and crisp . I 'm so glad I purchased them . I have short nails and small nail beds , and these work very well .	1
These plates came less than five days after I ordered them , talk about fast delivery ! I got a nice pink storage case which I 'm glad came as a bonus because I do n't have a case for any of my other plates yet . I tested all the plates , about 2-3 images per plate and they stamped clean and crisp . Even though these are `` Love '' themed , there is such a large variety of designs that I do n't feel like these are strictly designated for Valentine 's day or dates . I used one plate for my Independence Day manicure and plan on using several more for future nail designs . These fit my nails quite well , they are a smidgen wider than the Konad plates and that makes all the difference .	1
This was pleasing to the eyes for the fact that the presentation is so pretty . Different from the other plates I have collected which usually just come wrapped in plastic . The designs are very pretty on each and every plate . I was n't going to purchase any more plates but when I saw someone reviewing this collection on YouTube I caved in and got them . Did n't have any problems with my order and I checked all the plates .	1
Really nicely etched plates cute designs stamp well using a variety of polish and either type of stamperstorage case is cutesy but I dont use it	1
Another winning collection from Pueen . Plates are etched perfectly , I never have problems picking up the design even with a hard stamper .	1
I bought the first set of Pueen plates & was not too happy with them , and hesitated on buying these . I am very happy with these plates , they stamp much better than the other set & have beautiful designs . I would recommend these for anyone who loves to have pretty nails !	1
I love the brushes so far so good . Very soft and good size handles . I have just opened the pack and will have to wash them thoroughly as they have a very strong chemical smell to them .	1
These brushes work well . I 've been using them everyday ever since I got them . I regularly clean them with shampoo and it keeps the hairs in fine shape . So far no hairs are falling out and I like the bamboo handles , they feel solid and easy to handle . I like that they have a good range of sizes that make application a breeze . I do n't think I need anything more than this set of brushes so I 'll stick with these until something happens to them . Overall great quality for the price , would buy again .	1
wow what an amazing brush set ! they are super soft and of great quality , i just cant believe the price ! the handles are a very nice lacquered bamboo , solid , no plastic any were , and they were individually wrapped when they arrived . when i gave them their first wash , not one hair came out ! great as a first brush set and pros alike , no need to spend tons of money , this is all you need . i just wish they came with a better holder than just a pouch , all in all this is a fantastic set for an unbelievable price ( shipped fast too )	1
The brushes are very soft . The hair does n't come out of the brushes . The small brush is very small , I do n't like it , I would recomend these brushes .	1
My mom got me these for X-mas and to be honest I was't excited because of the brand . HOWEVER these are awesome . Super soft , little to no shedding and the blending and buffing brushes alone are worth the money . Very happy with these .	1
Very soft , very effective product . My only issue would be that cosmetic products seem to gather in the middle of the brush when it 's being used rather than dispersing through the whole brush .	1
These brushes are super soft and pretty . They work great , I have n't noticed and shedding so far , I 've had them for a few weeks now . I think that my only complaint is that a lost of the brushes , like the foundation/powder brush , and the one I use for contouring have super short handles . My fault though for not noticing that when I bought them . I do love them , and could see how the short handles would be great if you used these brushes for traveling .	1
I saw a YouTuber review this and I had to see it for my self the blending blush is like a Mac 217 and the foundation brushes are so smooth and amazing , this is the total package you get a blending brush which is hard to find in a set . A precision brush to smudge eyeshadow on your lower eye . And all the brushes are all for your face .	1
SO I ORDERED THESE ON SUNDAY AND RECIEVED THEM TUESDAY , THEY ARE REALLY SOFT AND JUST WHAT I WANTED.. THE BRUSHES LOOK AND FEEL LIKE GREAT QUALITY . IVE USED A COUPLE FROM AMAZON LIKE SHANY BRUSHES AND THE COASTAL SCENTS ONES.. I LOVE MY 22PCS COASTAL SCETS BRUSHES .. BUT I REALLY LIKE THESE TOO I USED THEM TODAY TO APPLY MY MAKEUP AND ALL THE BRUSHES WORK AND FEEL AMAZING , , DEF RECOMMEND THESE TO WHOEVER IS LOOKING FOR GOOD QUALITY INEXPENSIVE BRUSHES ! ( :	1
I choose a 5 they are trully beautifull , well made and strong , great colors too , excellent work ! ! ! ... they look expensive but they are not , great prices.I do recommend them to women who likes to pick their hair up or a bun , like me ! !	1
Very pretty , very sturdy ... .except for two of the gemstones having fallen out in the packaging . I will have to glue them back in . I thought I was purchasing a blue one because of the picture -- I did n't notice the description said purple . Had I realized , I would have only bought one for that price & not two . The picture has since been corrected on the main item page ( but is still showing blue for my order thumbnail . ) I have thin hair & the comb is a bit heavy , so I have to secure my hair well & wear it up high enough so it does n't dig into my neck with the long teeth ( though it 's not as bad as another more curved comb I purchased ) . The teeth are textured & gold tone.P.S . The seller was willing to work with me on the missing gemstones , but when I finally found the second one in the packaging on second look , I decided to just glue them back in myself .	1
I like it . I have thick kinky hair and it will stand in jusr fine with my hair . it is very shinney and pretty however I was hoping that it was the blue and green color as pictured but I received a purple one instead . Foe that reason , Im taking off one star .	1
This hair piece is BEAUTIFUL ! It is very , very sturdy , and it works GREAT ! I got this one and the blue kind , and both are gorgeous ! !	1
Ca n't recall if I received I got several I ordered all beautiful priced so well free shipping cheap looking is n't this . Value beauty little heavier than plastic 3 to 4 inches or read instruction.Correction it arrived today BEAUTIFUL ! ! ! It 's exactly as stated Vermeil over 3 inches stays put in the hair ! ! As I type I 'm wearing well priced although I think you might find that it looks more than priced ( 4.50 ) for sure ! ! I give it an 10 score 5 stars . Age teen n above or 20 n above . Wearing to high school could be an over kill its nice looking leaning to expensive compared what you pay . Enjoy	1
I love this comb . It 's very beautiful , very very well made and mom 's been trying to still it so I sleep with it . Okay just kidding about sleeping with is but it 's Adorable . May take a while to get to you but you will be pleasantly surprised .	1
I 'm not sure whose fault it is ... But most likely mine because I do n't ever read the description / instructions . I received this piece in purple instead of blue ( the color I thought I had ordered ) I had ordered it blue cause it matched the color of my work uniform.The description does say purple . ( I read it after I received it ) It is a beautiful hair accessory . Now I juts have to find something purple to wear it with.Also very fast shipping !	1
Incredible price and the photos online do n't do this hair clip justice . It is stunning and will add glamour to a simple hair bun or ponytail !	1
This is a great all metal comb that is a lovely accent for a bun or to sweep on side back . It holds heavy thick hair .	1
Easy to use , a little bit heavy for my thin hair but in thick hair is ok. Great thing to buy .	1
This hair clip was so pretty that I recently ordered it in another color as well . Would recommend this product !	1
It takes forever for these to arrive but they are worth the wait ! I have tons of hair with a life separate from mine ! Oyang prodictswork very well with thick silky hair !	1
I really like this hair clip , it is heavy and high quality and comes as described . Made out of brass and is shipped pretty quickly considering it 's coming from China .	1
Not much to say about this . The picture pretty much tells it all . A very lovely hair comb that is quite large and heavy .	1
This is very pretty in person it looks even better , thinking of ordering more . Would definitely recommend it to others , it takes longer than normal orders as comes across the ocean , but it still arrived for me ahead of the amazon anticipated date .	1
love the way it looks on my hair specially when I pick it up..strong and well made at a great price.I highly recommended for long hair on a bun or as a gift ! !	1
i bought five for my bridesmaid 's they loved them . warning they are bigger than you think but overall these are gorgeous and a affordable price !	1
I love this hair pin . I have a lot of hair and it actually picks all of my hair and stays in for a while .	1
I love this hairpin . It is very sturdy and beautiful it adds a lot of style to a simple hairdo . It takes a while to get to you , but anything you want I life is worth waiting on .	1
l though the first hairpin I received was defected , I must admit that this is a beautiful piece . I contacted the seller & explained my situation . They gave me the option to refund me the money or send me a new one . I chosed to get another one.I 'm so glad I did . It 's beautiful , just a great hairpin . A must have . I get alot of complements on it . Color is exactly as shown on the picture . I feel that it looks way better in person . For less than 3 dollars its worth way more than that . Do n't quite remember how long it took the first time , but the second time was 2 weeks shipping .	1
Quality ingredients that are anti inflammatory , moisturizing , antioxidant , and healing.This eye cream is light and quickly absorbed , not oily . It feels very soft and does not bother my eyes as may eye creams do . A little goes a long way , 2 months supply in this bottle . I have been using it twice a day , at night before I go to bed and in the morning under my make up . I am happy with this product . It helps remove lines and the dark circles . I especially like the how it works to diminish my puffiness . Good customer service and really fast shipping .	1
Not bad product but I am finding that most of these products for the eyes don & # 34 ; t do as they say . Alot of money spent with little results .	1
Really like this eye gel . Cooling with a brightening and tightening effect . I have noticed some line improvement so far . I will update with more results later . Soo many other eye products have caused swelling . This one is a winner !	1
I absolutely love the creaming feel of this product . It 's lightweight yet very effective . I will pick up extras for my gym bag and for my aunt who has dark circles under her eyes .	1
My wife love a lot of lifting cream.She 's so relieved to found an aging cream that actually works. & # 34 ; I am very glad. & # 34 ; She has been using THAT Eye Cream for 2 months now and can clearly see the progress.What a great effect it has on her skin.She 's started to use THAT Eye Cream a day for a few weeks now , I noticed significant improvement in her face around the eyes.She has used different expensive brands of skin care creams ( La Prairie , La Mer , Cle du Peau ) before this with no visible improvement.It was super easy to order the cream online and got it in 2 days.I am recommending it to everybody .	1
It feels pretty diluted but does n't mean it is not good . Because of viscosity one small drop is enough for both eyes . So far I have seen no problems at all . Too early to say any antiaging effects . after all decent product . Great pump .	1
I really like the feel of this gel on my skin . I have been using it for a few days now and feel that it is working .	1
My skin around my eyes looks and feels great ! I have used it for about a month and can definitely notice a difference ! Smells great and does n't leave an oily residue !	1
THAT Eye Cream All-in-One Eye Gel with Vitamin C is as exciting as the name ! I was very hopeful when searching for an anti aging eye cream serum when I came across this product . I am very happy with my purchase and I have already noticed significant improvement with my puffy eyes and dark circles . Highly recommend !	1
I got this because I have dark circles under my eyes . I have been using this for about a week , and the darkness under my eyes is getting lighter . It is not completely gone but I will continue to use it . Thank you very much . I do not look as tired as I used to .	1
I love , love , love these lashed . They are the perfect length and fullness . No one ever believes that they are fake .	1
if you 're wanting the natural but long look with falsies ... these are the way to go . i hated the straight blunt cut lashes that you find most places ... .it just shouts & # 34 ; yeah these are fake & # 34 ; . these are beautiful and look much more natural then any other style ive worn . will be purchasing again	1
my favorite lashes ... they look natural and are very easy to apply ... with proper care they can last you 8-10 wears each ... Beautifull lashes	1
Really fun , flirty , and wispy looking lashes . These lashes are feminine and dramatic ; they add some volume and length , but nothing overboard . If you 're looking for lashes that will give your eyes a more `` open '' and flirty appearance , you will love these lashes.I love that these Demi Wispies have a clear band . This means the strip lash is much more flexible and can accommodate any eye shape with more ease . The band also makes the lashes more versatile as they can even be worn without any eyeliner . The band also makes these lashes feel very lightweight and comfortable compared to their strip-lash counterparts on the market.Considering the price of a single pair of these lashes , I will continue to repurchase the multipacks .	1
Very Natural eyelashes , blends well with real lashes . Perfect length for all kinds of makeup , you can go natural with it , but also sexy wild . Depends on how you apply your eyeshadow . Good buy !	1
Im obsessed with these lashes and once again the seller did not disappoint . I will continue to be a faithful customer recommend them to all my friends . These lashes are extremely natural looking and I am constantly getting compliments .	1
Really like the Sublime Beauty products , including this one . I 've been using the night cream , day cream and not the serum so hopefully will see great results in another month or so . I do love the way they make my skin feel .	1
I 've been using it for 2 weeks now and have already seen some good things . Usually at this time of year I have a drab pallor to my skin without my tan . Now with the serum and cream , I notice a cleaner , glowing skin and look forward to all the good results promised by using it longer . Ca n't say enough about Sublime Beauty cusomer service too .	1
I bought this retinol serum because I needed something to help heal the dry damaged skin on my face . I have a swimming pool and lay out and swim at least an hour on every sunny day . Over time , my skin has become dry and sun damaged . This product has really helped to improve the skin around my eyes . At first , I used it only 3 times a week , but now I am using it every day . I love how much better my eyes look . I feel that this retinol serum has been gentle on my skin , too . This product is exactly what I needed to improve my damaged skin problem . I am so pleased with this purchase .	1
Have n't used this product enough to know results . So far the cream feels good on ones face , Use it at night	1
I was given a couple of sample pots and I really love this serum . My skin feels so soft and smooth and definitely has a lovely glow now . My little crows feet around my eyes look fainter too . Some retinol creams I 've tried have made my skin feel like it was burning after I applied it but this one did n't irritate my skin at all . I will most definitely be a regular customer of Sublime from now on .	1
Skin products with retinol are the best you can get for fighting fine lines and wrinkling . But they are more expensive or need a prescription . This serum is economical but is probably equal I 'm quality as far as I can tell on my skin to Oil of a Olay treatment products which are similarly priced . A matter of preference .	1
I had tried some anti-wrinkle serum a few months ago from another company and it worked well for my face . I thought i 'd try this retinol serum from Sublime Beauty to see how they compare.The serum bottle was inside a very cute mesh bag , i squeeze about a blueberry sized amount and massage it in to the back of each hand.A blueberry sized amount is also sufficient to cover my forearms.It absorbs well , not greasy , not sticky.My friend and her kids even joined in and we all tried it out on our hands , faces and arms.If you are highly sensitive to fragrances and scents , i would recommend you use this for your hands and arms and trySublime Beauty 's other product , perhaps the one with hyaluronic acid for your face instead if you find the scent in this serum to be too strong for for face .	1
The Retinol serum is very light and does n't make my skin dry out and peel as a lot of other Retinol products do . It seems to have helped with my wrinkles and slightly lightened my dark spots . The only problem I have is with the pump on the bottle . It 's not very smooth and pumps out a lot more than I need .	1
i received a few samples of Sublime Beauty 's Retinol Serum to try and really was amazed at the results . i 'm 43 , Asian and have n't taken very good care of my skin when i was younger . i have a lot of sun spots and uneven skin due to sun exposure but ever since using the Retiniol Serum , my skin has improved dramatically . i 'm impressed with how gentle the product is on the skin while still doing its job . even with a lot of previous skin damage , this product really helped me turn it around and give me a more glowing and younger looking skin . i 'm looking forward to trying out their other products as well !	1
So I 'm not sure about the scarring yet but my pores have gone down tremendously . When I washed my face before using this , I used to feel a lot of bumps ( I think they were black heads ) . All those have disappeared . My face does get red after I used this but as suggested , I moisturize with avocado oil , vitamin e oil or tea tree oil ( and eventually cocoa butter oil ) . After that I followed up with aloe vera gel and african shea butter . It 's quite a bit of layers of stuff but those products are great and do n't cause break outs due to their organic nature . I used to use it nightly but now I do n't have a need for it anymore . I 'll probably keep doing it everyone week at least twice . I 'm very happy that I found this product . My face is smoother and tighter and soon it will hopefully be scarless as well .	1
I 've been using the Derma Roller over the past two/three weeks and have enjoyed my results so far . My dermatologist had recommended the professional treatment which is why I first looked on Amazon because those will get really expensive really quickly . This device does hurt a bit while using it , I guess it 's more uncomfortable rather than pain . After your face will be red and will need time to calm down , I usually put a soothing lotion on it or one of my various acne medications so it can get deep down into my pores . I noticed immediately after one use how soft my skin felt . I 've used it a handful of times since and each time am impressed with how my skin feel after the fact . I do not expect it to immediately get rid of my acne scars , but I have noticed that they 've diminished a bit and I look forward to continuing to use this product .	1
It works	1
It hurts alot but i saw results fast . Remember to clean this with alcohol before and after each use becuase it goes in your skin .	1
Great product , I use this on my face when I use other creams an it helps for sure . Love it .	1
I had never tried a derma roller , but heard and read many good things about how well they work on wrinkles , I decided to give it a try . I purchased both , a 1.0 and a .5 , since I was unsure which would work best on my face , ( and if the 1.0 was too much for the skin on my face ) . I also decided I could use this 1.0 on other areas of my body ( to work on cellulite ! ) . I 'm glad I did . This 1.0 is a little painful on my face , so for now , I 'm using it on my body . Maybe after using the .5 on my face for a while , I 'll build up a tolerance and will need/want to start using this one on my face too . It came very securely packaged and in addition to the storage/travel case it fits into , it was sealed in sterile packaging ( the same way that surgical tools are sealed ) . I followed the instructions and felt very safe using this product .	1
This product is simply AMAZING ! ! ! ! ! it tones your skin and allows your product ( s ) to absorb and penetrate deeply into the skin . I have been using this product for 2 weeks and my skin is flawless . The dark pigmentation spots are 98 % gone , which normally takes over 3 months to disappear . Also the customer service is simply exceptional ! ! ! ! ! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT ! ! ! !	1
I have to admit , I had no idea what this was until I saw it on the Amazon 's list of bestsellers . I decided to buy it after seeing rave reviews along with lots of youtube videos about the product . I 've used it ~2x/week for a month now and my skin definitely feels softer . After the very first time I used it , my face felt really tingly and kind of raw the next day , like I got a sunburn . With each subsequent use , I can hardly feel it anymore even when I press a little harder . I always clean it with EtOH pads or spray-on 70 % EtOH before using it . A plus on the roller is that it comes in a small plastic case , so it 's not like you just leave it on the shelf , which might get unsanitary . After using the roller , I put a thin lotion ( essence ) - some people suggest essential oils or hyaluronic acid - you can do whatever regimen you 're used to and I do think the skin soaks it up better . My skin is really soft in the morning after doing this.The whole purpose of the dermarollers is to cause controlled amounts of 'damage ' to the skin to induce collagen production and healing without having any visible scars/damage . I do n't think it 's a baseless gimmick , so if you 're curious , like I was , I 'd give it a try .	1
I have only been using this about 2 weeks but I 'm excited to see results , which usually take about 3 months or so to really be noticeable . I love the concept of creating micro wounds in the skin ( no bleeding involved ) in order to entice the body into creating more collagen in that area as part of the natural healing process . I soak mine in 70 % rubbing alcohol for about 5 minutes before I use it and again after to keep it super clean .	1
My wife started noticing small differences right away . She had one little & # 34 ; trouble & # 34 ; spot and this has helped with the Stretch marks from having kids . It is a little scary to use at first but once you get the hang of it things go smoothly .	1
I use it with a smaller one.. Alternating them.. Every 20 days I do a treatment.. The larger one does not hurt as badly.. The smaller one is better around the nose area.. It hurts though.. Do n't think otherwise.. I even used a numbing cream.. It hurts but I love it anyway..	1
I like this ( I think ) ... or am I just vane and thinking & # 34 ; I look younger & # 34 ; ... LOL I am a fanatic with daily cleansing , moisturizing , sun screen , etc . And I am at the age of fine lines ... so can I say that this is helping ( I 'm not sure ) but I think it might be . I only use it a couple of times a week . I make sure to & # 34 ; soak & # 34 ; it with alcohol prior to using , I also alcohol my face slightly before and after each use . And definitely use a hydrating moisturizing lotion after using it . I use it at night . If you do n't use a good hydrating moisturizer you skin will feel stingy ... so be sure to have a good moisturizer on hand before using this . And I have received compliments on my complexion ... I am just not sure if it is because of this ... or all the hydrating natural products I use on my face daily. ? . ?	1
This is the best Derma Roller you can find on the market . I tried another Derma R. before but this one I can say is the best . Smooth ( unless u wan na hurt yourself ) I use it with `` Triple Action Vitamin C Serum + Hyaluronic Acid '' .Only after 1 day of use I already lovemy face . They also give you email instruction of how to use it and everything you want to know just ask and they will provide you withthe most satisfying answers.By the way , I also started to use it for my stretch marks also . I will update after a week or two with more news . SGF Limited you rock ! ! ! ! I would definitely use their products in the future ! UPDATE : Feb/22/14 My sister visited me today ( because of work and distance we see each other like once every month ) . All I she can say was WOWW ... .she told me that my face really look different , more radiant , clear and that I started to have a beautiful face again . You have to be consistent on using the Derma Roller in order to see some progress . 5 more stars !	1
I have used this derma roller for a few weeks now and really like it . Its been good with my sensitive skin . I think it takes 2-3 months to really know if a product works , so looking forward to the effects . Would definetly recommend the product . Thanks !	1
First it really does n't hurt , it is recommended to be used for ten minutes daily at night . It can be used vigorously or according to your comfort level , most importantly you should feel some kind of sting afterward then put on your anti-aging cream and your moisturizer . This facial gadget is a keeper . It really does aid in making the skin tight and flawless ; of course you need to use it for two to three weeks to see the effect . I noticed a difference in my skin after the third day of using it . I love this roller and it has become a must in my skin care regiment . I highly recommend this product for those of you that want real results . Great invention !	1
I 'm impressed by its fast renewing effect on my face . I started using two days ago after my skin is healed from acid peeling . It reduced scars on my face and evened skin tone . It works fast but you might need a little bit patience to roll it on your face .	1
So I was really chicken about using this but it really is no big deal . I think it is important to have a soothing serum/gel/cream to follow the treatment . I make sure my face is clean and I use alcohol to clean the roller . I use it when I have a few minutes and it has reduced my pore size and makes my other skin care products absorb nicely . I 'm not into radical skin treatments and this is gentle and can be advanced at my pace.UPDATESo I have been using the derma roller on a regular basis and I must say I really love the product . I couple it with a Vit C serum ( Xfacio ) and see a containing positive difference in my skin . I have looked over other reviews and I must say if you do n't go nuts it is not painful at all . Just make sure you are cleaning it properly and using it on clean skin . It is staying as part of my routine for sure .	1
Not a lot to say . Have to wait months to see if it actually works but it feels good . Sounds weird but it does .	1
This needle roller is a little narrower than most , which makes it easier to trace around eyes and crow 's feet . It has a feeling of a more finely made implement than others . it has a nice ergonomic handle and very smooth needles that do not scratch	1
it does help some scars . i just need to give it some more time.i think it will take a few months to totally get rid of my scars .	1
love this product ! ! it helps , face feels better after using it ! Love derma roller , happy with it ! worth it !	1
I was used it the first time on my face and I can see the different in the morning . The second day I used it on my body I am not sure if it work but only one time of both . But I love it anyway . I am going to buy one more for my mom .	1
OK , so this is the very first derma roller I have ever used . I never had any facials or anything done to my face . Started to notice small fine lines under the eye and a few hormonal pimples here and there that bugged me from time to time . I have been using this roller for 4 days now and I can honestly see the difference in my skin complexion and texture . I have to be honest , it does pinch around when you roll it on your skin , so please please be careful and do n't press the roller to hard on the skin . I wash my face first , use the roller then apply my moisturizer which in my case is pure virgin coconut oil . The first time I used the roller was right before my sleep and my face itched all night ! I could not fall asleep and I was terrified to wake up in the morning with red spots allover the face . I am not sure if the itchiness was from the first use or I rolled it more than I was supposed to on the areas . After the third time it did not itch . Also make sure you clean the roller with rubbing alcohol after each use to prevent infections and bacteria .	1
I 've used dermal rollers before , and generally stick to the cheapest versions since I replace them after 3 months use ( I 'm a slight bacteria-phobe , even after dousing these with alcohol after every use ) . The Dermal Roller SGF is by far my favorite version ! No sticking or pulling and it 's super comfortable to reposition ( and the 1.0mm length really is n't painful for me ) . Love love love this thing ! Dermal rollers in general : I was skeptical that puncturing my face repeatedly with needles would lead to noticeable improvements , but 2+ years of use has made me a firm believer . Fantastic results in clarity and texture ! I generally try to roll 2x a week , and that seems to be enough to maintain impressive results . I occasionally fall out of habit , but as soon as I hop back on , am continually amazed to look as if I 've spent a long weekend receiving ridiculously expensive facials at a BevHills spa .	1
I really like this roller . It really helped my skin . I will continue to use and will purchase again when necessary .	1
I am a 52 year old female with sensitive skin . I had this item in my shopping cart for about a month before I actually purchased it . Once I got it delivered , I started using it . I was def light handed at first and I had no reactions at all . I am not one to follow rules , and I found that the way they suggested using it was taking too long , so I developed my own little system . I have been using retin A right after and 2 days later , my skin is really peeling , so it absolutely helps any product penetrate better . I am also using Watts Beauty Moisturizing Hyaluronic Acid / Vitamin C / L Serum . I think it 's too soon to tell if there is any transformation , so I will check back .	1
I had a breakout after I started taking oral pills . I started using this roller right after my pimples dried out . ( Actually , some of them were still active when I started so I just avoided such areas . ) I 'm a very busy graduate student so I 'm not religious with my routine . I 'm glad how the marks have visibly faded within 2 weeks . I remember about 6 years ago , I had to pay my dermatologist for around $ 300 to have derma roller sessions ! It still pisses me off when I remember it ! I saw some reviews complaining about how the roller did not address their issue on uneven surfaces caused by acne . In order to address that kind of problem , you need to restore skin cells in those areas . This is not the product for that ( obviously ) . You should get some kind of a vitamin ( oral or topical ) to stimulate new skin cells that will even out the surface . Also , it 's good to keep in mind that the fresher the scars , the faster you can get rid of them.I also use vitamin E serum from the usual vitamin capsules . It helps stimulate healing . Honey will do the same , too . Just try it in a certain area once to check if your skin will like it . Some sensitive skin might react differently.Cheers to a more beautiful and confident us !	1
I have used this product twice now . ( and will continue to use ) I am seeing marked reduction in marionette lines and other wrinkles on face . Also the general tone of my complexion has changed to something I recognized as my & # 34 ; youthful & # 34 ; complexion . Note : I am over 60 years ) My complexion is lighter ( it was pretty light to begin with , now it is almost porcelain and the texture is incredibly smooth . I am so thankful I followed this recommendation and purchased this product based on reviews by others as I was checking out reviews on moisturizing cr & egrave ; mes at Amazon . Also , it is up to the user to decide how much pressure to apply to your rolling . Start with gentle rolling and increase , if desired , and always sterilize device by using 70 % ( or better ) iso . alcohol or hydrogen peroxide and clean your face both before and after per the enclosed directions . This device is without doubt the best money I have ever spent for skin care and enhancement . If you are afraid of needles or using them then maybe this device is not for you , but just be gentle at first and you will find the perfect pressure to apply to get the maximum benefits .	1
I was skeptical but for the price and return policy I had nothing to loose . I 'm 36 and have a good skin but first lines started to show : one between eyebrows and 2 nasolabial folds . Especially on 1 side the line is more visible , I could see how gravitation works over years ; ) I used the roller 4 times , once a week for last month . It does hurt in a way , exactly like I was expecting , like tiny needles on the skin . But I thought it will be worse . I do n't have sensitive skin and tried bunch of acids , like lactic and glycolic 65 % and TCA ( that burns a layer of a skin ) . Acids helped to get rid of my melasma ( after I went to the beach without spf taking birth control , I came back and my face was all in dark spots like someone spilled a paint , disaster ! ) . It took long months to have a 99 % spot free face.My problems now are these lines I mentioned and 2 darker spots on my cheekbones right where sun hits the face . So far I can not see the spots disappear and I use retinol , vit C , I think I either have to burn these two with TCA or use lactic acid once a week or more just on the spots.But I 'm shocked how my lines got smoother . I sent some pictures to my sister 2 months ago how I did my hair and 8 weeks later again ( yesterday ) and she commented on the lines that they are barely visible . I thought they were but sometimes you WANT something to disappear ; ) Anyway she started to say something about those laugh lines and I interrupted her saying , yeah yeah I know I got them and she said : No ! they actually way more less noticeable ! It almost looks like I got botox which I never had it done.So for sure I will continue to use the roller . I think once a week is enough . I research online and for 1 mm roller it is recommended to use it only 1 time a month ( so collagen has time to start working to rebuild the tissue , smaller rollers can be used more often ) . Also I roll quite hard to give a skin a kick and it looks like it works.When I used it first time my face for red for 2-3 days , like a sunburn and it sting a bit when I applied creams and make up the next day . I used a good retinol product and skin slightly pilled but nothing terrible . I think I had a less than 2 week break and I felt like I was ready to do it again . After each time skin is less red . Only one time I rolled harder in between my eyebrows and I had my skin bleeding but it went after I wiped it with a witch hazel pads from Trader Joe's.I ca n't believe I did n't know about this product earlier , I 'm such a skincare and make up junkie.Last note is about seller , they send emails to make sure you are happy and know how to use the roller but they recommend to use it daily , there is no way I can use it next day after skin is so red and sensitive . Unless you roll very delicately and it does n't hurt . But what 's the point ? Also when I asked the question they paste this huge email which is not my answer and when I ask again they said `` the answer was in the email '' , geez just answer the first time instead sending bunch of info I do n't need so obviously I do n't read , you know customize , that makes the customer happy . When I ask again then they answer in one sentence , without standard politeness . I 'm not a queen obviously but that makes me want to do business somewhere else in a future .	1
I have heard that using this will improve the condition of the skin . Looking forward finding out if this happens	1
i got mine in the mail rather quickly and i have been using it for a little over a week now and the clarity and hyperpigmentation in my skin is already showing improvement , i was a little skeptical at first but i use it nightly and am very happy with the results so far . Fast shipping	1
I 've been using this roller ones a month and I am happy with the results . I 'm not going to lie , the first time was quite painful , but I am a chicken when it comes to pain . I follow the treatment with vitamin c serum , and then collagen cream . Be brave ladies .	1
I have started using this with the vitamin c serum and then a retinol cream I also purchased on amazon . I am really starting to see some results ! Im Not sure if its more this or the other items or maybe all 3 together are whats working.I was a little scared to try this after reading some reviews talking about how painful it is and the need for a numbing cream . I did not find that to be the case . yes , you do feel the little needles but not what I would describe as painful . Maybe I just have a high pain tolerance.The results im seing are after only 3 times in the last 2 weeks . I do It at nIght before bed and I follow it with the vitamin c serum and after that dries I use the retinol cream . My skin looks brighter and more even . Your face will turn red like a mild sunburn right after but will be back to normal by morning . Im excited to see what it will do after a few months of use !	1
I have been using another brand of derma roller and recently broke it . So I saw this one and thought I would try it . It 's the same needle size as my other one but is so much gentler on my face . I use it on the upper lip , crow 's feet and then over my cheeks . It really gives my face a nice glow and I definitely think I look a lot healthier . The crow 's feet around my eyes are very much less visible . The upper lip is improving but needs more work.I am also using it on a couple of marks on my legs . I will update this review when I have been using it for longer . All in all , a great product , nice quality and very easy to use .	1
You can `` reset '' your hair - if by `` resetting '' you mean make it smell like you overdosed on cologne , liberally coated your hair with hairspray , put a hat on , slept in your car for a few hours , took the hat off , and walked for a mile in a slight drizzle . It does n't look or feel refreshed , nothing is `` reset '' - the only real redeeming value of this stuff is that after about 30 minutes , the smell of it dissipates enough so that you do n't smell it again until your hair gets wet again.Personally , I 'd rather use nothing than use this . If something ( say ... icy cold water ) was available , it 'd be a no brainer to use it . Yes , I understand that this is for `` no water '' hair cleaning . The problem is : this product does n't help at all , and in fact makes the perceived problem even worse.Do n't buy this junk .	-1
This product is a joke ! It leaves your hair sticky and gummy . I would not recommend it . On the other hand , I have tried the dry powder shampoos , and they work great . This one is a Big disappointment .	-1
I used this on myself even though this is marketed for men . I like the idea as I ca n't wash my hair everyday because of getting dry scalp . I used this last night when i knew i would be off the next day incase this turned out horrible . I have long hair so i had to use 4 pumps instead of the 2 recommened to cover all of my hair . My hair looks more oily after using this product . The scent is wonderful and long lasting but i really looked like i needed to wash my hair after using this product .	-1
This morning I planned a trip to the gym before my morning shower , so I tried some of this dry shampoo to look a little more human as I stumbled to the machines . The product is easy to use , with a simple pump that puts out enough foam to rub in your hair , and it smells really good ( cool and fresh , the kind of smell you 'd hope for from the particular blue color on the bottle ) . I definitely did n't look like I 'd showered , though . For the first few minutes , my hair looked wet and greasy , then it just kind of looked greasy . Technically , I suspect that it was cleaner than when I had started , but I doubt that anyone who noticed me thought , `` Man , that guy probably took a shower today ! '' I like the idea of keeping this with your camping supplies for long trips when you wo n't take a real shower for a few days , but I had hoped that this would be my solution for days when I oversleep and have to rush to work , and it 's not at that level .	-1
I had n't washed my hair for 2 days and tried this . I did what the directions said , IE put the foam in my hand and rub it all over my hair . After about 5 minutes , my hair still looked greasy and like I had n't done anything to it . It did smell good , but other than that , this product is pretty well useless for what it claims .	-1
makes your hair feel dragged down and sticky . the smell is really awful too . Seriously just take a shower save yourself the hassle . this is like putting sticky mouse in your hair	-1
I got this shampoo to try after my workouts in the morning . My hair is on the dry side , so I do n't want to wash it every day and I thought this was a good alternative.The directions say to use 1-2 pumps , I used 2 the 1st time and it was probably too much for my short hair . It smells really good , not too manly and the smell stayed in my hair most of the day . The problem is that this claims to not give a greasy look , but I really thought it did . It felt like a mousse and hardened in my hair , giving it an overly hairsprayed look . My hair smelled cleaner , yes , but it did not look or feel any cleaner . Disappointing product .	-1
Your choice - sticky and gummy or dirty ? The Axe Waterless Dry Shampoo left my son 's hair sticky and gummy . He immediately went to take another shower and wash it out . It does have a nice fragrance and I will be trying this on an elderly gentleman this weekend who is in a nursing home . I will update my review when I have more to compare it to .	-1
My husband thought it was a mousse ... it took me forever to convince him it was n't , especially since it did n't work as advertised . My husband has very long , thick wavy hair , and washing his hair is not something he can do quickly . Some days he only has time for a quick shower , so I thought he could use this product on those days , but when he tried it , neither one of us could tell any difference.To be honest , I have been looking for a waterless shampoo for our travel needs ( ex : transatlantic flights that take forever ) , and I have yet to find one that did something more than act as a fancy mousse .	-1
I have to say my hair is salt and pepper , so when I have used baby powder on oily looking spots and then brush my hair out it looks fine and there is no oily residue.When I tried this , first there was a smell that reminded me of the vitalis my father used to use and that was not a particularly good smell and very strong . This pumps out as foam and it left my hair wet . It says it is ready for styling , but unless you style your hair wet or with some mousse , it 's not going to be ready until it dries . When it does dry it looked like stuck together oily clumps , even after I combed ... so out came the baby powder , sprinkle and then brush out and fluff and I had an emergency solution for some oily looking hair .	-1
I have enjoyed the other recent Axe products very much , even though I am a female . They hold my hair well and have a toned down Axe scent that fades quickly.This one is different . It adds powder to my hair , little flakes that create `` dirt '' in my newly washed hair and actually make it look like it needs washing again.I think for a male with a certain hair style , one that hangs down in front of his face a bit , or needs separation , this would work well.However , I do n't like any type of flakey powder flying around my head , having asthma . It creates dust not only in my hair but in the air in my house , something I fight to keep under control.I can imagine a guy with newly washed hair wanting to acheive a nonchalant , messy look with good separation . For this type of style this would be great . It does indeed separate and add a bit of lift if you get this down at the roots . As for me , I am not the target audience . I like my hair to look fresh , clean and shiney , and this makes me want to wash it again.edit : I am downgrading my review and removing stars . This stuff is not good for you . It is a fine , sticky powder that easily becomes airborn and floats around your head like a cloud of fine particles . And a warning : do not use if you have asthma or other breathing problems . This is such a fine dust and has a tendency to go all over the place , that if you inhale it and you probably will , you could provoke an asthma attack that is serious . I ca n't use this and feel it is a health hazard .	-1
I thought this product was going to be pretty cool , but when I first opened it , puffs of flaky , sticky dust shot right into my face . My nose burned for an hour ! But , me always being the optimist that I am , I thought that maybe the puff in the face was just from being tossed around during shipping . The biggest mistake was actually putting the product in my hair . My hair was so dry , I thought it was going to fall off ! This product is horrible , please do n't waste time on this .	-1
Definitely different but not valuable . It leaves hair tacky -- yuck . You will need to apply directly to the hair since trying to shake the `` powder '' into your hand for application is disastrous and wasteful . There are too many other styling products on the market to waste your time or money on this one .	-1
First thing I noticed when I opened the box was how the dust is everywhere inside the packaging . And upon opening the actual container it will float everywhere . So yeah , it 's messy alright . But not the way I 'd hoped.I tried this several times before and after a hair cut . Before , it simply made my hair look like I 'd not put any product in it but it was stiff as can be . It was n't defined and looked terrible . I thought it would work better with short hair but I was wrong . Still held stiff , but it did n't look good and it did n't hold how I wanted it ( where I wanted it ) .I 'm not impressed with the product and using it ( opening it ) is an ordeal with the dust floating all over the place . Not a fan and do n't recommend it .	-1
This product is aimed for men but I have somewhat short-hair and the product I used to use to get the 'messy look ' has been discontinued , so I thought I would try this . It is meant to be used on dry hair at the roots , which gave me hair volume but not a messy look . Even if rubbing it into the scalp messes up your hair , it is n't going to hold . I had a guy I know try it and he said the same thing.So this is something I could use when I need to add a little volume to my hair , but I will keep looking for a product that gives me that 'messy look ' .	-1
I typically use forming cream to style my hair because my hair is so straight and thick that I have to put SOMETHING in it . I let it go dry and added this dust . No good.First of all , this `` dust '' is super bizarre stuff that is nearly impossible to shake out of the container . It 's lighter than air and floats around the bathroom as you trying to get it into your hair . Secondly , it 's like cement . Once it 's in , you ca n't even run your fingers through your hair without feeling like someone smeared rubber cement on your head . Thirdly , it goes in dry and makes your hair look dusty and dirty , like you just got done rolling around in sawdust.Very strange , very odd . Not recommended at all .	-1
this is a type of hair product i 've never seen before- nothing even similar . granted , i 'm not a guy , and maybe there are other Axe products like this . I got a sample of this , thinking it might work as a texturizer for my occasionally flat hair ( thick and heavy hair that gets weighed down ) , since it 's billed as Gravity Defying Dust . i thought it might be similar to a baby powder consistency-type texturizer , like the many `` dry '' hair products on the market i 've used before . it is not.when i received the tube , it was extremely light , and i thought it was empty . I twisted open the top ( like a baby powder dispenser with holes ) shook it a bunch of times in my hand , and saw that i had an extremely fine and nearly see-through ... dust in my palm , that was more like invisible fluff than powder . i put some in my clean hair , and it left a slightly filmy/sticky textured feeling in random parts of my hair , but it was hard to evenly spread , and there was more on my hand than on my hair after application . you ca n't easily see the fluff unless you put piles of it in your hand , and it mildly texturizes your hair ( and hands ) .there are warnings on the product not to get it in your eyes . i would n't normally be putting hair products in my eye , so that made sense , except that this product was so light and dusty , there is a far greater chance of it getting in your eye ... or your lungs , etc ... the name of the product does n't describe what it does to your hair as much as what it looks and feels like right out of the tube . the messy look is you trying to put this stuff evenly in your hair , and trying so hard you eventually just get a lot of static going on.i do n't really recommend this , although maybe it would work for someone with much finer hair.update : this product took a week to wash out of my hair completely . if you like the texture , you 'll have it a long time ! if you do n't , ugg .	-1
Axe Gravity Defying Dust brought back memories of the dry shampoo spray Pssssst . It is a gritty , oil absorbing ( shine killing ) powder that adheres to your hair to create a dull , messy head of hair . If I were in middle school aiming for a grunge look this product would be perfect but the rest of us can skip it . I have added product images so you can see how small this item is . You are getting 0.035oz . It is smaller than most sample sized products and very pricey .	-1
I 've never seen anything exactly like this product . It 's a small shaker that shakes a powder out . You apply the powder straight to your roots . The texture of the product immediately changes as you rub it through your hair and becomes sticky feeling . I really did n't like the feel of it on my hair or my hands.When I was done applying it , the worst part was that it sort of looked like dandruff in my hair.Even if I could get past the odd , sticky feel of the product , I would n't want to look like I had dandruff . This is all besides the fact that it did n't really work very well for hair styling either . It did n't really hold or style my hair in anyway.I would n't want any more of this .	-1
Both grandsons said no way to this product . It was awkward to open , messy to use and not worth the price even as a free trial . The hair did not look or feel right .	-1
Wear a mask when you use this product . Seriously , your lungs will have more of it in them than your hair.The canister is tiny . You are paying for less than an ounce of product . Again , most which will be in your lungs . Keep this in mind when comparing products and looking at the price.I did not like this product . I used my teenage son as a guinea pig . The dust is messy . His hair ended up feeling like there was a cement film on it . It looked terrible . He made it two hours before he washed it out . His hair still looked kind of funky until he washed it again.Overall , I 'm not familiar with this type of product . I 'm certain there has to be something better on the market to get the same effect.My recommendation : do some internet research and compare this to other products . I would not buy it or recommend it to anyone .	-1
I expected to open this small container and have powder fall into my hand - like baby powder , I suppose . The dust from this container is much lighter weight than that powder . It 's also translucent and somewhat difficult to see . How much should I use ? I ca n't see it and can barely feel it . Then I put some in my hair and rubbed it around . Plenty went into the air around me ( based on the dust I saw in the sunlight streaming in the window ) , but some certainly went on my hair . My wife said it made it feel `` sticky , '' a feeling which was present for an hour or so . I could easily hand style my hair during that period , but would have needed to replenish the dust thereafter . My wife , just for kicks , tried it in her fine curly blonde hair ; it did n't look like it did anything . My hair , which is less fine ( also less present ) , seemed to be better suited for the product , but I ca n't say I 'll be dusting my hair again in the future .	-1
Back in the day , there was a product called Psssssst ! that would take day old hair and kinda `` fluff '' it . Then we figured out that baby powder would pretty much do the same thing . SO I was interested in trying this new Axe product on my 13 yr old grandson 's messy look hairstyle.First of all , the stuff come in a black container , impossible to see inside . The powder is a very VERY fine dust that is also impossible to see . The directions say to shake it into your hair . Yeah . Not gon na work . You can not tell if any of it is getting into your hair ! Obviously , you need to shake it into your hand instead and then apply it . That worked much more effectively.However , it just did n't seem to do much at all to change the look of his hair . What is did do , is give it a bizarre plastic , glue , gross feeling . He washed it out immediately.For us , this product is a `` fail '' .	-1
Apply to roots and work through and style in a tossed messy hair style . May work for short hair , but my son has 2 to 3 inch curles and did not like this . It did not work as well as Axe messy look styling glueAxe Styling Gum Messy Look , 3.2 Ounce . also did not like the feel of his hair with this in it .	-1
My teenager seems to have developed a cowlick on the front of his head from his winter caps . He does n't seem to take them off anymore . I told him he looks like a mall girl from the 80s but he does n't seem to mind . He tried this but it did n't work on getting rid of that so I took him for a buzz cut . That worked.It kind of did n't do anything to his head of hair . He has very thick hair but other styling products have worked in the past . It says it absorbs oil but would n't any powder do that ? None of us have oily hair so I could n't check it out.This also did not have the signature fragrance that gives advance warning when it is coming into the room . That was the biggest positive about it .	-1
This bottle is much smaller than I 'd imagined . It 's hard to apply because almost nothing comes out when you shake it . Maybe they are trying to stretch this dust further with such a tiny bottle . It does n't do much for your hair either . I would stick to the gel . I really like it . Never heard of a powder or dust for hair anyway .	-1
I got this to try on my husband 's hair and I could n't get it to come out of the container enough . I got some flakes to come out which resembled dandruff ... but it kind of disappeared in his hair . But I felt like it did n't come out fast enough and I was sitting there shaking it for what seemed like forever.Anyway , I got SOME in and I could tell it was doing something . Added volume and a certain texture or coarseness . It had a bit of holding effect too , although I 'd probably finish off any style with just a little hairspray if it was a particularly gravity defying one.But I think all things considered this product is just too weird and different and my husband would NEVER use this on his own . He 'll just stick to his gel because the particles are too hard to see coming out and I had a hard time GETTING them out .	-1
I tried using this product and I just plain did'nt care for it.kinda looks like a salt & pepper/spice shaker.I usually dig Axe products , but this item is the pits , NOT RECOMMENDED !	-1
I have pretty short hair , I get it cut using a # 4 blade on the sides and they scissor cut the top , I normally useJonathan Product Dirt Texturizing Paste ( R ) 3.35 ozorAmerican Crew Pomade 3 oz.but thought I 'd give this a shot . First off , for the price the tube is TINY . I was glad there was no strong Axe scent , but the amount of `` dust '' is just amazingly small . Once in my hair I did n't notice anything . Perhaps my hair type is n't right for it , mine is short , but thick . I 'm sticking with my other go-to products .	-1
My husband generally likes all the Axe products , but when he tried out this one , he found it to be very difficult to apply ( its texture is similar to that of baby powder ) and that it was difficult to style which resulted in a less than stellar look . He ended up just leaving it in since he was just hacking around for the weekend and running errands , but never used it again . Not recommended .	-1
Maybe it 's me , but I do n't get what this product is supposed to do.I 've used Axe products in the past and liked them very much . This one , however , has baffled me . I use the Axe products mainly because of their great scent , but this one has no scent.The package is tiny , and , frankly , it feels empty . I poured the 'dust ' into my hand and applied it to my hair roots , as instructed , but I noticed no difference in my hair.Maybe it 'll work better with short hair ? Maybe it 's something that a salon would be better equipped to apply ? Maybe it 's a prank ? Even some of the descriptions sound odd : `` Leaves hair styled but feeling weightless . '' Huh ?	-1
Been using this product since I got it and I have to say that it is horrible.. It 's a powder for your hair and barely anything comes out of the holes.. To me hair care should be a spray or gel . What does the powder do ? To make matters worse this gets all over the place . Thankfully I got this a s a free product because had I paid for it , I 'd have asked for my money back because I ca n't recommend this product . AXE is known for good quality products and if this is something new they wanted to try then they need to go back to the drawing board .	-1
First of all , be sure you know what you are getting . It 's not a big bottle , it 's way less than an ounce . Also , it 's LITERALLY DUST..not a gel , not a cream , etc . It opens like baby powder , so learning to use this is kind of a step . Then , it did n't do much to lift my hair or give it a messy look..other than kind of dirty . Looking for the grunge look , this might be good for you . I do like that it does n't make hair feel crispy etc . but you should use this on really clean hair , do n't breathe it in , figure out how to apply dust to your hair ... it 's just weird .	-1
I was n't sure what this stuff was when I saw it , but it was pretty self explanatory . You just toss the dust on and rub it in . I put on the exact amount it said , but it did n't all absorb in my hair . It ended up looking like I put some baby powder in my hair . It smells good , but it 's kinda a weird product . I guess if you had super greasy hair this might work , but it seems to me you could just take a shower and wash your hair , so you would n't need this stuff . I wo n't be using it again .	-1
I was very excited to try this , since it seems right up my alley . I have longish hair that goes wild in a bad way after I wash it . Without product , it just gets kind of stringy , hanging in my face , and blowing all over . I use gel to keep it back , out of my eyes , but like it to look like I do n't have anything in there . The problem with gel is that it can clump . I usually need to put it in when my hair is wet , then wait for it to dry ( if I use a hair dryer the gel tends to flake ) , and then brush it through and tousle it a bit.I thought this might be a nice alternative . They say to wait until it 's dry , or to dry it with a hairdryer , and then shake a bit of this onto the roots , and then work it through the hair . I 've tried it for a few days now and I 'm not getting much of a result . It 's possible I 'm not using enough of the dust - but it is really hard to tell how much I 'm using . It 's practically invisible . It 's very light and very fine . I can give a few dozen shakes onto my hand and barely see more than a fine powdery coating on my palm . If I try to shake it on the roots I ca n't see whether any is going on there . So I shake and shake and ca n't tell whether I 'm using too much , but I can feel it a bit tacky in the hair , and still it does n't seem to do much as far as I can tell to add lasting definition . It does something - it seems to thicken it up a bit , but does n't give a `` messy '' look and it 's not enough really to keep it out of my eyes.Too bad , I had high hopes for this one , but at least for my hair it does n't deliver .	-1
This is far and away , hands down , the strangest hair product I 've ever used . The container is tiny and resembles a pre-filled salt/pepper shaker from the dollar store-only smaller . It contains a whopping .035 ounces of granules-smaller than salt grains but not quite powder . The directions give no indication of how you 're supposed to apply it to your hair . I first tried shaking it into my palm and then using my hand to apply it to my hair . This resulted in a small duststorm with a significant portion of the product sent airborne never making it onto my head . With only .035 ounces per container , you ca n't afford that kind of waste ! I realized the only way to avoid this is to apply directly to your head-salt shaker style . The dispenser allows for anywhere from 1-4 holes to be open to control the rate of application , but really you have no idea of how much is coming out , how much is getting on your hair or even how much you should be using in the first place . Furthermore , if you want product on the sides or back of your hair , you have to lean so each surface is horizontal in order to shake the crystals on.Whew-now that I 've gotten my workout for the day , how does the stuff work ? Well , if your hair styles better dirty than clean , this is going to work great for you . It is like instantly dirty hair without any grease . It did give some texture and body to my hair but so would standing in a dusty field for 5 minutes . Considering practicality , cost effectiveness and overall performance I ca n't recommend this product . Stick with any of their spiking glues or messy look gums and you 'll be much better off .	-1
I have used this dust several days now and I have yet to determine if it is actually doing anything . It seems to work as more of a dry shampoo , removing oils from my hair , than a styling product . It does not say how much to use which may be part of the problem . It does smell good , but you need to make sure you give your hair a good tousle so it is n't visible in your hair . As for hold , I do n't think it is effective but maybe I 'm not using enough .	-1
The dust seems to be a unique item , and I was startled to see how small the container was that it came in . I tried using it for several days , but found that it simply made my hair frizzy , and when I tried to run my hand through my longer hair ( like i normally do ) it pulled and stuck . I 'm not sure the right style of hair for this product , but medium-long is n't the right one . At least not my wavy , thick hair was n't the right type of hair . I would n't disregard this product since many find it useful , and Axe puts out great products , it just was n't the right product for me .	-1
My husband has tried 4 of the axe hair styling products , he was not thrilled with this . It 's dust you put into your roots and style . He has a ton of thick hair and it was not for him at all . He also said it feel awkward to put in and he did n't know how much he should have put in , but regardless he did n't like the end result .	-1
I gave this to my 14 year old to try in his hair . I honestly have no words for it . Shake some out ... . ? ? ? What ? Rub it in your hair ? Then what ? `` Style it '' Well , maybe 14 is n't the age to try this , so I gave it a go on his head . I 'm sorry , but I could n't determine just `` how much '' to put in his hair to get it to do what I wanted . Perhaps it was just us . Stick to the Axe Messy Look Gel for better results !	-1
All the Dove haircare smells the same . I do n't like the smell at all . I think it smells like old men . I like clean scents or something woodsy . My husband likes the smell okay , but it 's not his favorite either . Our house is super dry & his scalp gets a bit dry as well during the winter and this did n't stop the mild flaking .	-1
I did n't care for the scent at all . My husband thought it was okay . He has a ton of hair , and did he need this ? No , but it did n't make his hair anymore thicker than it is . He said he liked it fine but it 's not something he 'd want me to purchase .	-1
This was an amazon vine product and I did not even want to review it . If I have nothing nice to say , I rather not say anything . It really did not make scalp any healthier and even the other way around . No bueno .	-1
I am not very happy with this product . While the spray is easy to use and has a pleasant scent , it leaves my hair with that sticky , stiff feeling like I 'm wearing hair spray and worst of all , my hair seems really dry after using it . I have used other heat protection sprays that have worked for me , but would not purchase this one again -- sorry .	-1
My hair is my pride and joy , so I demand a lot from hair care products . I 'm always trying new ones , but unfortunately most are disappointing . Tresemme Platinum Strength Heat Protect spray belongs in the reject pile.To put it simply , this is a cheap spray that left my hair dull and tacky , even though I did not use too much . The odd thing was , after blow drying my hair , I attempted to straighten a few bendy pieces with a flat iron , and the spray prevented me from getting a smooth result . Usually one pass of the iron gives me sleek , shiny hair . I would not use this spray again and I do n't recommend it.The one positive is it has a nice , light fragrance -- more feminine than unisex , though .	-1
I have long hair to the middle of my back that has been color treated for many years . My hair has just enough natural waves to make my thick hair get very 'big ' if I do n't condition and straighten this . I have tried numerous heat protecting products , and straightening aids , and I am not a fan of this Tresemme spray . I think it actually stopped me from getting the straight look I normally have . I also felt my looked dull and lacked movement . Sorry to say this is not for me , because I usually like their other products .	-1
Having used other Tresemme products , I felt safe purchasing this . I like that the sprayer can be & # 34 ; locked & # 34 ; into place to prevent spillage in my suitcase when traveling , however , I do not like the results this spray gives . I purchased this to use with my flatiron . Usually my hair is soft and shiney but after using this , my hair was very dry , felt like straw , and after sleeping on my hair , it was completely frizzed . Having not changed any of my other hair products I know that this was the culperate .	-1
I rarely blow dry my hair so do n't use this product a lot , but the one time I tried it I found it was gummy . But take this with a grain of salt as I have n't had time to use several times and maybe after more use I will like it better . Qualified recommendation .	-1
When I bought my Staighener I figured I would buy a new bottle of heat protectant . Bad idea . When I got this in the mail it had almost completely soaked through the package it spilled out so much . Very poor . Do not buy this .	-1
I looooooved the thermal heat spray so I figured this must be better . Nope . I have dry , brittle and thick hair that looks beautiful with the right product . After using this ( and yes i made a few attempts with different shampoos ) i felt it left my hair rough and dry . Going back to tresemme 's thermal creations .	-1
I ordered this product for my teenage daughter who was worried about drying out her hair since she blow dries it every night and uses heat styling products almost every day . Her hair is slightly wavy , fine , but very thick.She thought the product was a little greasy and found that her hair was more difficult to style after using the product.To be fair , she does n't use any other Tresemme products on her hair , so perhaps it would work better if used with the `` matching '' shampoo and conditioner . In any case , it did n't work for my daughter .	-1
I tried this heat protect spray and while it may help with the heat , it did absolutely nothing else for my hair . In fact , my hair kept getting fine knots in it for days , causing me to break off a lot of hair when I brushed . Not sure if that is because I live in the humid south ? There were no other advantages , my hair did not feel softer , smoother , shinier , etc . I also did not care for the strong floral scent but thankfully that quickly went away once my hair was dry . The only thing I liked was the nozzle that would lock for traveling .	-1
So I follow the directions on the bottle and use this as directed . I make sure that my hair is damp ( after a good towel drying ) and spray it sparingly . There is no smell to this product which is great because I love the scent of my shampoo and would n't want the scent of the spray to mask that . I blowdry my hair in a downward motion to make sure that it really smoothes out my hair . The only thing I really dislike about this spray is that after my hair is dry ( throughout the day ) it feels sticky . Not overtly sticky , but just enough that I can literally tie my hair in a bun with no elastic , tie it in a know and it will hold . Now most girls would think that 's great but not me , sorry . My husband always runs his hands through my hair at some point throughout the day and he literally said , `` Whoa my hand can stick to your hair , did you wash it ? '' . Yeah , that was the last time I used it .	-1
I have fine hair , but a lot of it . And it takes a long time to blow dry . I got this hoping it would keep my hair from drying out too much . Instead , it leaves a sticky , film on my hair . I 'd rather use a deep conditioner and then blow dry so my hair still feels clean after a wash . This may protect your hair after extended blow drying and curling irons . But I probably wo n't be using often enough to see a difference .	-1
I was a fan of Tresemme back when it was n't sold in the common grocery store , yes this use to be sold to hair stylist . I have tried other Tresemme items and I keep hoping that maybe it 'll go back to being great again but so far , I have n't loved one thing from them I 've tried.I have fairly long hair and I hate curling or flat ironing it as it 's so bad for your hair and it makes growing your hair out even harder , so I just do n't do those things to my hair often anymore . I 'm always looking for SOMETHING to help the killing process to go a little slower , this is n't it . The trigger on this came to me broken , so I ca n't tell you how it works . I put this is another spray bottle to use . After just a few days of using I can tell my hair is getting beaten up by my flat iron . I like the way Tresemme smells , but not the way it works . If you think you 're protecting your hair , there really is n't a product that does , some just help so you do n't kill your hair as fast .	-1
I do n't use hair dryers or curling irons often , so perhaps I 'm not the best person to review this product as my hair is n't all that damaged . However , I do n't see any positive difference in my hair when I use it . There is a faint but noticeable odor that lingers after my hair is dry , which I do n't care for . It left my hair a bit crunchy and a residue remains even after washing .	-1
When it comes to heat protection I do n't believe this is a product you should skimp on - go to Ulta and grab something that 's a little more expensive but is actually going to do the job . I noticed no change to my hair after using this product - I just use a flat iron on my bangs to sweep them to the side and this left them looking frizzy and by the next day the style was totally gone . Tossed it out and stuck with my Biosilk .	-1
This shampoo is $ 14+ per bottle . It makes the claim of restoring a youthful appearance and strength to your hair . I saw no change in my hair whatsoever using both the shampoo and conditioner . Paying nearly $ 30 for shampoo/conditioner every month simply because it smells good seems crazy to me . I realize Nexxus is a popular brand and I 've never had complaints about it , but this shampoo and conditioner do n't deliver on their promise . It cleans your hair , it conditions your hair and it smells nice , but I did not notice any difference in shine , texture or otherwise after a month of usage . While I 'm at it , I do n't care for the bottle design and color . Maybe that seems irrelevant , but sometimes consumers buy with their eyes before anything else .	-1
This review may be more about the lack of compatibility between my hair & the product , as all other reviewers are raving about it . I will say when i was young & had thick hair I loved Nexus products.Now I am in my 50 's & balding/thinning on top . Still have long hair in the back & a reasonable amount on the sides . Since this is called `` Youth Renewal Rejuvenating '' I thought it would be a cool product to try . Truth is , after several days of use so far it just makes my hair look older , greasy & like I have less hair than I appeared to have with cheaper shampoos.As my appearance is n't that important to me at my age , I 'll try it for at least a few more days & if something changes I 'll change this review , but at this point I can not recommend this product .	-1
The scent of this shampoo is such a heavy perfume that it actually makes me want to sneeze ( something I prefer NOT to do in the shower ) . I 'm not impressed by how it leaves my hair either - I mean , it seems to be okay , but nothing special , and Nexxus is too expensive for that to be acceptable .	-1
Update December 2013 : I found a shampoo/conditioner combination that really works for me . I 've become very happy withMatrix Biolage Strengthening ShampooandBiolage Fortetherapie Strengthening Conditioner by Matrix . With very little scent and very nice results . Happy from start to finish.Update August 2013 : I 've said several times I do n't care for the scent . Apparently some unwelcome guests do n't agree ! I brought home fruit flies hidden in the groceries . Not usually a problem worth mentioning in a shampoo review ... The fruit flies LOVE Nexus Youth Renewal 's scent and eat any bit of it that might be left behind in the tub or on towels or washcloths . This was all very confusing - to have a growing infestation in the bathroom rather than the kitchen . When I washed my hair I had a cloud of fruit flies following me around the house . Yuk ! I like how the shampoo leaves my hair . I do n't like the scent but fruit flies do . I think that is the breaking point for me . Time for a new shampoo . I hope this helps someone avoid a similar experience.Update July 2013 : I 've ordered my 2nd bottle and received it from Amazon . I was less than thrilled to see the inside of the box wet with spilled shampoo from a combination of rough handling and poor packing . It was a relatively small amount so I did n't send it back.I still like what Nexxus Youth Renewal does for my hair , but I do n't care for the scent.Update June 2013 : I 've been using Nexxus Youth Renewal shampoo for a couple months . I 'm very pleased . My hair seems more managable and feels clean . I got used to the scent of the shampoo and I 'm OK with it . I would prefer there were no scent , but that 's how I feel about most products . I 'm very pleased with the Nexxus Youth Renewal shampoo and my hair feel more full and just nice to touch.Original Review : I used the Nexxus Youth Renewal shampoo for the first time this morning . I also used Nexxus Humectress conditioner , which I 've used for years with various shampoos.My hair was very thick when I was younger . It has thinned a bit with age as happens too often and is more brittle . I 'm hopeful that Nexxus Youth Renewal will help maintain or recover some of what 's been lost.In the shower it usually take two to three passes of my other recent shampoo choices for my hair to really feel clean . With two passes of the Nexxus Youth renewal my hair was very clean feeling . The light scent was not objectionable , though it felt a little too teen for my taste .	-1
( This review is for the platinum conditioner rather than the shampoo -- I was sent the wrong product to review , like many other people . ) Tresemme Platinum Strength Conditioner , 25 OunceI have been told by the resident hair expert who tried this conditioner that it made her hair greasy and gross . Rinsing for ten minutes did little to reduce the heavy , sticky feeling , and she says her hair feels far dirtier than if she had simply skipped shampooing for a day or two . Would not buy this product again !	-1
I wish I could say if this product was good or bad , but as Amazon sent me the wrong item ( conditioner ) I ca n't give a true review of the product . But the conditioner works just fine .	-1
I had the chance to try this product out , so I got it for my wife to use . Typically she uses `` Clear '' brand shampoo and conditioners and she gave this a try . Apparently she did n't care for it compared to Clear as I went into the bathroom and saw the bottle in the trash . It was n't a horrible product , but she did n't care for the smell of it . She is sticking with Clear	-1
I have been using TRESemme ' products for several years now . The one I have been using the most lately is the Advanced Technology Luxurious Moisture with Vitamin E. I was happy to be able to try out one of their other formulas.TRESemme ' Platinum Strength Renewing Deep Conditioning Treatment is packaged in a 6 FL OZ squeeze bottle . It has a claim printed on the bottle that it `` Repairs up to 2 years of damage in just 5 uses '' . I have a problem with blanket claims like this . First of all , how does one determine that the amount of damage to their hair was caused in a time specific period ? Also , do they mean 5 consecutive uses or 5 uses throughout a week , month or year ? I used the Deep Conditioning Treatment for 3 days straight . I shampooed with the TRESemme ' Platinum Strength shampoo as recommended . My hair is medium length and very thick and tangly . I left the conditioning on for the recommended length of time ( 4 minutes ) . Out of the shower I expected my wide toothed comb to glide through my hair effortlessly . It did not . I was surprised to find that I had to use more effort in detangling than when I use my normal TRESemme ' Platinum Strength Strengthening conditioner that is packaged in a 25 oz bottle . So that got me to wondering . I compared the ingredient list on each formula and found that they were nearly identical ! Here are the ingredients for the `` Deep Conditioning Treatment '' in order : Water , Cetearyl Alcohol , Dimethicone , Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine , Lactic Acid , Behentrimonium Chloride , Glycerin , Dipropylene Glycol Fragrance , Amodimethicone , Petrolatum , Mineral Oil , Potassium Chloride , Disodium EDTA , DMDM Hydantoin , PEG-150 Distearate , PEG-7 Propylheptyl Ether , Cetrimonium chloride , PEG-180M , C10-40 Isoalkylamidopropylethyldimoium Ethosulfate , Methochloro-Isothiazolinone , methylisothiazolinone.Here are the ingredients for the regular Platinum Strength Strengthening conditioner in order : Water , Cetearyl alcohol , Dimethicone , Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine , Behentrimonium Chloride , Fragrance , Dipropylene Glycol , Lactic Acid , Amodimethicone , Potassium chloride , Disodium EDTA , DMDM Hydantoin , PEG-7 Propylheptyl Ether , Cetriminium Chloride , C10-40 Isoalkylyamido-Propylethldimonium Ethosulfate , PEG-150 Distearate , Methylchloroisothiazolinone , Methylisothiazolinone.Interesting how similar they are right ? I actually prefer the regular Platinum Strength conditioner over the `` deep conditioning '' formula . At the same cost it is the better value but the BEST value is the TRESemme ' Vitamin E Luxurious Moisture conditioner in a 32 oz bottle with pump dispenser.Read the ingredients and compare them people . Sometimes marketing ( packaging , wording ) is the only difference in products .	-1
i hate products that overexert marketing claims like `` repairs up to 2 yrs of damage '' on your hair . being in the beauty industry , i know how products are over positioned and over hyped.1st of all -- hair is DEAD . it 's not alive . so technically there is nothing to `` repair '' .2ndly , `` damage '' is subjective . it can mean anything from frizziness to split ends . If the claim was `` repairs up to 2 yrs worth of split ends '' , then that would be ludicrous b/c nothing short of glue can mend a split end . so the word `` damage '' is intentionally left as vague.3rdly , `` repair '' is subjective as well ! repair can mean anything from `` smoothing '' to `` healing '' depending on the user 's experience and emotion . so really in this case `` repairing '' means softening and conditioning . WHICH IS WHAT A CONDITIONER IS SUPPOSED TO DO . but `` repair '' is just a stronger marketing buzzword.finally , 2 yrs of damage is a silly quantifiable claim . to get this kind of clinical result , you just need to conduct quick surveys/focus groups . did someone have bad highlights from 2 yrs ago lingering at her split ends ? did the product soften , and smoothe , ( aka `` REPAIR '' ) the dryness and frizziness ? yes ? then great ! ! the data is proven ! in all , it 's not a bad product ( it does what a basic conditioner does ) , but overmarketing leaves a bad taste in my mouth .	-1
One requirement I have for conditioners -- especially so-called Deep Conditioning conditioners -- is that they do n't leave my hair a tangled mess . To me a conditioner that ca n't help a little with the detangling is n't all that helpful . It 's not doing enough conditioning if you ca n't at least partially comb out your hair without using a detangler.Since my hair is long and tends to tangle I do n't set my standards particularly high , and my go to standard is a regular ole Pantene conditioner . On the Pantene Scale ( which runs from 1 to 5 with Pantene being a 4 ) , this Tresemme Platinum Strength Deep Conditioner Treatment gets a 1 . It basically is a negative influence on the appearance , and probably health , of my hair . [ Regular cheap dollar store Suave Conditioning -- which I also wo n't use again -- is a 2 on this scale . ] Now I will say that it did n't leave my hair feeling heavy . No , in fact , after I detangled my locks were kind of fly-away . So no residue , but also no assistance in the detangling process , and so there is no way that I 'm going to give up the Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Conditioner that I just started using , and which is a 5 on the Pantene Scale.Even if you have short hair like my daughter , I think you might was well buy a regular , less costly conditioner by someone else or even Tresemme . No point wasting your money on this one .	-1
I was n't able to use this product more than three days . It is extremely heavy , even for a conditioner , and caused my scalp to break out in a mild rash . I have very sensitive skin , so this is likely not a widespread problem . It did n't make my hair look any better or worse , due to the limited time I was able to use it . It did detangle very well , but that benefit was n't enough to overcome the skin problem . If you have sensitive or dry scalp , you may want to give this one a pass . Otherwise , it seems to be a decent conditioner .	-1
As a previous review I wrote states , I dye my hair and do n't cut it as frequently as I should as I have been trying to grow it back out . My hair is still below my mid back . Back in the day when Tresemme use to be sold to hair stylist and was n't in drugstores and grocery stores , I think it was better but maybe it did n't sell well but I 'm positive it 's not the same ingredients . This did n't improve my hair what so ever . It smells good and it went in nicely but this is no miracle treatment for your damaged hair . If it does anything , it just coats its .	-1
Over the years , I 've used Tresemme 's Anti-Breakage and smooth and silky conditioners . Both of those were fantastic , but this one was not remotely as good as those two , which was odd considering that this was more expensive . I would recommend trying a different conditioner from Tresemme . This one is just sitting in my closet.I found that it had a rather drying effect on my hair . I 'm black with natural hair .	-1
If you want to look like Bozo when you use a `` plump and lift '' product then this one is for you . It did plump but it also minimized all control . I ended up showering again and starting from scratch with my regular hair products . Definitely disappointed . Smelled good though .	-1
I have been using Nexxus products for years and thought this sounded promising . I have aging , thin , baby fine long hair and live in a very dry climate so keeping any semblance of curl is an ongoing problem . I like the feel that this product gives my hair but it just did n't keep the curl in like the Nexxus Mousse Plus . I have tried using both products together but did n't see any improvement . I have also use a thickening product daily and found that the Nexxus Youth Renewal did n't give me that much so much as I enjoy the smell , I will go back to a separate thickening and the Mousse Plus	-1
I really wanted this plump spray to work , because I have very fine , naturally wavy hair that I am constantly fighting with to get volume . But this did n't work for me at all . Not only did it not add any volume , but it weighed my hair down . My hair looks crunchy after using this , and it goes flat in a couple hours.I tried using a decent amount of spray , when my hair was wet and then blow-dried it upside down . I thought perhaps I used too much spray , so the next time I used about half the amount I used the first time . I got the same results . Flat , crunchy looking hair . I do n't know why this does n't work for my hair , as others are raving about it . It smells good , but it just does n't work . It 's pretty expensive , but if you think it might work for you , give it a try . I hope you get better results than I did .	-1
This product has a nice , fresh , fragrance . This spray is supposed to add an 80 % increase in volume , while maintaining touchable softness . I used this spray on half my hair to test it out . While I admit it did not weigh it down and did , indeed , maintain the `` touchable softness '' , I did not really feel it increased volume . The treated side looked pretty much like the untreated side .	-1
I applied this spray as directed and then blow-dried my hair as usual , and I did n't notice any difference at all . It does n't look thicker , more `` lifted , '' or more voluminous . I wish it did , but alas , it does n't . On the plus side , there 's no noticeable scent once it 's dry , but I would n't bother with it again .	-1
I am 56 and have a chin-length wavy bob with long layers and bangs . My hair is medium thickness but is thinning , and I like a lot of volume.I tried this Nexxus Youth Renewal Plump and Lift Blow Dry Spray several times over two weeks , and no matter what I did , my hair ended up baby soft , limp and flat . I tried less conditioner in the shower , more conditioner in the shower , drying with my head upside down , drying standing up straight , drying on high speed/high heat , drying on medium speed/low heat , scrunching when drying , smoothing and lifting when drying , less product , more product ... EVERYTHING I could think of that might be at fault for making my hair end up soft , limp and flat.After trying everything else , I had to conclude it was this product that made my hair baby soft , with no volume and no nice body waves . It actually made my hair flatter and with less volume than NO product on my hair . I 'm definitely going back to my ( cheap ) Suave root boost volumizer and back to my usual volume ! Recommendation : Two thumbs down . This product actually seemed to work against my hair 's natural volume and lift .	-1
I have pretty thick hair , but I usually like to add a bit of volume . Sometimes I use spray and other times I just tease it . The sprays can lead to faster results . I was disappointed by this product . First , I did not notice much in the way of volume . Next , the product left a sticky feeling on my hair . It also did not promote longevity of the hair style . Due to hard water , I try to minimize the number of times I wash my hair in a week ( two to three washes is optimal for me ) . After waking up , my hair was disgusting . It looked greasy and even though it had been straightened the day prior , my hair had a bunch of curls . I would n't recommend this product .	-1
To be fair I used this for almost a month before I wrote my review and I can definitely say this is no miracle elixir . It did n't even work for me.The bottle is fairly small and very expensive . It says to add about 2 drops from the included dropper but when I do that it barely covered my head so I had to end up using a few more drops . Still no noticeable difference even after using it after using the shampoo and conditioner.It does smell good but for this price I wanted to see results and I did n't .	-1
This is a leave-in treatment to use after shampooing and conditioning your hair . It has a light , pleasant scent . Kind of flowery.It comes with a dropper and you are supposed to use 3 to 4 drops of product on damp or dry hair . I have long hair so I used double that amount , but it still felt like hardly anything in my hair . The product has the consistency , and look , of a conditioner . It is not oily . It is not slippery like silicone products . It is not sticky . By the way , this product does not look like what 's in the product photo which makes it look translucent and pink . In reality it is cloudy and white ( like conditioner ) .I have dry , frizzy , color-treated hair . I 'm really not sure what to make of this product . While is contains some good ingredients , the amount used ( even though I doubled it ) is so small as to not really make any noticeable difference in my hair . If I use even more product then this small , expensive bottle would not last long at all . But I tried larger amounts anyway and still had no noticeable improvement.Overall , I did not really notice any improvement in strength or the `` 8 signs of aging hair '' they mention in the product description .	-1
I have tried other products in Nexxus ' Youth Renewal line and have appreciated them , but not this one . I followed directions , but my hair felt coarse after using the product . I tried applying more than directed , but I saw no improvement . I 'm not sure what I 'm missing , but I would say , `` save your money '' .	-1
the bottle is so small 5 drobs minimum will do the need..also becoming dry quickly.what i liked only the smellIguess this will be work for a very short hair	-1
Having enjoyed both the Nexxus Rejuvenating Shampoo and Conditioner , I was excited to experiment with this `` elixir . '' However , my overall experience had such highs and lows that it was actually a challenge to determine the number of stars this product warrants . Here are some thoughts that may assist you , the potential customer : The Positives : -Pleasant smell.-Works especially well withNexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Conditioner , 13.5 Ounce . ( It does not weigh down hair with these lighter products ) .-Requires a few more drops than stated to achieve optimal results ; nonetheless , the bottle will last awhile.-My hair appeared nicely conditioned ( however , I do get consistently better results with Argan Oils ) .The Negatives : -As mentioned here , Nexxus products appear to not be cruelty-free . ( Which I was disappointed to discover ) . For me , as with others , this is a determining factor in many of my purchases . I am more than happy to pay a little ( or even considerably ) extra for products likeJosie Maran Argan Oil ( which I love and will continue to purchase ) . While animal-testing MAY be a necessary-evil in the development of new pharmaceuticals , it is CERTAINLY not needed for my hair serum . And , in all honesty , I do n't want a product that is so far removed from nature that it HAS to be tested . ( Josie Maran Argan Oilis also all natural ! ) I am grateful to those reviewers who noticed this ( since I really did believe that Nexxus was on the cruelty-free list ) .-I believe my real disappointment was the real product versus the promotional materials . What one sees in the picture above is a PINK , TRANSPARENT SERUM that necessitates a dropper-delivery . That is not the case ... at all . It is a WHITE , OPAQUE , THICK , conditioner-like substance . The pictures are truly misleading . Unlike genuine serums ( i.e.Josie Maran Argan Oil ) , this product could easily be packaged in a small , traditional bottle . But it would appear the Nexxus is attempting to capitalize on the serum trend without using the high-quality ingredients the true serums use . ( True serums are like an oil which require a dropper . ) Another reasons why this delivery system is problematic : as a result of the product 's viscosity , it will be difficult to get all of the product out of the bottle ... now , with a true serum , this is no problem : just move the dropper a little to the side and grab those final drops ( or , simply let it drizzle out of the bottle ) . Here , you have to remove the dropper and pound on the bottom just to get the final globs out . Yikes.In sum , this is an inexpensive product for a reason : it does not use the high-quality ingredients that serums use . Moreover , those who use natural products for health reasons will be disappointed here . And , certainly , those who are trying to minimize their impact on the earth/animals can not justify using this `` elixir . '' There are many high-end , luxury oils that are wildly effective and cruelty-free . Buy one of those ... your hair ( and the rabbit population ) will thank you !	-1
I 've been trying , trying , trying Nexxus products for years and have never had a noticeable difference . Never ! I 've started with Nexxus much-applauded Humectress in 2005 and I have tried several products since then and not one made a difference/change in my hair or my daughter 's hair . I have tried their new line and it also does not work FOR ME . Nothing ! These products are specifically made for Caucasian or Mixed-Chicks Hair and that 's just fine . There are plenty and many varieties of products made for African American Relaxed or Natural heads and Nexxus should not be listed amongst these products . Sorry Nexxus but you 've got to make a Line Specifically geared towards AAs to get my money .	-1
It feels pretty WOW when I put this stuff on . Small fancy bottle ... must be amazing stuff . I put it on but I ca n't tell a difference . My bottle is now half empty and I ca n't tell if anything has changed . Should n't I be able to at least tell a difference visually or texturally ? I want to like this stuff . The packaging is enticing me every way to like it - so good job to the marketing department . But there is nothing that is indicating that it is working for me at all . I ca n't justify getting more of this if I ca n't tell anything is happening .	-1
I have very wavy hair that I sometimes dry naturally and sometimes straighten with a good blow dry . I tried this Youth Renewal serum both ways and honestly noticed no difference whatsoever after applying it.It says to use 3-4 drops , which , dispersed in my shoulder-length hair was not nearly enough . I used twice that much and still felt as if there was really nothing in my hair , at least nothing worth noting.It says it will reduce breakage , enhance body and color vibrancy all with a weightless layer . I agree with the weightlessness , as it completely disappeared into my hair and I noticed nothing afterwards . As far as vibrancy of my colored hair , it was actually left a little more dulled , if anything . There was certainly no extra body , though I admit it did not weigh down my hair.I will stick with my preferred Argan Oil or John Frieda Frizz Serum , as they do provide body , shine and a nice silky look to my hair .	-1
I 've used better products . This just made my scalp and hair greasy and did n't & # 34 ; rejuvenate & # 34 ; my old hair at all .	-1
Since I 've been using this elixir , my hair is shinier and smoother , but at $ 14.24 for .094 ounce , it 's just not practical for long hair . I do n't know how other people get away with just a few drops , as I use several on the roots and several on the ends , which has nothing to do with how long my hair is . Then there 's the hair in-between which gets several more drops . All told , I 'm probably using about twelve to fifteen drops . At that rate , this bottle wo n't last very long . There are other less expensive , but equally effective products that are available , such as the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty line of shampoos and conditioners . I particularly like theClear Deep Nourishing Treatment Mask , Ultra Shea , 6 Fluid Ounce.Even though I prefer using unscented products , I do n't mind using scented products if the scent is n't overwhelming . Unfortunately , this product has a strong , sweet , perfumey smell that I do n't like . Even though it dissipates after it 's applied to the hair , I do n't like having to smell it when I open the bottle , and when I have it on my hands.Even though this product works , between the expense and the scent , I ca n't recommend it .	-1
Well I have tried this product for almost three weeks on and off and have yet to get good results . My hair is med-fine and long about 5 '' below my shoulders . It is wavy , light brown , and has some highlights . I tried different amounts in different occasions from 2 drops to about 6 maybe . Too much of this product makes my hair pasty but anything less than 4 drops does absolutely nothing to my hair . I did n't see a difference in shine , or frizz , nothing . I was disappointed . Maybe it is the cold weather not cooperating very well but I am just not excited about this product anymore . It does smell really nice though , but it just does n't contribute anything to my hair . It does n't help my waves either , it just weighs my hair down . Not using this anymore .	-1
I was ready to love this product -- it was to add shine ( I normally use a separate shine spray ) , strengthen my hair and add volume.The positives are that it : Smells niceFeels nice to applyMakes your hair easier to comb through ( right away ) But I did not see it do any of the three things it claims to do.No increase in volume . ( Which makes sense because the way they claim it increases volume is by keeping more hair on your head . It seems like it would take years to notice a difference at that rate . ) No noticeable additional strength was noticed by myself or hair stylist.And it did not seem to do as well for shine once it dried compared to separate products I have used.The other downside was that it seemed to cause more static in my hair for some reason.I will not be purchasing this product again . I will sadly continue the quest for the perfect product.I hope this simple and straightforward review helped you .	-1
I generally like Dove soaps . This one has way too much perfume added though . It 's a strong flowery scent that just does n't appeal to me .	-1
I love Dove . I love how their products lather up and are so rich and creamy . However , I am disappointed in this scent . This scent is so overpowering-so fruity-so despicable- ( I had to add that last one in . In all seriousness I felt like I was going to have an allergic responses . It smells like the lady at Church next to you that douses herself in her favorite cheap fruit splash from Avon or something . It is really that bad . It is not fruity like Bath and Bodyworks . I own those as well and am a collector of parfums . Trust me and pass this one up !	-1
Even though some of the new Dove scents are really good , this one just does n't work for me.I am not a fan of heavy , flowery , perfume smells ; and this one is . It was very strong , and I could even continue to smell it after it was rinsed away.I just could n't use this one , and even though I really like Dove , this scent just is n't one I can use .	-1
I do n't care for heavily perfumed soaps . I like light fruity scents . Other then that it is a basic soap .	-1
While this soap is very soft and silky , I 'm afraid I find the scent overwhelming . My bathroom is relatively small , but the scent overpowers the small room , even seeping into the nearby rooms . The house smells like the soap . Admittedly , I 'm sensitive and can get allergic reactions , so I 'm sure this soap is perfectly wonderful for some folks . But , if like me , you run from candle shops and stay far away from those incense booths at the county fair , you may want to think twice before purchasing this soap.I still like Dove soaps , but I 'll stick with the lightly scented ones . This one just makes me sneeze !	-1
The packaging lists blue fig and orange scents , but when you read the ingredients on the product page at Amazon there is no fig or orange listed , only a long list of chemicals . Some of the packaging for this soap features a sliced ripe fig . If people are attracted to a product by the advertised `` natural ingredients '' , they may be disappointed to learn that that may only apply to a simulated scent . The four oz . bar is fine for the bath , but purchasers who want to add a natural ingredient to their bath soap would have to look elsewhere . Having tried this soap , I think I will stick to an unscented product.From the product page : Ingredients : Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate , Stearic Acid , Sodium Tallowate or Sodium Palmitate , Sodium Stearate , Water , Sodium Isethionate , Lauric Acid , Sodium C14-C16 Olefin Sulfonate , Sodium Cocoate or Sodium Palm Kernelate , Fragrance , Sodium Chloride , Dipropylene Glycol , Propylene Glycol , Tetrasodium EDTA , Tetrasodium Etidronate , Blue 1 , Titanium Dioxide , Yellow 5 .	-1
I like using Dove products because their fragrance is very subtle . WOW , was I mistaken with this one . The `` smell '' is so overpowring that I ended up throwing it to the trash after just one use . I know I am sensitive to strong smells but this is so strong that I developed a headache.If you are sensitive to strong odors , DO NOT buy this product . Stick to the no-odor versions of the soap .	-1
Ugh ! Why does this soap have anything above 3 stars ? Is everyone else delusional ? It smells like weird potpourri and eggs . Maybe I got a bad batch or something . Either way , it was enough for my girlfriend and coworkers to notice the smell . The Dove Men + Deep Clean ( or Extra Fresh ) is 100x better in my opinion . I would not recommend this soap unless you want to repel people .	-1
Nice colors yes but I get this set and the Halo Hues set too ... well they look like the same colorsand is different from they show here on the picture the colors are pastel and look almost like duplicatesI but the 2 sets because want to have more options to choose ...	-1
I was so excited to get and use this hair dryer since I have a ton of thick curly 3b/c hair , the type if hair that can take a full day and a half to dry depending on the weather . I have also used dryer bonnets before and could n't wait to sit cozily under it and let it do all the work . I have a tourmaline ionic hair dryer and it attaches fine.Then I set it on lower heat lower speed settings ... .then I smelled burning and looked at the hose attachment only to see various burn holes appear and grow wider and wider , like it was melting off ! Was it my dryer ? ? I set it in low . I tried to readjust the hose so it would n't lay directly in front of the flow of air . But nothing worked . And the bonnet itself was still happily inflated . I tried for a good thirty minutes because I figured , oh well , might as well get SOME sort of hair dryage out of this thing while I 'm here . Took the bonnet off and my hair which was plopped which meant it was n't dripping wet , was still wet as heck . This dryer is a big disappointment .	-1
I have another dryer attachment I use for when I travel . I saw this and thought this would be better because it has a larger hood . So I took this on vaca and totally regretted it . It sucks ! ! First , the mouth is so tiny it would not fit over my travel blow dryer . I tried it on the wall mounted hair dryer in the hotel , still would not fit . Luckily a friend of mine bought her blow dryer that had one of those rectangle shaped attachments and it fit over that . Second , the air did n't flow through as effective as my other one and it took about 1 1/2 for my hair to dry . I really do not recommend this attachment .	-1
Yuck ! Hate these brushes ... if I could give no stars I would . The only thing that is kinda worth using is the blush brush . I tried to use these brushes a few times but now they just sit in a drawer and I will NEVER use them again .	-1
sometimes it is better to spend good money in one brush than try to purchase more for less . The brushes are a very important part of your make up . You do n't need a lot , but you need good ones . I am not saying all Eco Tools brushes are bad , because I only tested this set , and it is just not worth it .	-1
They are not wide enough , they only go across about half of my eyelid , that I ca n't understand why they would not be large enough to go all the way across . The lashes are find and look natural which I do like . I have tried false lashes before and these are a little nicer than the ones I had tried before . The band was skinnier so it does n't show as much , I could blend it using liquid eye liner so it was n't noticeable . But being that it covers only half the eye is a deal breaker , I have some lashes , very thin but they are the whole way across and it looks odd to only have a lot on one side . I also had trouble putting them on , took me almost an hour , they did n't want to go on right , then they did n't want to stick and I had to keep playing with them . I wish that some company would come out with something that was easy to apply , would stay put and looked natural . My lashes and brows are really very thin and I was really hoping that these would help . I guess I have to keep looking .	-1
I was excited to try these lashes , but they 're seriously odd . The individual `` hairs '' are really long , but they 're super , super thin . Nothing at all like a normal eyelash . They were pretty easy to apply , but did not look natural . You could see my eyelashes , and then growing out if them were these funny wisps -- too long , too thin , too uniform to be anything other than fake lashes . Actually , you could n't even really see them except up close -- their thinness made them blend into my skin . Adding mascara did not help . Bummer .	-1
Ok so these work just fine , functionally- but they look too natural ! When I wear lashes I want lashes ! Big , poofy , over-the-top burlesque queen lashes ! These look like normal lashes . In fact , they look smaller than my normal lashes.I guess they 're fine if you 're missing lashes , but go elsewhere for over-the-top glam .	-1
These had a lot of pluses . This was my first experience with false eyelashes , and application was far easier than I anticipated . The glue did n't have much odor and seemed to dry quickly . I liked that the glue changed color -- it made it easier to apply . Removal was also relatively simple and painless . I have sensitive skin , and had no problems during the brief time I wore them . So no complaints there.Unfortunately , I looked completely ridiculous wearing them . It 's not so much that I looked like I was wearing false eyelashes , although you could definitely tell up close . It looked like I had applied black liner halfway across my eyes and gave up right in the middle . This style is called `` barely there '' and that at least is right -- my eyelashes are very pale red -- pretty much invisible , and these did nothing to enhance them . The shape is definitely not natural , either . They are very long on the outside corner , then fade to almost nothing . To the extent you can see them , it looks stupid.So while the lashes themselves were disappointing , I 'll at least have the glue handy if/when I try falsies again .	-1
-Black woman with 3c/ 4a long hair ( no chemicals to alter texture or color ; use heat once in a blue ) -Right out the box , this was going to change my hair care routine ! Nourishing moist heat to stretch and detangle hair , revive an old style , allows conditioning products to better penetrate the shaft for DEEP conditioning -- -a great product . However , on my 4th or 5th use , the steam would n't come out . So I pressed the button , and just noise and a little steam . WHAT ? So I added more water . Well , it seems to only work when full or near full and then it peters out when a little over half full . I do n't have hard water , however , I have n't tried to clean it with vinegar yet . After each use I empty the reservoir and wipe off the comb part and where the steam comes out to remove product build up and hair . I 'm not sure why it 's so testy . Perhaps mine is defective . I think so . SAD-FACE.UPDATE : I contacted the company and they troubleshooted with me over the phone . It was decided that the connection between the reservoir and pump was n't a good one , so they would send out a new reservoir and we 'll take it from there . Fair enough . Cross fingers .	-1
Very sticky feeling and it stings my face.Did n't bother to finish the bottle , a waste of money for me .	-1
This product is awesome do n't get me wrong but the price that this vendor is charging is excessive especially because you can get this same product for 17 dollars on the lime crime website ! ! !	-1
This product is deceiving . It looks like the perfect red , but when I received it it is a super bright red that looks clownish on my medium deep skin . Pretty upset since I spent $ 20 especially since the formula is super drying ! If bright red dry lips are your thing I highly recommend , but if not buyer beware !	-1
The lime crime is so not for me . This is for 12-15 years old girls I swear . Worst line of products that I have ever buyed ...	-1
Nice set ! ! ! I would of given it a better rating but my caps came unglued to the applicator so it is difficult to open the gloss .	-1
When I put on this BB cream it looked like I was applying Halloween make-up . I was waiting for it to adapt to my skin tone , as many Korean BB creams are good at doing , but this never changed from a shade of white that made me look like a ghost . I was appalled at how bad it was -- I 've never had make-up make me look sick before . It also does n't blend well . Stick with any other Korean brand and you 'll be fine .	-1
been using this thing for over 3 months now ... didnt do anything for me , its not greasy or sticky it does absorbs nicely but as far as doing what it claim no ! dark spots still exist , as for a moiturizer it might be ok but u 'll still need to use a SPF on top of this . i dont recommend this product	-1
I had to come back and update my review . If you have thin hair , do NOT buy this shampoo . It makes your hair feel even thinner . I 'm not sure if it makes your hair fall out , but it just is not worth it . I ended up using the rest for hand soap because I noticed some changes in my hair . One reviewer said her hair started to fall out over a couple of months . I stopped using it at about 2 weeks in . Once I noticed my hair thinning a bit more , I stopped . I 'll never EVER repurchase this product.old review : I do n't think this shampoo does any miracles . It does give a little bit more volume than other shampoos , but another review said it made her hair fall out ! THAT scares me a bit , I have n't noticed anything yet but I 'm going to be very aware . The shampoo is n't as thick of a formula as I thought it was . I really like the conditioner and leave in conditioner from the same line , but the shampoo just is n't anything special . It does the job , but does n't do anything extra . The loreal `` ever '' line is a better deal in my opinion .	-1
I was so excited to try this shampoo/conditioner but I am very disappointed . I have long fine/thinner hair and this has given me nothing but bad hair days for the past 3 weeks . I keep using it because I hate to waste it . It makes my hair look flat and lifeless . I even feel like my hair has been shedding way more than usual . It seems to have so many good reviews , but I guess everyone is different . I really do n't recommend for anyone with fine hair , you will be disappointed .	-1
My hair is thick , naturally wavy , and passed my shoulders . When I get a blow out with curled ends , my hair holds the curl for days as I have a lot of `` body . '' Normally , I will straighten my hair with a hot iron in the morning so I was excited to try these hot rollers and change up my look . Unfortunately , these did not curl my thick hair - at all . It gave it a little body , but you could not tell that I had left in these curlers for over 15 minutes . It was disappointing.The transparent white dot was an easy indicator as to the readiness of the rollers and the hot clips were a nice touch . I laughed at the argan oil , because it was a tiny sample that did not make it through all of my hair . I receive bigger samples from the well-known beauty store in the mall . I am disappointed to say that I can not recommend buying this product if you have thick , hair as I am afraid they just wo n't work for you .	-1
I was excited about these curlers-they take up less room on my bathroom counter , and work just like my other set.I 'm still going to use my other set . These were a pretty horrible experience.To begin , I plugged it in . There is n't an on/off switch-not a big deal , you just plug or unplug . I then noticed there is no place to store the clips . It holds 3 in the case , and as for the rest , well pray you have space/organization somewhere.They heated up very quickly though . I did n't time it , but I believe they were only plugged in for 2min before the indicator light went off . O and on that subject , the indicator light is easily compared to a math test . The instructions sounds easy-it 'll go white . Well SURPRISE ! It 's not that large , easy to see light that turns white . That would be too easy . It 's a light on one particular curler that goes white . It took me a second to spot . Whatever , I rolled my eyes and went on.I picked up a curler . And then dropped it . Because the entire curler gets pretty hot . All my other sets have at least some area that you can grip that is n't as hot as the conducting metal . Not this set ! My finger prints were burned off after use.I manned up though , and proceded to put them in my hair . I figured out that the fuzzy `` non-slip '' part of the curler is actually warm compared to the plastic hot pink ends . And as a side note , if you use the heated clips , prepare for some pain , because those are hotter than you know where.As i was curling , I noticed the clips were not wrapping around the large curlers that I was using . Because I have fairly thick , medium length , silky hair ( especially after using the argon oil . That stuff is why the review gets 2 stars ) and because I 'm not fond of the poodle look , I used the largest ( there are 8 of those ) curlers . I made very certain to place the clips then , because they were n't wrapping correctly , in such a way so as to not achieve the lined look in my hair.How silly of me , because once they were all happily set , and I unplugged it for safety , they began to slip around . What happened to non-slip ? Beats me.I made sure then , to not move around at any pace faster than a slug . I mostly just sat around because I was afraid to do much more movement than breathing . In retrospect , it made no difference . After 15min , the clips had moved around so very much , and of course , as I took out the curlers , my hair had the dreaded lines . Which were even more accentuated by the argon oil in my hair . I brushed my hair with the wide-toothed comb provided , which actually did better than expected , and yes , my hair was curled well . Except for the lines . And it somehow ended up looking very greasy after using the curlers-it did n't before them . Weird , I know.Overall , I feel like throwing the set out of a window , and keeping the argon oil and comb . I do n't believe this was the intended effect Conair was going for . Save your money , these are n't worth the trouble .	-1
Let me draw a rather obvious picture for you before I really dig into my review . When using heated rollers , the user wraps hair around the curler . The layers of hair act as a buffer between the hot curler and the person 's scalp . Just tuck the clip into place and you can go about your business until the curlers cool and you remove them to reveal your curls.Not if you use these curlers , though , because some `` genius '' thought that more heat would improve the curl and figured out a way to heat the clips too . Now , instead of there being any distance between your flesh and heat , there is potentially none at all . This is especially the case along your hair line.The first time I used these , I had slight red marks all along my forehead and my ears were practically glowing because the curlers kept slipping and the heated clips kept touching my skin.Needless to say , I was not pleased.If you already own heated hair curlers , you likely have a set where you can take the clips and store them , either in a space on one side or along the back . Not with this set of curlers . There is nowhere to store the clips for the curlers . They do n't even offer a zipper bag or something for them . You 're on your own . If you have a bag or something in which you can store the clips , good . If not , I would suggest buying something or creating something before you use these curlers because you 'll need to keep rotating new clips onto the heating element to get the full benefit of those heated clips.Of course , the obvious solution is simply to not put the clips on the heating elements . Sort of defeats the purpose of actually having heating clips . But if you 're like me , you probably do n't want your ears and forehead to be bright red and would prefer not to experience the discomfort of the heated clips anyway.A poorly thought out and very poorly designed set of heated curlers .	-1
I got the Old Spice High Endurance Pure Sport Scent Bar Soap because I was looking for a cheaper soap than the gel . However after using the bar soap , my skin was left feeling very dry . I was told that this is a common feeling with any bar soap but I could n't stand it , so I will definitely not buy the bar soap again despite being a bit cheaper and still having the pleasant smell like the gel .	-1
The smell on this one is OVER powering like it began to over power my bathroom , then , hall way , then stairwell , to kitchen living room and bedroom , it literally was making house smell like soap in a day . I puked . it cleans like soap but really , do you really have to make it so stinky ? what 's the point of having a soap that over powers like that . Who use this anyway ? How stinky do you have to be ?	-1
I have naturally curly 3 a-c hair and this product left my hair hard , dry and frizzy . I used a leave in conditioner before and a little oil after and it did n't matter . The jar is still sitting in my closet because I do n't want to throw it away because its paid for , lol .	-1
Not impressed at all . It was no different than the rest of the Hydration Hair Masque I have used . Not to much to say but it is not worth the cose .	-1
this color does not at all look as good as it does in the picture , it 's a milky semi-translucent white filled with multi-shaped glitter , i would not recommend this and if i could return it i would	-1

I do n't like the rough texture that the bits of coloured & # 34 ; confetti & # 34 ; leaves on my nails . I wo n't be buying this one again .	-1
These are hit & miss , even on the same set of nails ! ! I do n't know what it is about this gel , but it takes forEVER to harden , and sometimes wo n't ! ! I do n't take more than 2 hours per set of nails & spent 4 HOURS doing ONE SET because this gel is s***.DO N'T BUY IT !	-1
A for communication effort , unfortunately that is all I can say about this . The colors look bright in the photos .	-1
Not recommended . It does not last . Does not wear like Gelish brand at all . I 'll pay more and stick to something that works . I threw these away after 1 use because they did n't wear like professional products do .	-1
It burns , It does n't dry right , it does n't soak off ... overall awful experience using . I suggest sensationail brand LED gel . It does n't burn , and its much easier to get off ... and it probably has safer ingredients .	-1
do n't be fooled ... .these top coats take a long time to dry and they are sticky . even using alcohol makes it dull . The UV machine I bought is worthless ...	-1
The fumes will knock you out ! make sure you are in a well ventilated area . The base coat is ehh and the top coat is okay but using them both together sometime makes it hard to take the gel off . The fume the top coat give off are very strong . And it only works with UV and now I onto LED	-1
Results are so minimal the price is just too high per month for myself . Makes hair greasy after gets In system , I prefer high omega 3 and 7 to this with biosil .	-1
I started taking this product 8 months ago as part of my Hail Mary attempt to regrow my AGA related hair loss . I use to take the purple box viviscal but stopped when they reformulated it to include zinc and iron which I did n't want to take . When I found these with the high dose of the Amar complex I got hopeful . So far , I see minimal to no betterment with my hair . My existing hair looks the same and has n't gotten thicker or started growing faster . Shedding is still a problem , I have no regrowth on the AGA balding and my hair is as thin as ever . After 8 full months I expected some betterment or at least thickening . This is a fail for me .	-1
Goes through batteries quickly . Did n't really see any results .	-1
The worst product ever it 's messing it just all pour out at once and it 's like you only get a few drops on bottle ! Would n't but this brand again ever !	-1
This primer is nothing more than vinegar in a bottle . it has the strongest vinegar smell and my acrylic started to lift the next day ! It was honestly better when I did n't use a primer at all ! It was cheap but defiantly DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ! ! ! The only reason it gets one star is because the shipping was extremely fast .	-1
Horrible ! It does not dry for a long time , and it smells horrible ! Just breathing through my nose made me feel like my nose was on fire ! And the smell stayed even after it dried . If you have ever taken a deep breath in through your nose in the sauna , that is what it feels like . Do not buy this product !	-1
This product is so strong i smelled it before i even opened the package actually im afraid to use it because it says not to let it touch the skin cause it will burn .	-1
I ORDERED THESE BECAUSE I SAW A NAIL TECHNICIAN USE IT BUT THIS IS SO NOT WORTH IT I LITERALLY HAD TO USE A TUBE PER NAIL AND SOME OF THE GLUE HAD ALREADY FORMED A HARD CRUST BEFORE I EVEN OPENED THEM	-1
This glue is a reflection of the price . Its not worth it . It does n't hold or adhere to anything . A little disappointed	-1
I honestly do n't know if this is glue or water ... This glue is worse than the fake nail glue they sell at drugstores ! I used to this glue to re-attach one of my acrylics that had fallen off , and it fell off again after about 5 seconds . Do not waste your money .	-1
It as ok , It did the job for a little while but all the bottles were half empty . I do n't know if it dried up inside or what , but majority of the glue was gone .	-1
While the price for these items are great , they are not very effective . Save your money and buy another brand of nail glue .	-1
it dried up , and some of it turned to gel . hard to open , hard to use , not as much liquid as you would think . over all bad quality .	-1
All of these glue sticks were dry . I cut one of them open and the glue had been frozen ? Idk why but this purchase was a waste of money . Not happy	-1
Super glue in a cheap bottle ! Poor tip ... should be a finer end . Could have picked up at the dollar tree cheaper ! Anyone notice the good reviews are in broken English ?	-1
These bottle are small and quite runny . One of the bottles will not open because it was stuck . Apparently we got a bottle that was punctured and the glue sealed the cap . Will not purchase again . I prefer glue with a longer application nozzle that is easier to cut .	-1
I have n't used them yet but I ordered the 5 pack and I do n't even think combining the 5 bottles would make a full one . They did arrive a week and a half early ... . Should have just went down to the dollar store .	-1
Bottles are nota full . They are about half way full , or empty i should say . Not getting muy money ` s worth . Will not recommend it .	-1
i did get 5 of them so they werent lying about that . i do my nails all the time so i thought this would be great so i could be stocked up..negative ! ! they are extremely hard to squeeze so barely any glue comes out . i put the glue away and my box and the next day when i opened my box they had spilled all over . i was so mad ! ! i guess you get what you pay ! next time 'i 'll go to wal-mart and buy them .	-1
Most of the 5 bottles I received had little to no glue in them . They were dried up and had crusty pieces under the cap .	-1
The glue would n't come out it was so hard I had to cut it ! Defeated the whole purpose I had to throw it out . Wasted my money / :	-1
Something I 've discovered over the years is that more blades does not make for a better shave . Of course in commercials it always looks great , but then you remember the models they use only had like half a day 's growth before they started . Any razor can shave well with that.Anyway , I put this up to a real test and it failed miserably . Basically I 'd let my beard grow for about a month . Mind you mine never gets to look like Grizzly Adams or ZZ Top or those Duck Dynasty guys . It does get a bit scruffy.As I said , this razor failed miserably . I might as well have shaved with a butter knife for all the good it did . The really cheap two-blade razor I used worked a lot better to cut down the stubble . I let this Schick do mop-up duty . That 's about all it 's good for.So this flimsy razor is fine if you do n't have much to shave.That is all .	-1
When I removed the razor from the package , I literally laughed . It looks like something straight from a Saturday Night Live sketch : `` Why buy a razor with three blades when you can have one with fifteen ! ? '' The over-sized appearance is super silly . Moreover , I have gotten much closer shaves from a `` simple '' ( and less expensive ) three-blade razor . This one is a bit cumbersome . Additionally , I first used it with a lotion and the razor skipped over and over . Then , I tried it without lotion , and it gave a better , but awkward shave . My underarms were left `` prickly '' even after several passes.If it matters , the aesthetics appear as though it is a generic razor . The instrument is a flat , opaque color . And , for me , was definitely not ergonomic . ( It feels/looks like something from the 1980 's with extra blades ) .In this case , for me , less is certainly more .	-1
These are not great but they are still much better than the Schick Hydro silk version for women . They are not irritating . The Schick Hydro has a lubricating strip which is more sticky than lubricating . But it did not leave my skin irritated.The Schick Hydro did leave me with hair still on my legs though . It is pretty annoying . I am at a loss at to how 5 blades are an advantage if they are still missing hair . I am better off with with a cheapy one blade mans schick disposable and a bottle of shave gel .	-1
I expected these razors to be really great ! I mean Schick is a brand name . They boast FIVE blades . But they were a huge disappointment to me . The blades do not seem to catch at all on the stubble . It took two swipes to shave my legs before they were smooth . Also , it seemed on the curved portions like knees that the razor seemed to take more `` do-overs '' also . I was disappointed .	-1
This razor has 5 blades and a built in shaving gel . The razor head is really too big now and did n't get into tight places . My son said he had to go back to using his smaller razor to get around his neck and ears . Because the head is so long it missed areas around mouth even with sticking his tongue in cheek . He also did n't like the gel , said it was goopy and left his skin feeling filmy . Overall , pass on this one and go with a 3 Blade ; he likes theGillette Mach3 Sensitive Disposable Razor 6 Countand I like theBic Soleil Twilight Disposable Razor , Triple Blade for Women , 4-Count .	-1
I 've used a lot of disposable razors in my time , and while my strong preference is for the non-disposable razors , I have used disposables that impressed me . This unfortunately was not one of them.First , it is extremely awkward to use . The handle feels flimsy , and is poorly designed giving little control . There are no grips on the handle , so using this in the shower is a very painstaking process , as I constantly lost my grip . It did not do well over curves ( ie knees , underarms ) and these parts had to be gone over a couple of times . The razor itself did feel comfortable , and somewhat hydrating.The overall results were not terribly impressive ; my shave did n't seem to last as long as with my regular razor . Overall this product 's design made it very tedious to use , with results that are n't worth the effort . I can not recommend this product .	-1
After reading the hype , I expected these Schick razors to be the best ever . They are not and are disappointing . They just do n't cut it the way you would expect a premium multi-blade razor to be . I expected that they would just smoothly and easily cut but they act like they are slightly dull or how a well used razor would feel . I normally use a Gillette Fusion and when new , it cuts like like a hot knife through butter with no drag whatsoever . I compared my well used Fusion razor to this Schick and the used Fusion is better , much better . I went back over the same area with the Fusion after using the Schick and it was like I had missed half the stubble . I am also not sure whether this Schick hydration claim is for real or not . If it had shaved as greatly as it is supposed to then there might be some validity to it . This ends up being an expensive razor and not a good value though because of its poor performance .	-1
The Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razor , 3 Count is a disposable razor that claims to moisturize the skin for up to two hours post-shave . I can not comment on this claim , as I found the hydrating bar stuff to be too slimy to leave on my skin . It was gross feeling , both slimy and yet sticky.The shave : the razor provided a decent quality shave , comparable to other disposables I have used , but not as good as my Venus with replaceable blades.The handling : slightly awkward . The five blades make the head bulky , and the nature of the housing makes limits the flex of the blades , making it difficult to get a good close shave with one stroke.The moisturizing : addressed in my first paragraph.What I did like was that the angle of the handle elevates the head of the razor off the surface on which it is resting . This prevents the moisturizing goop from getting on my tub ledge , and keeps the blades out of any water accumulation on the ledge . No better or worse than other products of the same type .	-1
Works ok. Too light weight , makes it hard to hold and use . Awkward . I will not be buying this again . Just do n't like the design .	-1
It 's hard to find very much to say about these since they were so awful . The razor was sticky hard to maneuver . I am not sure what is supposed to be appealing about making the razor gooey but it is nowhere near `` silky '' . I had to go over my legs twice but when I rinsed I still had hairy legs . I can barely muster enough interest to shave my legs once . Shaving twice and still having hair legs is right out of the question . I also had nicks where there had been bumps on my legs.Lastly , my legs were as dry and irritated as if I had dry shaved . So I had hairy , bloody , red itchy legs . This is a look I can not rock.Pass .	-1
The shaving surface on this razor is so wide that it does not get well into facial crevices where a lady of a certain age has to shave off `` misplaced eyebrows . '' It does not cut the hairs off as close as the inexpensive razors I have been using . I was , to be repetitive , very disappointed . However , if the ONLY thing I wanted to shave with it had been legs , it might have been nice .	-1
The first shave with the Schick Hydro Silk was great ; but it was down hill from there . My second use involved a lot pulling . I had gone three or four days ; I was able to shave but that second shave was a painful one . I 'll use the ones I have ; but I wo n't be buying again . If you do n't have coarse hair you may be alright ; I was n't .	-1
This product is very disappointing . An ideal razor is one that gives a close shave without causing razor burn . This product attempts to do that by putting a 'hydro ' gel layer around the edges of the razor . The gel layer disperses a soap like substances as you shave . I did not like the feeling of this gel-like substances at all . It was sticky and hard to get off . Additionally , it made it so that I could not achieve a close shave no matter what I did . The razor was just gliding across the skin and not catching the hairs . And to make matters worse , it still gave me razor burn . There are much better razors out there .	-1
I just could n't like this razor . I travel a lot and a good disposable razor would be a great find , but with this one I simply feel that five blades was too many . On top of that , the `` moisturizer '' was slimy and did n't seem to actually work as claimed - my skin certainly did n't feel `` more moisturized '' or moisturized for longer.The only reason I gave it two stars rather than one is because it definitely gives a better shave than truly cheap disposable razors ... but for the price I feel that I might as well have gone out and bought a second razor and extra blades to travel with , thus guaranteeing myself a good/proper shave .	-1
very deceiving product description ... and even reviews . I own both a con-air and a Revlon and the diffuser does not fit . buyer beware these are UNIVERSAL to the Bio Ionic dryers only . Super bummed .	-1
It 's hard to believe that Remington could produce such a flawed dryer , but they managed to do so , with this model.First of all , it 's larger/bulkier than it needs to be , so just storing it on a bathroom counter top or wherever , requires more space than normal . But the real design flaw with this dryer is its heat control . It has only two fan speeds , which might suffice if they had gotten the heat control designed correctly . Instead , one of the three heat settings is useless ( the lowest setting supplies almost no noticeable heat ) , and so you really have less heat `` range '' than many other hair dryers.So the lowest heat setting provides virtually NO heat at all , the second ( `` medium '' ) setting provides about the right heat for many people 's hair , while the third ( high ) setting is quite hot , so you have to be careful using it . Because the useful number of heat & fan settings are so limited , there is no excuse for this hair dryer to be as bulky and heavy as it is .	-1
I 've used many hair dryers over the years , from high-end to drugstore brands . This particular dryer is nothing special.On the plus side , it is very lightweight , so might be a good choice for someone with impaired arm strength . But the reason it 's so light is it 's very cheaply made . In addition , it does n't get very hot or blow that strongly . Every time I use it I stop to see if I have it turned all the way up . It also has an abnormally short cord . I did n't notice it at first because I stand close to the outlet , but when I went to dry my daughter 's hair , it did n't reach where she normally stands . Never had that problem with other dryers.And if I may address the `` ionic generator creates 90 % more conditioning ions , leaving you frizz-free '' nonsense ... . come on . It sucks air in one end , heats it , and blows it out the other . There are no magical particles inside waiting to give you the hair of your dreams . Alas , wish it was true , but it 's not.Overall , while this dryer is n't horrible , there really is no compelling reason to buy it .	-1
There are studies out there that say antibacterial soap does more harm than good , for a variety of reasons , and I 'm inclined to believe them . Antibacterial properties and all , I 'm not a fan of this soap . It sloshes around like water in the bottle but gets pumped out as foam , an odd thing . Its scent is supposed to be creamy vanilla orchid , but my wife and I do n't smell much vanilla . The smell is kind of synthetic , actually , not entirely horrible but not totally pleasant either . My wife compared it to the smell of a household cleaning product.To be fair , my stepson likes how this soap smells , and I have no doubt it kills lots of germs -- probably too much bacteria for its own good . All in all , I 'd feel better using regular bar soap or just plain old hand lotion soap with no added , fake frills .	-1
I tossed this stuff hours ago when I noticed that my receipt that I was gon na use to return this junk expired exactly today . Yes , it does stink , like the top negative reviewer noted . It also is not mascara- it is a form of cheap paint for preschoolers . & # 34 ; Clump City & # 34 ; was the title of every mascara episode for a few months in my house before I got smart . I have been using Almay products for years with no problems until now . No desire to bat my lashes with this product .	-1
There are all clumps on the brush when u take it out of the mascara tube . Does not work like i thought it would . I could have got a better deal .	-1
I usually love Almay products and have purchased various Almay mascaras and eye shadows many times over the years . This product caused by eyelid to blister and eyes to get watery and runny . Not to mention that it also smudges and smears terribly . I threw it away . Would definitely not purchase this type of mascara again .	-1
I remember my Mom had a lighted make-up vanity in the 80 's . The mirror in the center switched from normal to magnified and the lights switched to different shades of color that were supposed to simulate the light conditions for whatever time of day you were applying make-up for . This mirror is exactly the same thing . It even had the same eighties look to it . It is lightweight and feels kind of cheap , and the light colors do n't change easily . It sticks when you are switching from one time of day to another . The knob actually flew off the first time I used it . It popped right back on , but I think it 's only a matter of time before it breaks permanently .	-1
I am so displeased with this product that I am earnestly baffled that it has any positive reviews.First , it 's huge and more than half the size is the plastic frame part . The mirror itself is small , smaller than an average hand mirror . Worse , the plastic is n't nice plastic . It looks ugly and it does n't feel sturdy.Mine also has a message *printed* into the plastic that says `` Rotate mirror up to close side panels '' - only this model does n't actually have side panels . That screams cheap to me . Like the company used leftover parts to make this.There is a little slider that is supposed to change the light for day , office , home , etc . But just moves a colored film in front of the light bulbs . Not helpful at all . The `` office '' one is particularly bad , because the film is blue-green . No office looks like that . Perhaps if they called it `` aquarium '' ... The slider and films also feel flimsy and rickety ; the sliding motion is n't smooth.The mirror has a 5x side , you can rotate it so that side is facing front . But , like most magnifying mirrors , you have to be in the exact right spot to get a clear picture . Unfortunately , that spot is about 1 inch away from the mirror ... which means the light bulbs are right next to you , shining in your eyes and not lighting your face evenly.The lights are really bright . Other than that , this product has no positive features . I 'd rather use ANY other mirror in my house than this one .	-1
Very surprised at this Jerdon lighted makeup mirror . My sister is 8 years older then me and when we were younger my parents bought her a mirror EXACTLY like this for her 16th birthday . Well ... a few things are different but the basic setup is the same . The adjustable settings for lighting in daytime , evening , home and office environments is hilarious because the selections could n't be more off ! The mirror takes up so much space on the countertop and the added outlet on the side would never be used in our household as the mirror is n't very sturdy and could fall off the countertop if the wind blew . One bright spot : the 5x magnification .	-1
This one of those products that looks better on the picture than it really is.This was used mainly by my mom and she was'nt impressed with it , as she did'nt care for the lights on the product.I guess this mirror might be liked more than others , but most of the time my mom goes back to to tradtional bathroom mirror.She does use it once and a while though , when the bathroom is occupied.Like I said , this product was'nt a big hit in our household , its just okay .	-1
This mirror is bulky and feels cheaply made . It has four different light settings and 2 mirrored sides . The lights are on a slide that requires using both hands . One to hold the unit and the other to push the bar . If you try one handed you 'll simply push the unit off the counter . The lights are on each side and do n't move . The mirror is two sided and flips from normal to 5x 's magnification . This design would be for use on a dressing table , where you could sit in front of it . I stand in front of the bathroom mirror to apply makeup and tweeze brows . There is no way I can stand and angle the mirror to reflect the lights needed to use . This simply does n't work for me , and reminds me of the old time lighted mirror my Aunt had when I was a kid .	-1
I was hoping this would be a keeper , but it really is n't . It 's cheaply made and rather bulky.The pros : - There is a convenience outlet on the mirror 's frame . This allows other appliances to be plugged in if the mirror is taking up the only outlet available.- The stand is adjustable , allowing for different angles that will accommodate the user 's position.- The mirror is two-sided - one side is 1x and one is 5x.- There is a slider to change the lights ' hue : Daylight ( the bare fluorescent bulb ) , Office ( +green ) , Evening ( pinkish lavender , Home ( full pink - flesh ) The cons : - It 's just cheap-looking and not terribly sturdy.- It 's too big to fit on most bathroom countertops or dressing tables ( if anyone has those anymore ) .- The color choices are minimally effective.- The box indicates that there are three options for magnification : 1x , 5x , or 10x . There are only two mirror options , so I 'm not sure if they are referring to one 's distance from the magnifying mirror , which , frankly , does n't work because of the issue with limited focal point of the concave mirror.- There are instructions on the frame : `` Rotate flat mirror up to close side mirrors . '' Since I could n't find any side mirrors , I could n't figure out what needed to be closed . Then I realized `` close '' is an adjective not a verb . It 's simply stating that one needs to turn over the flat ( 1x ) mirror and rotate the magnifying mirror ( 5x ) into position . Well , duh.- `` Florescent '' is spelled wrong on the box ; it should be fluorescent . Oh yeah . I take off points for spelling.- There are two 6 watt fluorescent bulbs that , according to the instructions , `` should never need replacing . '' This is followed by instructions stating that should they need replacing , the unit must be returned to the factory or installed by `` competent electrical appliance personnel . `` In short , this might work for a young girl who 's playing with make-up , but really does n't seem to fit an adult 's lifestyle , at least not as a product that is prominently displayed . Perhaps it could be used temporarily , placed back in its box , and put in the closet .	-1
The design of this product whose intent is to beautify is ugly . The product is inelegant , like a lump of white plastic . There are more stylish makeup mirrors out there , fortunately . You may differ in opinion as beauty is definitely in the eye of the beholder .	-1
I acquired this product through the Amazon Vine Program , although the usual green writing saying so may not appear above.Every hotel I 've ever used a swivel mirror at , the maid puts it back so that it tilts toward the floor every day . So for once , it 's nice to be able to have some control . Even as a guy , I find these types of mirrors quite useful for putting in contacts and making a quick check to see if I missed a spot shaving or if a nose hair is below where it should be.I find that the lights and mirror on this product - the obvious most important parts - are of pretty good quality from a functional standpoint . The mirror is clear and the lights supposedly should last forever.Unfortunately , everything else I find less appealing : There is a permanent sticker on the top that says `` Rotate flat mirror up to close side mirrors '' . Beyond the fact that this mirror is obviously the base for another product in the Jerdon line , I 'm not such an idiot that I need a permanent reminder . A removable sticker would have sufficed . The plastic housing has a general cheaper feel to it , there are no options for wall mounting , the light covers look like they could pop off at any minute , and the light adjustment slide is choppy and rough to slide.Finally , it annoys me that they put a two-prong outlet on the front of the device with another marking that says 1400w max . How many of you girls know the wattages of all your other bathroom appliances ? To me , this is at best a nuisance and at worst a fire hazard . Would have been better just to make the device 's cord 14 gauge and make the outlet a full grounded 15a outlet , and then no marking would be necessary.I 'm obviously not impressed with this product . But truthfully , I 'd try another Jerdon product , just not in this style . I say that because the mirror itself seems to be just right . I 'd be interested to see if their hotel style , metal framed flip mirrors have a better feel to them .	-1
This makeup mirror is just like the one your mom had in the 60s , but now it 's even cheaper and flimsier ! Hooray ! I find the mirror 's stand in the back to be so flimsy , I would n't be surprised if this did n't last even 6 months before breaking . The magnification side of the mirror itself just looks a little 'off ' someone , too ( hard to describe -- sort of a 'fun house ' effect ? ) There is also a big ugly PERMANENTLY PRINTED `` Rotate flat mirror up to close side mirrors '' just above the mirror ( yes , printed on the white plastic itself -- and no , it 's not a removable sticker ! ) This part is especially amusing , since there ARE no side mirrors ! Steer clear of this one .	-1
I was super looking forward to trying this mirror . I do n't have a lighted mirror and I 'm often wondering if I 'm wearing too much make-up or not enough . There 's a huge difference between the look when I put on my make-up in my well lit but no natural light bathroom and when I get in the car . In the bathroom , I think I 've put so much on and then when I get out to my car , it does n't look nearly enough . I thought , `` finally , I 'll get it right . `` First , the pros : - design size itself is decent looking ; not too big and not to small , although a bit too big for my dresser or bathroom counter-the mirrors are clear and large enough to frame my entire ( big and square ) -I like that I can plug it in-the extra outlet in the front is nice and useful- easy on/off in the frontThe Cons : -the design is cheap looking and chintzy- the color is `` meh '' -the light settings are not really reminiscent of the places they are supposed to mimic , in fact , they are quite off-the magnification looks very distorted and weirded but I 've noticed that in other magnifying mirrors too- the lights on the sides do n't fold in , kind of lights the room better than my face-the folding stand in the back is very temperamental and prone to collapsing . I would have like it better if I could have figured out a way to hang it .	-1
mmmm its not good ... it gets stiky ..	-1
Glitter was everywhere when order came . Of course the one color I needed was completely empty because it emptied all over the place . Caps were not on tight on any of them . More than half the quarter size tubes were empty . Very unhappy . Would get a better deal at Walmart .	-1
This is a very dark color . BE FOREWARNED . I thought it would be a more of cherry red with some darker glitter.Its a very dark gothic looking color . Oh and be sure to read their return policy before buying . Not only is this an expensive item to begin with - costly to take the risk if you do n't like the color . 30 % restocking fee AND you have to pay return shipping and return original packaging . WHAT ? Yeah . So I wasted $ 20 on lip gloss that was WAY too dark . Learn from my lesson and do n't order .	-1
Not much in containers.CO	-1
Received the same amount as in the picture but the colors shown in the picture were not the same as the colors I received	-1
It 's like lint in little tins , It shows it as & # 34 ; beautiful & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; velvety & # 34 ; but it 's just gross . Very disappointed ... I wish I did n't buy it .	-1
I wanted this to work so badly . I have very dry skin and summer is here . My skin can look just awful in dry heat . This gel has a very cooling feel on the face , love that . In the morning it gives a bit of a wake me up , like all my gels I keep this in the fridge . So the extra bit of coldness is lovely . At first , maybe wishful thinking , I thought this gel was great . It applies really smoothly and sat under my makeup easily . But not even an HOUR would go by and my skin would just look so dull . I changed up the routine , applying this gel directly out of the shower , prepare for work , then applying another layer before I applied my makeup & # 8211 ; - an hour later & # 8211 ; & # 8211 ; DULL.If you have very dry skin , like myself , I ca n't recommend this product . I am still on the hunt .	-1
This did not last very long , and it did n't really help my skin ... did n't hurt it either but ultimately not great , and overpriced . I 'd recommend the Alba Botanica moisturizer instead . Plus they do n't test on animals !	-1
I bought this product hoping it would help with my very dry , flaky skin . For starters , it smells like a heavy perfume . It was extremely overpowering . I used this for a few days , and my skin was actually feeling flakier . I read the ingredients and # 3 on the list is denatured alcohol , which explains why it was drying out my skin . This is a waste of money , and I do not recommend it .	-1
I bought this to use it to straighten and style my wavy hair instead of using my flat iron hoping it would cause less damage . This thing is a waste of time and does n't give you the results . It pulls on your hair and causes them to break . It does n't provide enough heat to style your hair either . I returned mine and would not recommend it .	-1
I really , really wanted to like this brush . The reviews were great , I even watched some youtube videos . But none of them mentioned the fact that this brush snags your hair like crazy causing breakage and pain ! It did not cut down on styling time , you take just as long using this as you would round brushing your hair .	-1
This is a great concept and the brush turns perfectly . But the heat and power is not enough to hold the style .	-1
I 'm not happy with the effect this product had on my hair . I have very long wavy hair that tangles easily . This conditioner ( used along with the same type Nexus Shampoo ) left my hair feeling rough and worst of all it was extremely difficult to pull a comb through it either wet or after it dried . It did leave my hair fuller but with lots of fly aways . I intend to experiment by leaving more of the product in after shampooing though I 'm leery of that for fear it will weight my hair down and cause limpness .	-1
This conditioner is $ 14+ per bottle . It makes the claim of restoring a youthful appearance and strength to your hair . I saw no change in my hair whatsoever using both the shampoo and conditioner . Paying nearly $ 30 for shampoo/conditioner every month simply because it smells good seems crazy to me . I realize Nexxus is a popular brand and I 've never had complaints about it , but this shampoo and conditioner do n't deliver on their promise . It cleans your hair , it conditions your hair and it smells nice , but I did not notice any difference in shine , texture or otherwise after a month of usage . While I 'm at it , I do n't care for the bottle design and color . Maybe that seems irrelevant , but sometimes consumers buy with their eyes before anything else .	-1
I had high hopes for the Youth Renewal line from Nexxus . I have really liked Nexxus products in the past.This is a concentrate feeling conditioner . It is thick rich . It smells great . But it rinsed out leaving my hair feeling very dry . As it dried I had horrible tangles . I have very long hair and avoiding tangles is paramount . I tried is several times but each time I ended up with bad tangling and dryness . It did seem to give volume . But overall I saw no noticeable Renewal of Youth . There are definitely changes that our hair goes through as we age but there are better products for addressing them .	-1
I have long-ish , flat , easily tangled hair . I tried this conditioner and it did nothing to improve my hair 's texture or shine . In fact , the opposite -- it seemed to emphasize the flyaways and make my hair look more damaged than it is.It 's funny how the same product can be so good for some people and bad for others . I guess that 's just how beauty products are ... I see that most people loved this conditioner , so I 'm sure it 's not just terrible quality , but it sure did n't work well on my hair type .	-1
One of the main disappointments for me along the road of aging was the rough , course texture my hair took on in my 40s . That was the first time I started to panic . Since that texture has remained with my hair , good conditioning is key . Currently I use a well known but inexpensive brand I get when I buy my groceries , and I 've always wondered whether pricier brands like Nexxus would work even better . Other pricier brands might , but Nexxus does n't . I found that the rough texture I try to keep at bay returned only a couple of hours after conditioning . It could be that this conditioner works better with other hair types , but if your hair has a similar texture , I would try another product .	-1
Makes scalp greasy , and if you & # 34 ; comb & # 34 ; it through , masses of hair come out ! No magic rejuvenation for MY hair ! Not worth the price and the special order .	-1
After using the Nexxus Youth Renewal Shampoo and liking it , I decided to purchase the matching conditioner . Unfortunately , I 'm having a problem with it . After using it ( I shampoo and condition my hair in the shower ) , there remains a scummy white residue on the tub which is a nuisance to rinse out . And the next day when I get in the shower , the bath mat is dangerously slippery due to the `` coating '' from the conditioner . As a result , I have to constantly launder the bath mat in the washing machine , with strong detergent . On the plus side , I like the fragrance . However , this product is just not worth the hassle - or the safety risk - of using it . Unless you condition your hair in the sink , I would be wary of purchasing Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Conditioner .	-1
The first thing I noticed about the Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Conditioner was the sweet berry-like fragrance that I found very pleasing . I followed the directions ( comb in and leave on 3 minutes - rinse ) and used it along with theNexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo , 13.5 Ounce , ( as recommended ) . I found that my hair did feel softer but it seemed to be weighed down and lacking the volume that I get usingPantene Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy Conditioner 8.4 Fl OzI discovered that my hair ended up greasy looking by the next morning , creating a demand that I have to wash it every day . I tried using less of the conditioner and rinsing more , but after a week of using it with no change , I 'm really not pleased with the results . My almost 50 year old hair is fine and thinning , so I need all the help I can get . What this conditioner promises is not what it delivers .	-1
Having had luck with Nexxus in the past , I jumped at the chance to give this product a try . The first time I used it , my hair was definitely a bit softer , easier to get my comb through , a little shinier , and seemed to have a decent amount of volume and bounce.Subsequent usage of the conditioner did n't exactly return those same results . Each time - and I have to admit that I do n't know what caused some of this - the volume decreased and my hair started to become more and more tangled . The latter was especially odd to me , because aside from a stray tangle every now and then , that 's never really been a problem for me . After using this conditioner several times , though , my hair started to develop actual knots that required a fair amount of time and care to comb through . I 've never had that happen with a conditioner before , but I feel like I can attribute it to this one because after I switched back to the conditioner that I had been using before this experiment , the problem disappeared ( the same held true when I tried another couple of brands , as well ) .As for the decreasing volume , it came as a surprise because , as other reviewers have noted , the conditioner is light and its consistency is not as creamy as I had originally expected it to be . I do n't know if the product left some kind of build-up on my hair or what , but just like with the tangling issue , once I stopped using this conditioner , the volume returned.Further , I have to add that even though other Nexxus products have n't affected me this way , this conditioner resulted in some pretty heavy-duty breakouts - I rinsed my hair thoroughly ( and then some ) each and every time , but after each subsequent use , I noticed more breakouts on not only my face , but also on my neck , shoulders , and back . Again , all of that cleared up once I stopped using the product.To be completely fair , it could very well be that there 's just some chemical in the conditioner that I have an allergy to , so the things mentioned above might not happen to others who use this . I can add , though , that my mother also gave this a try and noted immediately that it made her hair flat.So , based on my experience ( and my mother 's ) , this product just is n't for me . The first time I used it , I was impressed . . . I just do n't know what happened after that . Pretty much all of the other reviews of this have been largely positive , so my less-than-good results might just have been an isolated occurrence . I would caution people with sensitive skin ( and also those who are not keen on strong fragrances because that , too , is an issue here ) to maybe research this a little more before giving it a try . Again , lots of people seem to like this a lot , so the odds seem to be pretty good that people who give this a try will be glad that they did - I just wish that I was one of them .	-1
For a product claiming to be weightless , I found this to be a very thick and heavy conditioner , not light at all . As a conditioner , it did n't `` condition '' my hair . I 've used many conditioners in my time , and this is one I 'd stick with the cheaper , dollar type conditioners . My hair style is more difficult , thick , curly and frizzy , but even VO5 works better than this , though I 'm usually a Pantene/Aussie girl . Not recommended .	-1
I was really let down by this conditioner . I usually just love Nexxus hair products . I had just used a shampoo that smelled 'Oh so good ' , and I reached for the bottle of conditioner , opened it , and thought 'Ewwwwww [ ... ] It smelled a bit like , if maybe I spread half rotted fruit on my body and ran a marathon . Luckily it is n't a strong scent - if it had been , I would have just tossed it right then and there . It 's a very light , fruity , sweaty rotten smell to me.The conditioner itself was fine . My medium texture , wavy hair soaked it up - it 's a bit thin ... but really it reminded me of some very cheap conditioners- you know the kind that 'knocks off ' the big names but only cost a couple of dollars ? It 's about like that . It does work ok as a conditioner , and my hair was soft afterwards and fairly manageable but nothing to really rave about . I 've definitely used better Nexxus conditioners though , and the $ 2 less expensive brand smells a lot better.I was really disappointed in this product .	-1
This conditioner is fairly expensive and I 've found better out there for less . It left my hair very soft , but very dull . It 's does n't leave a residue that I can tell b/c my hair feels soft & not weighed down . I 've used it a few times with different shampoos and the result is always the same : soft , dull hair.I think other product names might get removed , but I reviewed another condition that works way better for my hair type ( wavy , fine that I blow dry & flat iron every day ) that I 'd recommend .	-1
It 's been a long time since I used Nexxus products , so I was curious how they are as of lately . I must say I was highly disappointed with this conditioner.First of all , the smell ... is awful . I do not even know how to describe it - it is a putrid yet somewhat sweet smell and not sweet in a good way , it is a rotten sort of sweet ... like vomit . I have never smelled a hair product , or any other product , like this . Just bad . It 's not floral , it 's not sweet like candy or fruit , not herbally.. just rotten or spoiled , like vomit type of smell.Despite the smell , I proceed to apply it to my hair . I used tons of it and it still was no good at conditioning/detangling . I used A LOT of it and ended up having to add my usual conditioner on top of it , to detangle my hair and get a conditioned feel . My hair is waist length and curly/wavy . I comb it through with a wide tooth comb when I put the conditioner in , so I can definitely tell whether it detangles well or not , right away.This conditioner might be ok for someone with short and/or straight ( and thin ? ) hair , but it was not good at all for me .	-1
This conditioner does what a conditioner is supposed to do : it makes your hair soft and smooth . However , the scent is really strong and harsh . I had to wash it off my hair almost immediately because I could n't stand the scent any longer .	-1
The scent for this conitioner was n't the best , I 've used Nexxus products before & they always seem to just do a okay job . This conditioner just did n't work for my long colored hair . It did n't cut the tangles out , this would probably be great for thin hair or shorter hair .	-1
I used the Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Conditioner along with theNexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Shampoo , 13.5 Ounce ( as recommended ) , and found that my hair did feel nicer and softer but it also became weighed down and greasy looking by the end of the evening ( not even 14 hours after washing ! ) . I tried using less and rinsing more ( just in case ) but after a week of using with no change in results , I 'm really not pleased or impressed . My almost 50 year old hair is fine and thinning , so when this happens , it really looks awful , making this a conditioner I wo n't be using or recommending .	-1
As described on the bottle and product description , this leave-in conditioner is intended for people that want to add volume . It adds 85 % more volume without weighing hair down . My hair has a Keratin straighter in it , which means it is naturally curly but chemically straighten and has about 95 % of the curl removed . Occasionally I want to add some volume and height to my hair for certain styles and thought Nexxus Hydralight would be the answer , sadly it left my hair a greasy mess . If you have tried foam-in hair colors and you know how it leaves your hair looking like straw ? Well imagine greasy looking straw , that is what my hair looked like . Hey but it smells great ! Maybe it is just my hair type . I have dry coarse hair . Maybe this is more suitable for thin normal hair . Is it intended as a styling product ? Too many variables and questions - this is not for me .	-1
Typically I think of Nexxus as having high quality , albeit it often expensive , products . This `` leave in '' conditioner is a small bottle , just 5.5 ounces in the container , but it costs about $ 13 . At that price , I would expect superior performance . However , this conditioner is average , at best.The ingredients are : water ( Aqua ) , Glycerin , PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil , Polyquaternium-4 , Cocamidopropyl Betaine , Polyquaternium-11 , Fragrance ( Parfum ) , DMDM Hydantoin , Sodium Chloride , Disodium EDTA , Hydrogenated Coconut Oil , Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate , Propylene Glycol , Ascorbic Acid , Tocopheryl Acetate , Panthenol , Sea Salt , Red 33 , and Blue # 1.The directions say for damp hair , apply 1 to 2 pumps to your palm , rub hands together and evenly distribute through hair . You may also apply it to dry hair , using just half a pump.I tried it both ways , and used half of what was suggested . I still found that it made my hair a little greasy . My hair is light , and fine , so I also had other members of the household try it , and they felt the same way , even though they had thicker and drier hair naturally.For me , this product was very average and just not worth the high price .	-1
This is foam leave-in conditioner has a nice , light , pleasant scent . You apply this conditioner to damp hair and then style as usual . It is lightweight and does not weigh my hair down at all , which is good , but it made my hair dry.On the other hand , you can also use this on dry hair to control fly-away hairs and static . That worked for me , but overall , this is not a great product for my hair . ( I have dry , curly , color-treated hair )	-1
I have naturally curly hair . My hair is not dry or oily . ( I use products for `` normal '' or `` thick '' hair types . ) My hair is thick and long . This means that I use between 2 and 3 bottles of conditioner for every 1 bottle of shampoo . When I received a bottle of Nexxus Hydralight Weighless Moisture Leave-In Conditioning Foam I was excited . I thought this would replace all those bottles of conditioner . However , no matter how I use this product I am disappointed . `` Moisture '' must be another word for greasy or oily . I tried using this product after shampooing , with my hair still wet and no bottle conditioner . I tried after shampooing and using conditioner . I even tried on already dry hair . All gave the same result : flattened , greasy hair . Each time , I had to shampoo twice to get all the grease out.This product does nothing about tangling . But then again , the bottle never claimed to help with snares.Of all the products I 've tried , Pantene is still the best conditioner out there.Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews .	-1
For the record I have thick and wavy , shoulder-length hair that is on the dry side at this time , but not horribly so that it 's like straw . So I was looking forward to tryingNexxus ' Hydralight Weightless Moisture Leave-In Conditioning Foam , 5.5 Ounce . Too bad I ended up disappointed . I tried it a few different ways ( wet , dry , with a hair dryer ) and was less than impressed each time . At first I used the amount recommended in the directions , but it was too much and I kept decreasing the amount while I tried in vain to get it work with my hair one way or another . All it did was make my hair look oily-shiny and I 'd still have fly-aways . We 're not talking healthy-shiny either , this was the gross , unwashed-for-two-weeks greasy look . Ugh ! At first it was n't so bad and was fairly weightless as it claims on the bottle , but pretty soon it started weighing my hair down and gave me that lovely greaseball look we women all strive for . If I kept using this , I 'd have to wash my hair every day if not more , and probably my pillowcase too . I wash my hair every other day because it keeps my hair healthier that way and am unwilling to change that . While I do n't recommend this , apparently it has worked for others , so take my opinion with a grain of salt . Although I would recommend trying to get it on sale and/or with a coupon if you 're interested , otherwise , I think it 's a waste of money and am glad I got to try it for free . Mine 's getting pitched .	-1
The # 2 Stars are because it did absolutely nothing on my 4a-4b Natural hair however due to the lightness and foaminess of this product I believe it would work just lovely on Natural hair that has been straightened for a week or on relaxed & Caucasian hair .	-1
I guess this entire line of products just is n't for me . It got such glowing reviews from two other reviewers , but this product just makes my hair heavy and greasy . I normally only put conditioner on the dry , split ends of my hair ( regular conditioners tend to be heavy , they do n't claim to be & # 34 ; weightless & # 34 ; like this product does ) but this product does claim to be weightless ... ..well , I beg to differ on that . Sure , I could use it on just the ends , but why would I spend this kind of money for a product that makes such bold claims about its weightlessness ? I guess it works for thicker , drier hair but it does absolutely nothing good for my normal , fine hair . I 'll stick with the $ .99 bottle of Suave I guess .	-1
I used and liked both the shampoo and conditioner in this same Nexxus weightless product line . The conditioner is the first one that truly does n't weigh down my thin textured , long hair . Because I was pleased with the other items I 'd tried in the product line , I hoped the leave-in conditioner would also be terrific . It wasn't.The instructions state to use the product on damp hair , after first shampooing and conditioning . Direction details are half a pump to use as a way to manage flyaway 's and frizz , and two pumps as a leave in conditioner . I first tried half a pump and blew dry my hair . That quantity did n't weigh down my hair but also did n't do a great job controlling frizz . The small quantity of Bio-Sil that I previously used for that task works far better.Next I tried two pumps as a leave in conditioner and found my hair was weighed down - felt heavy and looked flat . Given the thin texture of my hair I decided that perhaps two pumps worked for thick textured hair , and perhaps by reducing the quantity I 'd be happy with the results . So , next I used a little more than one pump and even that seemed to be too much . At that point , I lost patience trying to figure out the right quantity -- something that should be stone cold simple . I do n't have time to waste toying with the product -- so , I am underwhelmed and disappointed.The shampoo and rinse-out conditioner are definitely products I will continue to use , but this leave-in conditioner fell short .	-1
I have thick hair . Some days I only have time to wash my hair ( I have kids ) , and do n't have a chance to use conditioner because of the time it takes to rinse it out . I 've been using the Body Shops GRAPESEED GLOSSING SERUM , seriously folks , if you want something that really works this is it ! It 's a small bottle but so far it 's lasted me 4-5 months because it does n't take much to get results . Anyway , back to the product that does n't work : Nexxus is horrible ! First , it pumps out like hair mouse and for a moment I thought that is what I was putting in my hair . The first time I tried it my hair was still wet/damp . I rubbed in 2 pumps of Nexxus Hydralight and felt like it was too thick , like hair gel . After my hair dried my hair felt horribly heavy - no bounce or shine - it looked like I had n't washed my hair in weeks . I decided to try again the next day , same results . I wanted to wash it out but did n't have time , so I tied back my hair in a ponytail , which I hate , and then later wore a hat . The natural fullness Nexxus claims comes out as HEAVY and greasy - but for me , not that it looked so greasy , but that it felt greasy . My hair did n't bounce or relax , it was just stiff and clumpy.I really wanted this product to work so I could go between using the Grapeseed Glossing Serum and Nexxus , but I do n't ever want to use Nexxus again .	-1
I discovered Nexxus shampoo and conditioner last year when it was on sale in Costco . It was love at first use and there 's been no going back , so I really expected to like this product more . I have fine , very wavy hair and a lot of it . I just could n't seem to use the right amount of this stuff to get the results others have . When I used too little I got staticy , flyaway hair , too much and my hair was too weighed down and dull . It was very frustrating and I had to stop using it . I will continue to use Nexxus other products , but this stuff just does n't work for me .	-1
This is the first time I 've tried a Nexxus product and eh , it was ok . I used it in combination with the hydralight shampoo ( Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Shampoo , 13.5 Ounce ) for 2+ weeks . This review combines them both , as I always used them together.I 've tried several hair products in the past , but I 've never been impressed enough to switch from using my regular 2-in-1 from Suave.Anyway , I did n't really notice much difference in my hair , except for reduction of static ! Now , was it the shampoo ... or conditioner ... or the weather ? The weather has been changing , and I usually only have a terrible problem with static during the winter . Hard to say ... ? I focused on my ends when applying the conditioner . It , too , was ok , but I did n't notice much , if any , difference in my hair for the extra step of work it took me . I always think foam conditioners are hard to apply evenly . Globs in one area , nothing in the next ... The scent of the shampoo was n't my favorite . It was more floral than I prefer . When lathering , I got a quick burst of citrus , but a flowery smell is the prominent scent . Thankfully , it was light and did n't linger on my hair . Well , a very slight clean floral smell , but not like some shampoos where every time you turn your head , you get a huge whiff of your shampoo all.day.long . So , it was ok , but I personally would n't buy this shampoo for its scent . The conditioner also had a similar floral smell.I think hair care products are hard to accurately review as everyone 's hair is different , so results will vary from best-ever to worst-ever ! Also , scent is a very subjective matter ! What I hate , you 'll love ... and vice versa ! So , you 'll just have to try it yourself - you may love it ! For me , it 's back to good ol ' Suave .	-1
I really wanted to love this leave-in conditioning foam . I like products that make hair care easier and make my hair feel better . While this conditioner was easy to use , I did n't like the results . It made my hair feel odd , almost rough in texture . That surprised me . I used it along with other Nexxus Hydralight products , as instructed , but it just did n't make my hair feel good . I 'll stick with other Nexxus products , but I wo n't continue using the leave-in conditioner . On the positive side , it smells good .	-1
I purchased a completely line of Nexxus products for a big presentation I was giving in Las Vegas . Shampoo , condition , styling products , and this foam conditioner . I chose the foam conditioner because I thought my hair would need it in the dry desert air . I was n't impressed with these new lines at all.I have to admit , I was disappointed . I did n't feel my hair was weightless and there were still a lot of frizzies by midday . I did n't feel like I was using a high quality product . I have very dry thin hair .	-1
That was the first thing I noticed - the smell - not a fragrance I like or can use with my allergy/respiratory problems.I did try to use it on my hair while it was dry - not a good look ! ! My hair is shoulder length , thick and color treated and has a wonderful , healthy shine.After applying the Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Leave-in Conditioning Foam ( I found none of that to be true on my hair ) , my hair was dull and heavy feeling and just plain dirty looking.I washed it immediately and will not use this particular type of Nexxus product again . I 'll stick to the original formula and the Youth Renewal line - both of which I really like !	-1
If only every pretty book cover had a wonderful book inside . Nexxus Hydra-light shampoo has one of the prettiest , best designed bottles I 've seen in a long time . The top is thin and perfect for smaller hands to pick it up . The blue color is a little bit of sky blue heaven in the bathroom . Ah but that color gives away a little fault in the beauty , there is a little bit of gray skies in there.Sitting on the shelf , this would be the perfect impulse buy . Ah if only the shampoo were as beautiful as the bottle . The bottle says weightless moisture . I would expect that to make my hair soft and full of ... moisture . Instead it sucked all the moisture right out of my hair , making it hard to style . I have thick hair and this did me no favors . The smell might work for some ; it is a bit too fruity for my taste . Kind of smells like the perfume people that use a pole wear . Not a sophisticated smell.Too bad , the bottle held so much promise . If only the contents were as beautiful as the cover .	-1
Nexus says it 's weightless moisturizer shampoo will `` Keep ( s ) hair feeling fresh , revived and voluminous without added weight . '' And does it ? Uh no , at least not in my case.Shampoos can vary and so long as it scrubs up and such it is doing its job but that having been said you can get one for a lot less than the $ 9+ price tag this carries to do the same work . After using it a few times my hair was not particularly `` voluminous , '' in fact it seemed limper and flatter than normal and the shampoo itself was the only thing I 'd changed from my usual routine.Add to that my wife said that my hair had a scent of cedar after using this . Luckily she likes cedar but I do n't think you want a shampoo to ` surprise ' you by added its own scent to whatever you are planning , without letting you know it is doing it.So over all , it did lather up and it did clean my hair but it added its own perfume to the proceedings and it certainly seemed to fail at its promise to add volume and revivification to my hair . Add to that the higher price tag compared to other shampoos that will perform at this level for less and I have to say give this a pass .	-1
There was nothing in the description stating that this shampoo was for any particular hair type , but it is definitely not for fine hair . The description states that it does n't weigh hair down , but it certainly did weigh mine down . I have had very good luck with Nexxus products in the past , but this particular shampoo just does n't do anything for me . My hair feels almost greasy and it was difficult to style after using this shampoo . So , while this shampoo would probably work for a lot of people , if you have normal or fine hair , you may want to reconsider purchasing this one . It does smell nice , though .	-1
I rolled the dice on Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Shampoo and almost came up with snake eyes . The shampoo has a pleasant aroma to be sure and it did moisturize well . I ca n't complain about the way my hair -- admittedly short since I had a haircut a week before trying this -- looks . But this is supposed to be a light , weightless shampoo and my hair feels extremely heavy after trying it . I 'm sure there is a niche market for this product but , especially at $ 10 a bottle , I honestly ca n't recommend it.I was given a free sample through the Vine program in exchange for an honest review .	-1
I ca n't say I noticed a difference with this shampoo though I do want to mention I tried it twice and do n't know if it 's a coincidence that my hair sure seemed to get dirtier faster afterward . I think of Nexxus products as being good ones but this one did not impress me at all . It did go on easy and make a nice lather but it did n't feel particularly moisturized after .	-1
This is the first time I 've tried a Nexxus product and eh , it was ok . I used it in combination with the leave-in conditioner ( Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Leave-In Conditioning Foam , 5.5 Ounce ) for 2+ weeks . This review combines them both , as I always used them together.I 've tried several hair products in the past , but I 've never been impressed enough to switch from using my regular 2-in-1 from Suave.Anyway , I did n't really notice much difference in my hair , except for reduction of static ! Now , was it the shampoo ... or conditioner ... or the weather ? The weather has been changing , and I usually only have a terrible problem with static during the winter . Hard to say ... ? I focused on my ends when applying the conditioner . It , too , was ok , but I did n't notice much , if any , difference in my hair for the extra step of work it took me . I always think foam conditioners are hard to apply evenly . Globs in one area , nothing in the next ... The scent of the shampoo was n't my favorite . It was more floral than I prefer . When lathering , I got a quick burst of citrus , but a flowery smell is the prominent scent . Thankfully , it was light and did n't linger on my hair .

This Nexxus shampoo says it is weightless moisture , leaving hair revitalized and voluminous . It left my hair feeling as if it was n't clean with no volume at all . My bangs do not even look as if the hair has been washed . My hair is about 8 '' below my shoulders and the shampoos I have been using have n't even required conditioners . I thought this one would not , especially since the shower floor became slippery as I rinsed it off . I thought at least that means my hair wo n't tangle ; but many of the ends were knotted.The smell is also a very cloying sweet fragrance , not very pleasant in my opinion . This was just not a very successful experience .	-1
I returned the hair dryer . I had nothing against the hair dryer , except I have a disability and it was too heavy for me .	-1
The minute I took this hair dryer out of the box I knew it was gon na be tough for me to give it more then 2 stars ! Seriously ... the cord is so short I could n't plug it in and easily use it for any length of time w/o turning my body towards the outlet to get the other side of my head . I was shocked that the designer of this hairdryer could n't add another 1 1/2 feet to the cord . From there , I felt like this hair dryer was just another ploy for someone to purchase yet another gadget to dry their hair and keep the curl . A simple attachment to your current hairdryer would do the job . I found this hairdryer to not do any better then my current hairdryer w/ the attachment . Waste of time and space in the bathroom drawer is my thought ! Pass ... .	-1
I was really looking for a diffuser to use with curly hair . This blows so strong even on the low setting that it 's really just a flat hair dryer.You can not use it to & # 34 ; scrunch dry & # 34 ; curly hair , because any hair near it will be immediately sucked in to the fan and ripped out of your head.This is a big disappointment	-1
This seemed like a really great idea , and I love how light it is in comparison to the two blowdryers I currently use ( a Sedu Revolution and aInifiniti by Conair 228 Nano Silver Tourmaline Ceramic Styler , White ) , but it does n't work well for my hair.First of all , if you have curly or wavy hair , you know that a blow dryer that blows the hair around causes frizz . A deep bowl diffuser will usually cup the hair so that it does n't move too much . This Conair dryer puts out too much air , even on the low setting , so that your hair gets blown about , and gets frizzier and frizzier . I 've tried it both with and without the extra attachment , and have had the same problem each time.The second main problem is that the attachment does n't hold your hair if it 's long . The two other diffusers I have create enough depth for me to place my mid-back hair in them to dry . The Conair one would work great if you had shorter hair that is perhaps above your shoulders , but for longer hair , it just does n't work as well as a regular dryer.On the positive side , as I mentioned above , it is lightweight , and it has two settings : high and low . It also has a cold shot button so you can lock in your style.It 's a good idea in theory , but just does n't work as well in practice.UPDATE ON 4-30-14 : For the last few months , I 've been using theDevaCurl DevaFuser Hair Dryer Diffuseras my diffuser , and I love it ! It leaves my curls frizz-free , and dries them pretty quickly . It 's also come down in price since it first came out . I 'd definitely recommend the DevaFuser over this !	-1
Sorry , but this just did not work for me . I wasted $ 25.00 for ZIP ! If I have to go on a diet with just 500 to 800 calories a day , this supplement just is n't worth the money.If a person is going to eat 500-800 calories a day , they may as well just take some less expensive over-the-counter vitamins ( as supplements ) which will probably help to supplement the individual more completely than & # 34 ; 1234 & # 34 ; .This product DID NOT curb my appetite ... It basically did nothing.I have no side-effects from & # 34 ; 1234 & # 34 ; , but also , no results .	-1
I really wanted this to work . First , it burned when I placed it under my tongue . Is that normal ? I tolerated it though and held it there anywhere from 45 seconds to two minutes . It did n't suppress my appetite , which is really what I was looking for . I 'm told after the fact , these drops are different in that they DO N'T contain any hcg , yet this is in the exact same type of package and promotes itself as such . I guess if you do n't pay attention and end up missing the crucial three letters ( hcg ) on the box , like I did , you 'll end up with a worthless product . I have no doubt the manufacturers know what they are doing by changing the product but keeping it in the exact same packaging . Anyway , it did n't suppress my appetite and I did n't lose any weight .	-1
Very dissapointed in this brand , as I have tried other HCG brands that had virtually no flavor . I could only tolerate using these drop for about 5 days before stopping . It literally took all I had just to hold these drops under my tongue due to the extremely foul taste and it burned immensely . I feel like I wasted my hard earned money , especially since I purchased 2 boxes !	-1
I 'm up for trying anything new , but these drops are n't worth it , unless you are willing to adhere strictly to the accompanying 800 calorie/day diet . I did n't realize the diet was mandatory when I ordered these , but found out when I read the directions . This calorie deficit basically tells me that they do n't work and that the product is not actually innovative or useful .	-1
I have no idea how people are able to do this . I was on the drops for 6 days and the hunger pain is no joke . I had read reviews where people talked about the hunger pains and said they were n't that bad . Those people are liars and that pain is intense . And the craziest part was that I was doing the 1500 calorie diet so I can only wonder how people who are on the stricter calorie diets stick to it . I gave up and while I might be a quitter , I 'm definitely not hungry . Going to stick to exercise because this was harder than doing an intense work out for an hour .	-1
I have stopped the 1234 diet drops because they were making me extremely fatigue and plus it was hard for me to follow the strict diet but I did lose a few pounds and I 'm sure I could have lost more but I gave up and I 'm just doing the Mega T diet pills which have been a better appetite suppressant than the drops .	-1
I had trouble finding out what exactly it is that I can eat ! I am not able to sit down to a full lunch or supper . I work a 14 hour day ! This diet id way to complex to follow unless you are home all day by yourself w/nothing to do but this horrible starvation diet !	-1
From what I have read online ... and the very label shown here , these contain zero HCG ? ! When you search HCG here , these come up , but if you look at the label they dont contain HCG .	-1
The suggested diet is actually dangerous.It does not supress the normal person 's appetite.I would urge people just to use willpower , watch portions/choices , and walk daily if possible . The weight will eventually come off . Be patient -- be safe .	-1
this is like snake oil i would not recommend this to anyone and i am pretty sure it is does not work at all	-1
I did n't realize these drop we 're not the real HCG drops until I received them . When returning them , it states no refund . Very frustrating , now stuck with $ 32 of something I wo n't use .	-1
This is n't HCG . It did n't really work . The weight I lost was through diet and exercise . I did not lose a pound a day .	-1
this does absolutely nothing it promises to do.although i never followed the 500 cal diet plan which is literally a starvation plan I still expected this to deliver to some extent , maybe surpress my appetite or create a nauseous feeling ... nothing ... I stopped this after 2 weeks cus I just kept eating like normal and put on 2 pounds ... .the best diet pill/drops is some good old fashion diet/exercise/will power	-1
