I like this belt ... the only bad thing I have to say is , the color is slightly more orange-ish than brown . But it was delivered quickly and is really versatile with my wardrobe ! And ca n't beat the price : )	1
Adorable ! This will add accent to any outfit . The one size fits all is not entirely true , but I 'm an 8-10 and it fit fine . If you are a 14+ , this wo n't fit you , not comfortably anyway . Otherwise , this belt is a must have . The butterfly clasp is adorable . I wore it with jeans , a plain Old Navy tee , and a butterfly scarf and got tons of compliments . You can dress it up or down .	1
This color goes with everything , I was expecting it to be a little wider based on the picture , but glad that it is n't .I 'm very happy how it looks and how just enough adds to my outfit , belt fits great and the buckle is easy to work with .Thank you - I 'm very happy with my purchase !	1
I have n't used this yet so I ca n't honestly give it the 5 stars it may deserve . By appearences , it looks well made and fits nice and snug which is what I was looking for . It arrived on , or before , the due date and in good condition . Hope to get a lot of use out of it .	1
the belt fits good it looks good on my girl friend she enjoys have it on it makes the outfits she wheres it with	1
Very nice necklace an bought extra color to match .really worth buying .	1
This would have gotten a five , but the earrings I bought to match this necklace were n't the same color . Wonderful price for though !	1
Love this chain , I bought the earrings first perfect match . I have all the colors , just the best sparkle and bling . Buying some for my sister !	1
it 's not @ yellow as this looks ... it is definately champagne colored and i am very relieved ! dainty and goes w/everything	1
I have this crystal ball in almost every color . Its a little small but once you wear it , it brings a chic touch to your outfit .	1
This is my birthstone color . Purchase the ear rings but they are lighter . I 'm afraid the chain will break because it 's so thin	1
Very Pretty ... Prettier than I thought it would be ... .So far ... .. anything that I have purchased from them ... I have enjoyed and liked ! ! ! Good one Silver Jewelry Forever ! ! !	1
I love Allegra K. Every shirt I have ordered is fabulous . This shirt fit as expected and the fabric and design make the shirt look like a $ 40 - $ 60 shirt . I am more than impressed with this shirt . I received a compliment on it the first day I wore it too .	1
My mom said it reminded her of the star trek outfit and laughed . But To me that was a big compliment cause I love star trek and had n't noticed this shirt bears a small resemblance to the outfits of the enterprise crew , which makes me love it even more.Such a cute shirt . It 's quickly become one of my favorites . And for such a decend price ... yes , please !	1
the sleeves are tight , so forsure go up a size , trust me on this brand , always go up a size . The quality is what you expect for the price , no hidden meaning there .	1
Nice top can be worn to work and great with jeans too . It 's definitely a Junior size medium ... if your a solid medium in misses sizes I would order a large .	1
I really like this shirt ! It is great quality and has held up through normal wash and wear . Great price too ! I love the style and no one else I know has it !	1
When I first bought this item I was afraid that it would be slim fitting . After receiving it I have found this not to be true . The fit was perfect , just what I was wanting and the material is great . I absolutely love this shirt ! -Side note about the shipping , I ordered it early Feb ( maybe the 6th ) and it said it would get to me by March 15 , I actually got it on the 12th of Feb. Alll in all I was happy to get it so quickly and even more so now that I am in love with this shirt !	1
I really love this shirt . I got the mostly black one and I wear it to work at least once a week . Very cute and love the price .	1
I love this sweater , and the price is the best , colors is pretty , fix really good , I recommend it . buy it .	1
Fits perfectly nice and soft im 5 & # 34 ; 8 140 so I ordered a size 8 and it fits great true to size	1
This is a nice material and the right size for me . It like it and it fits perfectly fine for me . Thanks	1
I choose to rate these cloth I want others to know when buying what to expect . The tell you and it is true If . You like cotton material you . Will love this top .	1
I had to order a medium for my granddaughter coz they were out of small , but it was just too big for her so I 'm keeping it for myself ! I still have to lose z few more pounds but I like it !	1
this top arrived earlier than expected and is going to be a gift for my 16 year old daughter . I think it is cute without being too much of anything . The size looks perfect and the quality of the fabric is great . It will be in her wardrobe for this season and I am sure into Spring , too .	1
I got this for my wife and she just loved it , perfect size ... . great quality material and she even used it the following day to go to work .	1
It is a comfortable and cute shirt . I got it in white and I have to wear a tank top underneath it or else it is see through .	1
I fit ok just a tad tight so cant put in dryer . Otherwise the blouse fit well and I like it	1
Ok I ordered this even though there was mixed reviews about the shirt , especially the size but I thought hey , for $ 7 ... It 's actually super cute and the material is soft , does n't feel cheap . I got a medium , i 'm a medium in all shirts and it fits fine , maybe a tiny tight if anything . Overall , i 'm happy with the shirt !	1
The shirt is cheap all around including the material which is a little transparent , but it 's worth every dollar I paid for it . It looks nice and I can wear it to work for casual Friday .	1
So many do n't fit , but this does and I love it ! Just could n't get other colors in my sizes ... darn , want more .	1
IT WAS PERFECT FOR THE PRICE , THE COLOR ARE REALLY NICE , I LOVE SWETERS LIKE THIS AND I LIKE FOR THE MODEL	1
I like the fabric of this top and the fit.It fits to perfection and also is true to size ! I like the pattern as it is different and makes a wardrobe top ! Not to thick and to thin of Fabric as it is well made and looksattractive ..I did receive quite a few complements on this simplecotton shirt .	1
IT WAS TOO BIG BUT I LOVE HOW IT 'S MADE	1
I like it , nice combination of colors , which is expected according to the price and the description of the product , good quality finishes , is nice , good size , I liked the color and texture , the shipping was fast .	1
This top is so nice and casual . It goes great with skinny jeans and riding boots for a comfortable casual look !	1
material is sturdy and soft looks just like picture im 5ft about 110 ibs 34D/F i got a size small this shirts fits just like a casual modest blouse should i read the reviews after i ordered and was really worries because i ordered a small . just order your size the sizing is fine sleeves are not tight for me	1
Very comfortable shirt , exactly what I expected . Can be worn with shorts and a belt or jeans and a cute scarf .	1
Different from other tops I have bought from them , this one fits great ! Have worn it with trousers , jeans etc.. Use a nice accessory and will look good .	1
was satisfied with my purchase as I have a weakness for stripes . it was soft and comfortable . Am looking forward to wearing it .	1
I 'm 5'2 and 130 lbs . I got a medium and it fits perfectly . I does n't come with washing instructions of any kind . I washed it in cold and air dried it , but it feels like the fabric is only going to hold up to so many washings before its too pilly to wear . I 've only washed it twice so far , so I could still be pleasantly surprised .	1
I bought this shirt in a medium size . I recommend getting a size larger than normal with this shirt . I wish I would have ordered a large . I may ask to have them ship a large one . But as for the design it is beautiful and the packaging is phenomonal !	1
Really love the style and fit of this shirt . Exactly what I was hoping for ! Would definitely recommend . ( Husband agrees . )	1
So cute and fits great . This shirt is very comfortable and you wear it as casual or professional/casual if you mix it up right .	1
it 's quality fabric , well- made , and soft and comfortable ! No complaints here ! it also came quickly and is holding up well with washes !	1
It looks like the picture . It is a little thin comparatively but it is still a nice shirt and for the price it is a good buy . I am happy with it . it came quickly and was packaged appropriately .	1
REALLY FEMININE STYLING ON THIS PETITE SHIRT WAS A GIFT FOR A LITTLE PERSON IN MY FAMILY SHE GOT THIS AND SOME BRACELETS I GOT FROM AMAZON ALSO SHE LOVES IT WEARS IT ALMOST EVERY WEEK WITH SOMETHINGLIKES THE WEAR AND WASH FOR A SOFT TOP FOR WINTER AMAZON ROCKS ! ! !	1
Its beautiful , and fitted , but mine is a little big . I think it had sizing so I went a bit up , but I do n't know . Overall the size comes as small to meduim and I 'm usually a petite . I hope that helps . My sister has one as well it looks amazing on her , but me I 'm thinking I 'll have to give it my boyish flare to have it look stunning ahaha . I 'm not very feminine most of the time , so overall its a great buy . Just be sure that you get the right sizing for you . Whatever you pick that 's normal it 'll be a tad over that.The material is stretchy too , and comfortable , I did n't feel as if I 'd sweat in it , but it would keep me warm in the chill .	1
I bought this shirt in black and white , I love both , they fit great and are so comfortable ! I would highly recommend them . The white one is somewhat see through .	1
I like this top but it is a little smaller than I expected . The shirt is comfortable and I like the fit , but if you would like it to fit like it does in the picture you may consider purchasing one size larger than typical .	1
I love the look of this shirt but the sleeves were a bit snug . I can wear it as is OR I may snip off a bit of the sleeves . It will look great as a short-sleeve shirt	1
This shirt is very cute and for the money a super deal . Ca n't beat $ 7.50 for a top this cute . It does run a little small so I am glad I listened to the reviews and ordered a medium . I am normally a small but the medium fits perfectly , Definetly order a size up on this .	1
I have purchased several Allegra K items and this is one of my top 5 favs . It fits absolutely perfect and the quality is outstanding . Very flattering and works for both office and date night . I am 5'4 and is a great length . I highly recommend . I do recommend , however , with all Alkegra K items to wash in cold water and hang to dry . Wearing thus , I immediately look 10 pounds lighter . It so flattering and fits beautifully . I am now going to order the white one since I love this one so much ! !	1
I like the style of the Allegra products , but be warned they run a bit small and tend to be fitted . The fabric on this is very nice , though .	1
Simple and easy . Looks pretty with any jean or short . Material is ok , but I use it for shopping or informal occasions .	1
Got mine in 15 days . Love it so much . I got a small . I 'm about 5'3 & # 34 ; . Fits perfectly . The shirt fits about a b cup bra .	1
This is just what the dr. ordered for my oldest daughter 's birthday . I know she will just love this as green is her color .	1
This is one of the prettiest pendants I have ever seen worn on the skin . The sparkle will put your eyes out . Just beautiful !	1
The necklace is so simple but pretty , in a very nice bag , the person getting it will be so pleased	1
Absolutely beautiful ! ! The color and sparkle on this pendant is amazing , so glad I got it . Will tell a friend ! !	1
Bought this because I have a pink one everyone always compliments . It 's pretty but not as nice as the pink . The little chain is sweet and delicate and it 's precious .	1
I ordered this for a friend of mine at work and she absolutely loved it . Green is her favorite color .	1
This necklace is even more beautiful in real life that it was in the photo.I do not like any more words .	1
Beautiful ... ... ... ... .I Love All there products so far ... .. Did it again ... ..Silver Jewelry Forever ! ! ! I have enjoyed all their products ... ... ..Very colorful ...	1
I love this shirt . It looks great with leggings and my brown riding boots . Is just long enough to cover without looking like a dress .	1
i 'm not normally an animal print kind of girl , and i though that the pattern stopping near the elbow might be weird , but it 's actually a great shirt.first , i love the length . it 's long without looking like a dress . second , i love the dolman sleeves ( loose until around the elbows ) . third , i buy a lot of allegra k products , and they seem to be hit or miss . this one is a hit based on the fabric alone . it 's soft and has n't pilled after many washes .	1
I am short and chunky and this shirt is huge on me . I 'm glad that I ordered from this company . I was n't so sure because the first batwing sweater I got was a little cheaply made but I wore it to work and got complimented by my hot boss . This is not sweater material and it does n't look cheap .	1
I am 5'5 122 lbs this shirt is the perfect oversize fit ! Cant wait for fall weather to wear it ! Recommend this company..great price for unique clothing !	1
I love this top . It looks so good . everyone is wondering where I got this . I wear it with jeans end legends .	1
This top is really made very well and runs true to size . After I read some of the reviews I ordered a Large , dumb move very big . Do not order up order your true size . It will look so cute with leggings and my leopard boots . Anyway , I will keep it regardless of size . The material is nice and thick .	1
Oversized and super comfortable . Nice quality too . Perfect for errands on my days off ! ! Very satisfied with All my Allegra K purchases so far .	1
Soft & comfy . I ordered a large , when I usually get a medium , and it first perfectly . I really like that the leopard print material is sheer too . Sometimes tunics can end up looking too frumpy , but this one looks good !	1
I 'm 5'8 & # 34 ; and 120lbs . I would normally order a size small , but after reading other reviews , I ordered a medium . I could have still gone with a small ! ! ! ! It is really big , but I still like it . The length of the top is almost long enough for me to wear as a dress . I wear it with skinny jeans/pants , with one edge tucked in , and it looks cute .	1
Havent worn it yet but of the 3-4 items that I bought from this Seller , this is the only one that is true to size . Really cute with yoga pants and boots .	1
This tunic is very nice however it is not an off the shoulder top as it appears in the photo . Color is nice and the fabric is soft . I enjoy wearing it . I ordered a couple of sizes up and wear it with leggings . Cute .	1
I love this top ! It is so great that I ordered a second one & # 128515 ; . It looks great with leggings . I 've even bought boots to go with it .	1
Like the top and get a lot of compliments on it but it is cheaply made . Many repairs to date . Seams come undone easily due to improper stitching .	1
This sweater is long enough to wear with leggings and is super cozy . It fits a tad too big , but I like how it is loose fitting . Received many complements on it and had to give out this link to a friend so she could purchase it as well .	1
Came fast . It looks great belted or not . Wore it and got lots of compliments . The price was right and the look is fabulous.defiantly would buy again .	1
Its nice in black-runs LARGE ! Love that though-tie the side up and the way I go-off the shoulder and sexy-nice top !	1
I just received this shirt today . I ordered it in a XL because the last time I bought a shirt from this seller it was too small . I still love it ! It does fall off the shoulder like it does in the picture but its still really nice . I 'll be buying more from this seller : D	1
Love this tunic . I was hoping for to be long and it is , perfect for leggings . The sleeves are long enough that it goes over my rist . I am 5'8 got the XL material is soft and is like a t shirt material and this tunic is a very loose fitting kind of tunic , but you could wear a belt at the waist and it would still look great .	1
I 'm 5'11 180 lbs , DD cup 36-28-40 I am a US size 12 but because of previous reviews as well as my height I ordered the XL/US 16 . It fits me really loosely in the body and length even reaches me mid-thigh . Great with a pair of skinny jeans or leggings and some boots . If Allegra K sells other shirts similarly made then I will definitely be buying again in the future .	1
I love this top , it looks like the picture , which I think is what we are all hoping for . The material is soft and the quality much nicer than expected . I love the diversity of this brand and will definitely be buying more in the future .	1
I 'm a leopard Kind of girls so when I saw This I knew I Would love It . Since I Bought it I 've Worn It a couple Of times and still look good . I will recommend it to anyone . I Always Seem To Find A Top That Is Fashionable , Reasonably Price , Looks Good On me . This Company Is Awesome	1
I really really love this top-and I am not one for animal print-but its so flattering once its on ! The ONLY issue I had was it arrive smelling pretty gross . It smelled like an item left in a fire . perfect fit though ! I got a small-i am 5 & # 34 ; 7 and 125 lbs . falls to mid thigh . A def success !	1
I am 5'11 & # 34 ; , 170lbs , and a size 14 , so I ordered this shirt in XL . This shirt was a little large , but I like my clothes on the loose side and it was expected since its a size 16 . The sleeves kind of have to be twisted for the animal print to show correctly , but other than that it is a very cute top . I was hoping for it to be long enough to just wear with leggings , and it does cover to the bottom of my butt , however I 'd still wear solid leggings/pants under it for when I bend over . All in all , I , happy with this brand of clothing , especially for the price ! : )	1
love this shirt , flowy and perfect for just everyday wear ! the leopard is sheer which I do n't think it said in the description	1
Great product . I was pleased with the look and overall design of the top . It was true to size as I expected with an oversized shirt	1
Fits great and will go with either brown or black leggings . Also have a circle scarf that matches it perfectly !	1
This shirt is AMAZING . I got it in XL and was surprised at how lose it was ! It is perfect with leggings , and is very comfy . I was iffy on the price , but it arrived quickly and I love it .	1
For what I paid this sweater is a great buy if fits great and looks even better on . Like I paid more this one was a hit for sure	1
It came before the time it said it would get here which I loved . It does n't come as is shown on the picture of being able to use it off the shoulder but is still a very cute top . The material is good and the fit is great , very comfortable top but still very cute to wear out which is what I look for when I buy shirts . Overall great buy : )	1
They fit my arm nicely and I think they are pretty well made for the price . Stay away from velcro though cause it can easily snag the fabric and mess them up haha .	1
These are the first ones I 've bought that go past the elbows & # 34 ; naturally. & # 34 ; I love the fit and how I can put them with quite a few of my shirts .	1
These gloves stay on but the palm area is a little tight on me and I ca n't stand to wear them for more than an hour before my knuckles hurt . I usually wear a size L gloves . Also , the length is only 12 & # 34 ; Material is soft and does not itch . I like them but they are not the length shown in the picture , which I knew from reading previous reviews .	1
I bought these gloves because of the extra long length . I have long arms and it takes a lot of tugging to get them up to my elbows . They have a lot of elastic in them so even though I 've worn/tugged/pulled at them they have not stretched out and keep their shape . This tightness gets a little uncomfortable after awhile , but I like wearing these with three-quarter length sleeves and creating the look that I 'm layering a long sleeve underneath.. Very attractive , I bought a pair for a friend .	1
Loving theses but wish they were longer up to arm this is as seen in picture sort easy fit I love much easier than wearing a bunch of clothes for my run in the cooler days live in Florida but I hate a lot of laying so will get more and others like .	1
I put these on when they came today and I think they look super cool and keep my hands warm up here in Chicago ( Midwest ) !	1
I bought these for my daughter for Christmas . They looked cute on her and kept her arms warm . It arrived promptly and was packaged well .	1
I paint and write a lot and it seems my hands and fingers are always cold , making these activities harder to accomplish . It 's mazing that just by warming my arms and palms , how the heat seems to stay in my fingers.I bought a second pair , I loved them so much . One pair I use for painting ( gets messy sometimes ) and the second pair to look nicer when I 'm doing other things .	1
I love these . Been looking for some everywhere ! And this was exactly what I was looking for . They look great ! ! !	1
Freaking great ! I wore these with my Sakkas red boho style tunic dress/top . Was super cute and kept me warm without fudging up my outfit with a shirt underneath that would look weird at the neckline.A good buy for those who do n't want to bother with undershirts . I 'm short , these went up halfway thru my biceps	1
These are wonderful . I see others complained that they did not fit as pictured . Perhaps is you have larger arms this could be a problem . For me they fit perfect . I am not small but I am not overweight , either . I wish they had them in other colors as I would of bought more of them .	1
these gloves are just what I wanted , something I could wear around the house or outside , plain and comfortable . I love the way they fit and feel .	1
Just received , pretty fast shipping , so glad I bought them . They are a thicker cotton material , got the grey color , the slots for your fingers and thumb are perfect as is the length , came all the way passed my elbow !	1
I wish the shirt was longer in the midriff area , otherwise i love it , though my husband does not like it , says its odd and definitely not his favorite shirt on me , also , the thumb holes are awesome , they just seem to be on the pinky side of where the shirt falls , no big deal , just twist the sleeve a bit , voila !	1
I really like this shirt . It 's funky and comfy . I am a small to medium with shirts that have no arms , so of course , I got my normal Large for an armed shirt . If fit how I figured it would . Lose in the body and fit everywhere else . I do n't use the thumb holes as I really like the length of the arms . Nice and long : ) I am ordering it in white now .	1
I really like this shirt but it runs large . I do n't wear it as much as I would like to because its loose around the neck & your bra straps show . Too much of a hassle to return to China tho .	1
I could live in this shirt . Roomy but not baggy , soft , cozy , and perfect . Worth the wait ! Perfect with jeans for an easy casual outfit .	1
This is also a nice blouse and material that I purchased from this seller . I received a lot of compliments . Have not wash yet but I would recommend hand wash .	1
Material is soft washes well . Colors work well together . Breathable material long at the waistline . Very nice sleeve length is long .	1
shipping was quick . The clothes is nice , but I think I should have ordered a smaller size . It 's good experience though .	1
given some of the reviews , i was n't sure what to expect but figured for the price i 'd take the chance am am very glad i did ! this shirt is a quality cotton blend with a little stretch to it , not too heavy , not at all thin or cheap although the white is somewhat sheer ( tried it on with a pink bra and you could definitely see the color ) . the thumb holes were in the correct places , the fit was just fine ( i did order up a size because asian sizes are smaller and also to compensate for any shrinking during future washes ) . shipped quickly and arrived much sooner than expected . 5 stars well earned ! my first purchase from this seller but it wo n't be my last ; & # 62 ; )	1
This came right around Christmas . Was n't sure if I 'd keep or give to daughter . She saw it and fell in love . Very soft and true to color . Love the color .	1
It was a gift and was received very well ... .. looked perfect.I will get one for myself , and it should also come in white main part of this top , I will get myself both ... really cute for young and oldEdith YourChicagoConnection	1
I love this shirt its so cute and comfy . I always get compliments on all the clothes I buy from Allegra ! I am addicted to your store	1
I love this top . I would buy more from this vendor if it did n't take so long to get them . Took about 3 weeks . This top is cut small so order at least 1 size larger than you do normally . Other than that , it 's great	1
I 'm 5'9 & # 34 ; 170lbs so the XL fit perfect , plus it may shrink when I wash it . Will look good with jeans or leggings .	1
I purchased this shirt in both the olive and ivory . It is very soft , thicker material , and feels very expensive . The price was great and I get so many compliments on it .	1
Nothing negative , really awesome I have to get more I 'm trying to find the words to to compliment this top but is hard so I 'll try to fit perfect , just like I love material truly soft and sturdy we 'll made this ill have for a long time I will get more so I will always have really nice took a little while to get but we 'll worth the wait this is the item you really want in your closet lady 's no matter where you live even in the hottest place it will work I live in Florida .its truly nice . Sweet , ++++++awesome ! this the truth take it from someone who takes pride in my clothing on how I look I like to make a statement all the time when I dress casual and formal . I do try to impress no one but me feeling happy when I walk out the door others just always notice my unusualness . nuff said	1
A large fit just right when I usually wear a small ... the seller sen me another one when the first one got lost in the USPS !	1
I have none of the complaints I have read in some of the other reviews . I did take their suggestions however , and ordered a size up . I typically wear Small but ordered medium and it fits perfectly . I have long arms and the sleeves are the right length and the thumb holes are comfortable and reinforced with a trim . The colors are more beautiful than the picture . The fabric is very soft and just barely heavier than typical t shirt material . It is very unique . I will order more in other colors . Shipped super fast . Was n't expecting it until January 7th but it arrived December 20th . A few loose threads but nothing that affected the quality of the seam work .	1
This unique top is really nice on and sooooo soft in feel . I ordered a L which fit me perfectly . I am a size 10-12 in tops and this size was not too tight nor too small . Sometimes items coming from the orient can be made small . I ordered well . Would recommend to friends . Thank you Amazon !	1
It 's very soft and the fit is almost perfect . It 's made of good quality and I will definitely being buying more .	1
Beautiful fit , sooo soft ! = ) What a surpirse ! And it came alot earlier than expected ! I know people complain maybe they 've seriously seriously improved.The fabric was seriously so soft , like high quality cotton . It even smelled a little sweet , and the fit is so beautiful ! ! I 'm not petite nor obese , I 'm uhh bigger in the chest area . And for the price and unique style , it 's so great , 10 stars ! ! = )	1
I love this top , it looks great and feels better ... ..the products do run small so always go larger , but i absolutely recommend buying this product .	1
I 'm going to start with saying , I purchased about 12 items from this company already-maybe did n't like two of what I ordered and thats because of my personal shape . This shirt is awesome-its so cute and I love the color combo ! At first I was a little disappointed because I had to keep tugging the back of the shirt down-but again , I think thats because I have a bigger butt lol . Im 5 '' 7 , 125 lbs , pretty thin , wide hips , slightly bigger butt . This shirt seriously looks awesome and its super comfy . Arm length is perfect-I have long arms . BUY !	1
can not wait to wear this it is too hot to wear now where i live ( houston ) but I will wear this next fall/winter	1
I have ordered a few things of Allegra K 's and am so impressed . I love this shirt . It 's really soft and comfortable . My measurements are something like 40-34-44 at 5'10 & # 34 ; and the XL fits me well - not tight at all - in fact , this one 's perhaps a tad bit large in body area ( though do n't think a Large would probably cut it ) .I always liked the look of lots of their items , but was afraid they 'd all be & # 34 ; Asian sized & # 34 ; and more petite , but they 're not really , overall . However , the finger holes on this shirt are pretty small - my fingers will fit in them , but they really should be larger . They also seem awkwardly placed . That 's the reason I did n't give this 5 stars ( but I still love the shirt and would repurchase ) .Their items do take a bit longer to arrive , but have always come earlier than expected/estimated for me .	1
This top is really cute in person and well made except the thumb holes in the sleeve are awkwardly placed and the sleeves are a few inches longer than they need to be and I have somewhat longer arms than average .	1
This is a cute shirt and a great value for the price . The material does n't feel super cheap , but it is n't the most comfortable thing in my closet . I 'm definitely happy with the purchase .	1
This is so cute -- sleeves are nice and long and the thumbs holes are darling . It 's warm and snuggly and the neckline is scoop-shaped and feminine . I am a larger woman and would normally order an XL . The XL fits wonderfully and not too small as I was afraid . I love Allegra K .	1
My kids told me I looked like a kid with my thumbs in the sleeves ! It 's plenty long , and you do n't have to put your thumbs in and it still fits great . The ends of the sleeves end up getting dirty faster when you do that anyway .	1
I like this shirt so cute , the sleeves are long , it 's very comfty ... have n't wash it yet to see if it shrunk	1
The shirt is nice , good quality fabric and the design is different , so I really liked it and I recommend it .	1
I love the long sleeves with thumb holes because it is comfy and keeps my arms warm . This tee fits me perfectly in XL ( I 'm size 14/16 ) and the colors are muted and not too bright .	1
The material is very soft and comfortable , but as for the thumb holes - more like pinky holes . They are on the wrong side of the sleeve and in order to use them I have to twist the sleeve around . It 's uncomfortable and looks stupid so I 'm just cuffing them up .	1
Its pretty and soft . It would look much better if i was a little thinner , but it does fit . The thumbholes are slightly off but not so much that its a problem . Besides , i only use them when its cold anyway , otherwise i push the sleeves up . This has remained intact after several washings . I would buy this again . Even if the price was higher .	1
I 've gotten many compliments on it . It 's a nice throw on shirt for those days were you just do n't feel like being constricted in your clothes . It 's comfortable and loose . I 'm very happy with this purchase .	1
I read some of the more unhappy reviews , but decided to get this anyway.I 'm 5'5 and weigh about 100 pounds , and got an xs.This fit me well as far as size goes , and of course , it was a bit short . It went to a little past my butt.I still love it anyway though .	1
I think this shirt is perfect . I have a business casual job , so I 'm able to wear it with slacks or jeans . I 'm 5'1 '' and 130lbs and I bought a small . I think it looks a bit more shapely on me than in the pictures.One of my favorites . Highly recommended.The material is thin , like all of Allegra K 's shirts , but a simple tank underneath is an easy fix .	1
This top is wonderful , comfortable and soft . If you are looking for an extreamy comfortable top and soft . You got it . I wanted a larger top so to be comfortable with this one look no further .	1
I 'm a curvy , American girl . I 've lived in Asia and am aware that their clothes run small . This company , however , is great at making their clothes big enough to fit women with wide hips etc . The material of this shirt is nice , and the quality is good too . I 'm 5 foot 4 , and the length on me is similar to that of the picture , but I usually scrunch it up a big . The sleeves are dolman style to the elbow , and then fitted down the arm ( it looks better scrunched up , like the model in the pic ) .The only ( slight ) negative is that they do n't show you the back . It does n't exactly match the front . It 's mostly brown , from the bottom up to a diagonal line , and then black to the top . Not a big deal , but I wish this company showed more accurate pictures , instead of girls in motion wearing purses .	1
Nice fabric and design . I like the loose armpits so they have room to breathe ! I am petite , 5'3 , and usually wear small or medium . However , I bought this in large so I could wear with leggings . It does not look as long as it does on the model pictured . I would have liked if it was several inches longer . It covers the rear end , but when you lift your arms , your rear is exposed slightly . Still , has a nice , flowing yet feminine fit . Good price and good value .	1
After . Buying from Azamon for the past four years I know what to order and what to expect for all they stuff . is great And this ' top is a great top for the summer it fit loose . The length is great the sleeves fit . just . below . the . elbow perfect color	1
i love it fits very good i tried it on as soon as i got planning to buy more color is perfect also	1
I ordered the extra large and would have been fine with a regular large . The material is a little thin but still nice . I am 5 ' 5 & # 34 ; , pear-shaped ( size M-L on top and jean size 10-12 ) . I have a long torso and short legs in proportion . The length of this item is as shown on the model for me but the bottom is somewhat loose and I would prefer it tighter on the bottom . I wore this with leggings and boots and it was very comfortable . I 'm not brave enough to wear it without leggings but someone else may be able to . I would buy this again , but one size smaller .	1
It 's long , it 's soft and it looks great on . What more could you ask ? The fabric is lightweight and has a lot of stretch . The length is longer and looks great with leggings or skinny jeans . I did order a larger size than what I normally wear . It fits me just right !	1
I am size 16 and this shirt fit well , even coming from Asia . the black stripe does n't go all the way in the back on the bottom , but I love the dolman sleeves and the thigh length tunic . I was going for longer tunic shirts that covered my butt with leggings or jeggings and still had some style and comfort . The material is stretchy and soft and I feel that I can move around comfortably without being as self conscious of my bulges . Yet , I think it will still be a solid piece as I lose weight and it becomes a little baggier . It 's meant to have that casual baggy feel that made it in the 80 's .	1
It fits , but being a tad smaller , it is not as long it 's in the picture , and the bat wings kinda disappear . However I love it , can wear it , would recommend it will buy again from this seller	1
The shirt colors are as shown , though mine might be a bit shorter than the one in the photo . It 's a cute item , but there are loose strings . The quality is n't fantastic ... pretty much on par with the other womens ' shirts I 've purchased from Allegra K. I 've washed this shirt twice , and other than more strings ( I do n't know what they 're holding together , but generally just tie them off and snip off the extra ) , it 's held together well . No holes ; no fabric pulling apart - so far so good !	1
I love this top . It is so cute without making me feel like I 'm restricted in my movement . The fabric is thin without being sheer , but I actually like that because I can wear it in warmer weather .	1
i purchased this item for the 3rd time ... .i receive lots of complimetns.. I gave the first one to my sister , ,she loves it so much ! ! I just ca n't say & # 34 ; NO & # 34 ; .. so I purchased this purple , I got this on S size..and now I 'm waiting for the other brown color to arrive.. I 'm a 5'1 //110 lbs ... I ordered xs/s for this..my fitting size for this item is in between..	1
I ordered a large thinking that since this was coming from Asia , I should order larger than my size.However , this shirt fits as the size posted.It is very warm and soft , covers my butt.Perfect for Spring , Fall , AND Winter wear.Highly recommended .	1
I bought the brown and black one and really love it ! It is very & # 34 ; slouchy & # 34 ; and looks super cute with jeans and boots . I love this top !	1
model is shorter than 5'5 & # 34 ; apparently . so ordering up in size only widens the shirt . just as baggy , but not as long like picture . would be nice if bottom was fitted , but it is more like a tent on me .	1
This top is exactly what they say it is and fit exactly like the model ! ! ! I am very satisfied with this top ! Love it ! ! !	1
I have gotten several of the Allegra K tops . They all run small , so order up . I am a size 8 and to get the right fit , I order large . When you get the right size , they are really cute and inexpensive way to update your leggings .	1
This is a great weekend top ! I 'm 5'5 & # 34 ; 150lbs and I bought an XL , it fits exactly as in the picture except a little shorter . I 'm always looking for tops to wear over leggings on the weekend , and this is perfect . The fabric is soft , but a little thin . The price was worth the wait for the long shipping time . I 'll be back to buy another top like this one .	1
Great shirt looks like the picture even better in person , true to size this is a loose shirt very soft and comfortable does fall past my waist and sleeves like the picture just below the elbow.Stitching was perfect did n't see any imperfections with this shirt.Seller is great arrived very fast and packaged perfect !	1
Love ! I was hesitant to buy something from overseas , but it arrived much faster then expected . Fits great , casual , loose but not too loose . Great with both leggings and skinny jeans !	1
The shirt fits just as the picture shows . I love it and since it 's so long , I wear it with leggings and its looks really cute . And after reading some reviews about the cheap materials from this seller , I think the material is actually pretty thick and not cheap . Would recommend it .	1
Allegra K has been fairly hit or miss for me , but this shirt is so cute ! It fits great and does n't cling too much in the middle , but does at the hem . On me , the bottom sits just below my waist , above my butt . Got compliments the first day wearing it , great deal .	1
When I received this cute top , I anxiously tried it on . I thought it was going to be long fitted on me , but did n't come nearly close to the length like the one that is demonstrated . I love it , but really wish for it to have been longer .	1
I ordered this top in both gray and tan stripes mode ; it is a very good design , slimming and fun . A good buy .	1
There 's really nothing bad I can say about this shirt , the material is stretchy and comfortable , and it looks really cute when wearing it , I 'd gotten several compliments on it as soon as I started wearing it . I will , and am , buying more products from Allegra K. : D	1
I adore this top so much . I may have to buy another.I 'm rather short ( 5'4 & # 34 ; ) , on the bigger side ( 190 ) , and I wear a 42D bra . I bought this top in large , because I read that it runs bigger , an I 'm glad I did . It fits me perfectly .	1
I 'm glad I ordered this much bigger than my US size 10 . It looks and fits like just like the picture .	1
You do n't have to wonder how it will look on you , just look at the picture . The material is thin but not sheer . I wear this top to work with tights all the time , looks great !	1
Love the color , the style , everybody love it ! ! ! very comfortable , wash and wear ... ..Two thumbs up for Allegra K the seller for introducing all the pretty , elegant style ... ..	1
This shirt is really cute , and I like it a lot , but the shoulders are quite a bit wider than I anticipated . I have decently broad shoulders , so anyone who is more narrow in the shoulder should be warned .	1
Very practical . Soft and fits a little smaller than I wanted . I am 6 ' tall and 145 lb , the length was good but I think the sleeve is a little to long so when you position it at mid arm and it ends up bulking up	1
love this top , it goes great with both my brown slacks and black slacks for work . I may order in another color ...	1
Bought it as a gift . Nice fabric , well made , color is as expected . The receiver of this gift loves it . I am thinking of getting one for myself .	1
Just what I expected . Love the fit and looks great on Goes well with the long open sweater I had and the gray and black leggings .	1
I love this one . I ordered a Medium and I wear it as a dress over leggings . Fits me perfectly baggy not tight at all but looks great . With some black leggings and my brown boots looks great with it . I 've had nothing but compliments . May order in other colors for next years cold season .	1
This shirt was great for the price . Great addition to wardrobe . Looks just like in the picture , I am very happy with this purchase . Got a med for the length ( wanted long ) and ir is perfect . I an 5'5 about 118 lbs .	1
I ordered one for myself and one for my sister . We both like them . The item fits true to size and the material seems to be of good quality , although I have not washed it yet . The shirt can be worn with leggings , jeans and casual dress pants . I am considering ordering another color .	1
I am 5:4 and weigh 125 . I usually wear a small , but this is more like a jr 's small . I wanted it to fit lose like the pic but it more fitted and short . Not sure if I should go 1 size up or two . My daughters glad she gets to keep it .	1
Esta prenda es verdaderamente mas hermosa al verla en tus manos que en la foto , la tela es muy suave , el dise & ntilde ; o es mejor y es mas bonita .	1
I am very much into quality when it comes to tops . Allegra K exceeds my expectations every time . I love this shirt . The buttons were a cheap plastic , but I cut them off and the shirt is such a nice quality shirt .	1
Product is made of good materials and I would recommend to a bigger woman . Its baggy and very comfortable to wear . Looks just like the photo	1
I 'm 5'1 '' and 130lbs . I ordered the small , and it fits exactly how it looks . It 's cute enough to wear to my business casual job with slacks , or with legging or jeans .	1
The 2 little white buttons landed in an inopportune spot so I removed them . It looks a lot better without it .	1
I wanted something to wear with leggings in the Fall . This is nice , it 's a bit thinner than I thought , but it looks great ! Very similar to the picture	1
For Allegra K its true to size and Loose and comfy .	1
VERY NICE TOPORDERED ONE SIZE LARGER THAN NORMALFIT PERFECT THENSEEMS TO BE THE TREND OF OVERSEAS SIZES	1
It fits well . The only problem that I have is that the buttons look VERY cheap and tacky . I may try to replace them with better quality buttons .	1
I love this shirt ! I got lot of compliments about it ! It 's baggy but it 's perfectand comfortable . I totally recommend it . I 'm about 5'3.5 , so I 'm pretty small and small fits bigger but perfect .	1
I really like this shirt . It looks just like the picture and fits about the same on me as it does the model , just a little shorter . I 'm 5'7 for reference .	1
I love this shirt its just like the picture fast delivery . the shirt is soft and it does n't feel cheap . This shirt is currently my favorite and wear it a lot .. I wont be throwing it in the dryer because I do n't want it to shrink .. but this is such a comfy shirt fits perfectly and I 'm pregnant it has enough room for me to grow I do n't have a belly even though I 'm 4 1/2 month 's pregnant not short from the sleeves I do n't have anything negative to say about the seller . I will be purchasing more items from this seller	1
I ordered a rather large amount of shirts from this seller and this one is my favorite ! It has such a nice fit and is very cmortable . I 've gotten tons of compliments on it ! I would recommend it to all of you .	1
Nice top . It fits well on me and it covers my behind which I like . The buttons on the top are very cheap and plastic but the top is definitely worth the price .	1
The fit is different from what the pictures shows , but overall the color and detailing seems to be fine , I ordered a small , and should have ordered a M , probably would get the same look as the model if the size was bigger . Cute top though .	1
I always go larger with this brand and they always fit well . This top looks just like the picture , very soft comfortable material and great quality . Highly recommended : )	1
I absolutely love this outfit ! I wear it as often as I can and I always get compliments ! I definately recommend this item !	1
It is smaller than I would have liked but it is really well made and fits fine - I just wanted a baggies look . It is more conventional looking I guess , then what I had hoped for but I do really like it anyway .	1
Very cute with leggings and boots . A wonderful fall must . Fits as expected . I 've only had one shirt from this seller that I have not liked .	1
I just received it and I must say it looks really nice ! ! , i am going to wear it around the house with some leggings ! ! perfect for the fall weather and cold spring , i am 5'5 and 165 i ordered a medium and fit just fine	1
I was a little weary buying Allegra K because of all the bad reviews it received , however this purchase could n't have gone any more perfect . It arrived 10 days early and it 's exactly like that picture shows ! But the shirt does smell funny , so i just washed it- love the product !	1
The shirt that started my love affair with Allegra k. Very cute , fit well and the small was true to size for me . Just barely came down below my bum , but I 'm 5 foot 8 .	1
One of my favorite shirts . Super comfy and stylish .	1
i gave this tunic 5 stars because it is cute and the material is really not bad for what you pay for . i 've bought lots of items from allegra k and i have been happy every time . fits true to american sizes .	1
I use this to sleep in and it is comfortable enough . I adore B & W stripes and the shirt was very cheap , so I have no complaints . Just be prepared for a long shipping wait as I believe it ships from Asia .	1
This is a fun tunic shirt and it is made of comfortable material . I would suggest ordering one size up because it appears that it runs small .	1
I normally make sure to order a size up just in case the items run small , especially if shipped overseas ; however in this case the tunic was a true large it is definitely still wearable but it fits pretty true to size . As far a quality goes , the material is on the thin side , but for the price its what I was looking for .	1
my daughters friend had me purchasethis shirt for her . She used this shirt for a costumecomfortable and better quality than I and she expected	1
I love my shirt , It fits perfectly . I wore it twice in one week . I like that it covers my bottom area , in a nice way .	1
I was worried with the horizontal lines the this would not be flattering ; however , it looks great on . It shipped quickly and fits as expected . Love it .	1
It seems to fit true to size . It is cute , but the material is a bit thin . I could see through the white stripes fairly easy . Definitely would want to wear the right undergarments when wearing this dress .	1
This is a very cute dress for an incredibly great price . I would order again . : )	1
I 've worn it two times since I 've purchased it and ca n't get enough . It 's so snug and well fitting . I love purple , so this goes great with a pair of black or purple leggings and some really cute boots .	1
I love , love , love this shirt , soooooo cute , perfect with leggings , jeans , or nothing ! One of my faves so far from allegra k	1
Is slightly large but looks like a dress also ! : ) very warm and really comfortable . I love it , very casual .	1
I like this top it fit pretty good . wish I could find it in a few more colors good buy	1
Runs a little bigger , but not so much ! ! it fits a bit snuggly but I can wear it . Could have fitted in one smaller size though . it is longer than I though , so I did n't have to wear pants/leggins . It is more like a dress .	1
Washes great & comfortable fit , love this dress with leggings ! ! ! Unbelievable value for the money ! Will buy more in other colors .	1
Very cute and pretty . I am 5.5 and 115 with a D cup , I ordered a small and it fits wonderfully . Its long enough to wear as a dress without me feeling exposed . Would buy it again .	1
I 'm 5'7 and normally wear a size 8 ( =M ) but since the reviews were mixed about the correct sizing I decided to follow the guidelines from another Chinese store I bought from on Amazon . They recommended always buying their products based on bust size so , with a 38C , I fall into a size L ... .never failed me before and did n't fail me this time ! It took 2 weeks for the tunic to arrive : shorter than stated but longer than other reviewers ' experience , BUT it was worth waiting for . The fabric is very soft and not too thin . The size is good , I probably could have bought a size M and fit in it fine but I prefer it a little looser rather than too tight . If I extend it to full length it hits just above my knees , but I like it better a bit ruffled up , hitting just below by bottom and looking more like a long shirt . Overall I 'm very satisfied with this purchase and glad I gave it a chance since a few of the reviews almost scared me away from this item .	1
Cute Tunic I order it for my daughter and she loves it . It looks just like the picture and I recommend this tunic if you like tunics .	1
I ordered this dress the other day and it fits great . I 'm 5 foot and 102pounds and I oreder an xs . Prefect size and length . Love it and for the price I 've very happywith this ! ! !	1
Soft fabric , colors exactly as shown , comfy long sleeves . I normally wear a US M and I got a L due to the difference in sizes in Allegra K products and this is a bit baggy , but comfy baggy not scrub baggy .	1
this dress , or whatever it is , fits perfectly . i wore it to class the other day and got tons of compliments . it also arrived way earlier than expected .	1
Great heavy material and it looks very much like the picture//.which never happens.LOVE it . Will be in heavy rotation in the fall . LOVE	1
LOVE THIS DRESS SO MUCH I ORDERED ANOTHER ONEIN DIFFERENT COLOR AND IT FIT EXACTLY THE SAMENICEST DRESS IVE ORDERED FROM AMAZON !	1
this dress i bought for my duaghter 5 ft and 100lbs about . is so cozy and comfy she just crawls into it and washes it by hand so it doesnt wear off . silly but i ended up ordering one for me . the fit is perfect	1
its a little small , its shipped from china so i am sure that thats why its a bit small on american women but its pretty . the white is VERY SEE through	1
GRANDDAUGHTER WEARS THIS WITH A PAIR OF GRAY TIGHTS AND IT 'S A GREAT LOOK FOR A TEENAGER . WELL MADE , WASH AND WEAR .	1
I love this top ! It 's very comfortable and I 'm able to wear it to work and on a semi-casual night out in San Francisco . I 'm 5'7 & # 34 ; , 150lbs with very full DD cups and this top fits me in a very flattering way .	1
Again as with the other color I bought this one is a little baggy but very well made and super cute .	1
Love the shirt wish they had my size in other colors	1
I love this dress , I ordered in xs and it fits great . A little short but perfect to wear with leggings .	1
Im 5.3 120 pounds I buy a small size . Is a little 2 big I should order XS . but still nice is very warm the colors are very nice looks better with leggings . I do recommend this product is very nice .	1
But after a few washes it will be perfect for me allegra k is the bomb ! ! ! ! With this color wear the color tights that the picture have in the model u ca n't go wrong	1
It 's exactly as it looks . A cotton comfortable , everyday type of dress . Comfy and casual ! Love it just for a lazy roll out of the house kind of outfit .	1
Love it , I got a size bigger just in case . U can always sew it tighter . Nice . I say wash and hang to dry	1
I love the colors on this . But its sort of too big for me , especially around the shoulders . Hence a star less	1
Very happy with it . The shipping was actually pretty fast . It fits great . Its also very comfortable to wear . Great for any time to wear it .	1
another positive feedback to allegra ... .i got it today in a good condition..no smell..i purchased mine & # 34 ; small & # 34 ; .. i 'm a 5'1 // 110 lbs..	1
Think I ordered a Large & it fit well , just like the pic , very comfortable cotton material . I hope it does n't shrink .	1
Love the length and it has great color and texture . It was very soft and I got a lot of compliments on it !	1
Nice color , good fit , good price , good length . I am quite satisfied with it and it looks good on me !	1
soft , warm and comfy ... fits as pictured ... love it ! My roommate is actually jealous of shirt paired matching tights : ) I can also wear it as a dress like the model in the pic	1
Thanks love it.it fits and fill fine .good looking out for us full figured women..you are the best.god bless ...	1
Love thecolors , can pair with anything , especially lleggings . Fit was as expected . Arrived on time . Would highly recommend this one..	1
i like this shirt . it is perfect for winter time . looking good and nice..i would buy again if they had different colors	1
This seller is hit or miss . Some things are great , others are garbage . But this one is AWESOME ! This dress is very cute , perfect for a Friday at work or date night , but it 's also very comfortable . The material is thick , so it 's also very warm . It fits true to size . For the price , I would DEFINITELY recommend this dress . I really enjoyed it . Plus it got here from China relatively quick .	1
This Tunic shirt looks just like the picture .Very roomy believe this is true to size even after washing this and placing it in dryer on highest setting it did n't shrink . Very soft material I believe cotton , there was no tag so not to sure could be worn as a dress but short or would look great with leggings and boots .	1
I was very pleased with the look , fabric , size and fit of this dress considering the more than reasonable price . It is unique and quite stylish as well as comfortable . Will be great with ankle boots , tall boots , or ballet flats or dressed up with heels and even with a vest over it . Very versatile . I love it !	1
Never GOT this item - but gave a 1 STAR because the replies from the SUPPLIER was GREAT.They tried to send the item more than once.My $ was refunded in a timely manner too.It was a shame I never got it for my daughter - it would of looked great with her OUTFIT for Dr. Seuss WEEK at school.Most original.Maybe next time .	-1
I bought this product a little over a year ago . Now that I am done with it , I wanted to sell it . I put it on eBay and Craigslist . They had their lawyers contact the sites and have them remove the listing.Apparently in the tiny 4-point font disclaimers on the package it says that the license is not transferable , so you ca n't sell it as a used item after you 're done with it.Total crap !	-1
Have they lost their minds ? ? ! ! Over 100 $ for a costume ! ! Amazon , you are an idiot . This is an inexpensive costume . It better include a meeting with Tom Hanks for that price .	-1
This would have worked fine if the buckles had bee the same as on my luggage , but they were n't , so I had no use for the thing .	-1
If you 're trying to connect two 50 lb suitcases together , this is not the strap to use . Look for the Travelon Multi-Bag Stacker , Black , One Size.This simple buckle and strap looks easy to use but it is n't . When you 're in a hurry and you need to adjust the tension on this strap , you 're fussing around with it in baggage claim . The Travelon Multi-Bag Stacker has extra `` tongue '' to quickly pull on ( like a backpack strap ) so you can clip , pull to tighten , and GO.This Lewis N Clark strap is good for light loads and smaller bags . For larger ones , this one was a pain to use . You get what you pay for . Choke up the extra $ 5 and get the Travelon , you 'll be glad you did .	-1
I ordered the jet pack for my 6 year old grandson for Halloween 2011 to go with his Buzz Lightyear costume . Unfortunately , when we blew up the jet pack the day before Halloween and my grandson wore it for about an hour , it began to deflate quickly . We found a hole but were unable to patch it up so that it stayed inflated since the break was in a crease in the plastic material . Luckily , I was able to find and purchase another jet pack at a nearby store in my city which held up fine on Halloween .	-1
I expected a lot more from a & # 34 ; wrist computer & # 34 ; selling for almost 250.00 , and the Military version for $ 300 . First of all the visibility of the display is much too dark . The images of the X-Lander on the Amazon and Suunto websites have been enhanced to the point that a case could be made for false advertising . Secondly , the instructions to set the numeric values ( meters vs feet , etc . ) are n't even covered in the instructions that come with the watch , you have to download the full set of instructions to figure that out , then some of the fields used to set the values are so small and located in such bizarre locations , that even with 20/20 vision , I had to use an illuminated magnifying glass to see , then set the values . Thirdly , the backlight feature is useless in low light or bright daylight . It is only good for pitch black darkness ... much too dim , but is probably the same as their military version , which has to be at a low level to keep the wearer from getting shot ! Fourth , ( probably for the same reason ) the alarm is not loud enough , especially if you are wearing the X-Lander under a couple of layers of clothing . As others have stated , it should not be counted upon as a means to wake you from sleep . Fifth , the barometric trend indicator is totally unreadable ... too small and too dim to see under normal circumstances unless you also happen to be carrying a small foldout magnifying glass ( which , as it turns out , I do carry while trekking ) . Finally , the feature navigation is not intuitive , meaning if you do not use the features and sub-features regularly , good luck with remembering how some of the functions are accessed , and turned on and off , unless you carry the instructions on your person.I am going to keep this & # 34 ; wrist computer & # 34 ; for trekking , but it will not be the watch on my wrist for everyday casual use . That honor will still go to my Wenger Military . Because of that , there should be a way to shut off the X-Lander ( short of removing the battery ) so the battery does not run down while it 's in the safe ... still hoping to find out how to do that ... does n't have a stem to pull out like a watch.I can not recommend the X-Lander . It is feature-rich , fairly compact and lightweight , but the issues above make it less than desirable and overpriced . The Finns need to address these issues before I buy another Suunto & # 34 ; wrist computer & # 34 ; .	-1
Yelp , I guarantee this costume will rip on the 1st day of play . It is really cheaply made . It 's the same cheap costumes that you find in walmart for 7-10 bucks . And I had to cut out a nose and mouth it does n't give them a place to breath out of . YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR so do n't pay over 10 bucks for this temporary costume	-1
My daughter recieved this purse as a gift and we found it was missing some of the pieces . Since the pieces were sealed in a bag , it was a clearly problem from the manufacturer . When we went to exchange it , we found all of the purses on the shelf were missing at least the mirrors ! Pretty bad quality control , if you ask me . We ended up stuck with an incomplete toy ... pretty dissapointing .	-1
Hard to beat the price but I did n't expect that Casio still made this bad back lighting for night viewing . I gave the watch away a day after I got it .	-1
this watch should just be for a woman 's waist . It is really a small watchactually gave it to my 15 year old Grand-Daughter	-1
The title says it all . I loved these , but you literally have to wrestle your kid and near mangle his feet , even when a size or two too big- to get them on . THEN you have to lace and tie them ! On a kicking toddler ! Yeah , right ! IMPOSSIBLE to get on for the most part . And do n't seem comfortable either . they need to create this same shoe , but but an easy access ZIPPER on the side , down to the toe bed to get the young child 's foot inside .	-1
Like : Great look.Dislike : This item weights a ton ! Tongue moves around.Insole is so flat , I get sore feet after just 10 minutes walking .	-1
My son only wore these shoes once ( he 's only 2 ) because they cause so much distress to get on and off , we just do n't bother anymore . Why they dont make a hidden zip for the toddler sizes is beyond me . They 're expensive so wait until they 're older before buying this type of shoe .	-1
Great fabric and tight fit . Problem is that if you are over 6ft tall , then all Under Armour products will be too short in the torso . This company does not listen to the customer .	-1
El vendedor debe revisar las opciones , Me enviaron unos calzados de recien nacidos y seleccione uno de ninos , mi hijo esta muy molesto .	-1
These shoes run so big , and the size is very confusing . I emailed to find out if I could just exchange for a smaller size , but they wo n't do that . I have to send them back , and buy another pair . No thanks .	-1
I did not know that Converse stooped that low to get their products made in Vietnam or else I would never have bought them for my young nephew .	-1
Do these shoes always run so big ? I had to sell them to a friend who has a much bigger foot than I .	-1
I closely studied the strange sizing chart for this bra , and ordered a size 3 a few months ago . This turned out to be too big , so I ordered a size 2 . The size 2 was way too small ! I am about a 38F ; the 3 had too much room while the 2 did n't even fit around me . This gap in sizing has me confused but maybe when I lose some weight I will decide to try this bra again .	-1
If you like breasts that are cube-shaped , this is the one for you ! As much as I loved the back of this bra , I positively gasped at how it made my chest look . It got rid of any roundness , and just flattened the front ... not a flattering look . Returning tomorrow ... and the search continues .	-1
I bought the size that fits 34DD and I feel so constricted in this thing ! It 's not comfortable to run in for me . I feel like I ca n't draw enough breath . However , it does hold my top in place , so I do n't move at all .	-1
again , i bought this based on a recommendation of a friend , i absolutely hated the fabric it was a cheezy almost las vegas type shiny fabric , ugh also the straps were too short . i couldnt fit it right . did not like the front closure either , , you need a whole day just to get the thing on ! dumb design in my eyes , i sent it back ,	-1
I heard great things about this bra . I am a size 36 E ( DDDD ) and got the size 3 . This should fit based on the measurements provided in the sizing guide . It is hard to get on , so I know I could n't get a bigger size , but my boobs bounce around like crazy and hurt . I expected to have a lot more support	-1
I do n't like Ameribags because they are too hard to store things in and find things in . I do not like their bag .	-1
It 's not what I expected and it is to small . I will be giving them as gifts instead . Thank you !	-1
First of all I want to say that it is a lovely , well-made wallet . The problem I have is while it has many slots , it does n't close well when the slots are all or even mostly filled . The change purse clasp pops open and so does the snap closure . I am surprised that no else has reported these issues .	-1
I did n't think it was easy to open or that it stored cards and bills well . I sent it back .	-1
after reading all the reviews I was sure this was the wallet for me . It 's very low quality leather and does n't look well-made . It does have many , many card slots , but it seems it would break if they were full . Returned it .	-1
I did n't like the way the credit card sleeves were laid out and there was no zippered compartment . It was also slightly ugly . I sent it back .	-1
The card slots in the wallet are too tight . You have to force the cards into the slots and then they are almost impossible to get out . I used the wallet less than a month and the sides were already tearing away . I 've gone back to by old wallet .	-1
This is a nice wallet until you put a 'few ' cards in it . The card holder inside is made of leather type material and when you add just 8 cards ( which includes the drivers license , library card , 2 medical cards , AARP and towing cards-no charge cards ) it becomes so bulgy that where it snaps the space is approx 1 1/2 inches apart and will grow if more cards are added . Sorry to say , I have gone back to my old wallet as this one just does not work out for me .	-1
If the inside pocket is n't weighted down it flips upside down . If it is n't snapped shut in both overlaying flaps everything is all over the ground with the risk of losing cards and IDs . I even had a nightmare about on my second day of owning this . lol	-1
The check holder I received with this clutch was not removable , thus limiting its use for me , since my husband and I share the checks . I returned it to Amazon , a company that is the most cooperative I deal with .	-1
Large chest women can not wear theses.You know how difficult it is to tape things , just imagine your boobs.I had to try for only $ 10 . I wrote the review so you do n't have too.And I only intended to wear these with a strapless bra for more support , not alone so I was not expecting too much .	-1
I am a 38D in all bras , Victoria Secret , Playtex , Beyond Bare , but this one is way tooooooo tight . The cups are also a little too small , and yes , as another reviewer mentioned , I also feel like I looked like torpedo chest too . I would not recommend . I love Playtex bras but they made a mistake with this one .	-1
Bought a 40DDD . This bra is offensively ugly and clumsy . It has a lot of padding which makes my already large breasts look enormous , The cups are moulded and - of course since it 's Playtex - they are pointy . I was stunned at how horrible it looked on . Add to that the fact that the underwire and band are very uncomfortable ; they do n't lie flat against your body , yet they chafe and rub . I 've learned my lesson now . I 'll never buy Playtex again .	-1
The bra fits well but the cups are far larger than desired . Your boobs wo n't just flop around , they 'll look freaky .	-1
Had to return . Will have to find a place that sells full-size slips to try on . Do n't use Victoria 's Secret , they are way expensive .	-1
The pink color was very faint - almost white . The quality on these was a little disappointing as well . The little pad in the middle was way off-center on almost every one . They did n't stick as well as other brands i 've tried as well . Would not buy again .	-1
I ordred Queen size ... .It looks like my child 's 6x tights . It 's no way I could get a leg into these .	-1
This is a great idea , but they are very hard to put on by yourself , and they pop off real easily .	-1
Truly terrible . I purchased two of the three packs and upon opening one package I discovered that they were full of pulls that would lead to runs during/after first use . Next I tried on another pair only to discover that whilst the length of the stocking was fine the spandex/elastic was so weak that they almost immediately fell down even though they fit . Also , I found them to be very sheer . I thought that by purchasing the 'fantasy black ' that they would be more like tights in color but that was not the case . Overall , very unhappy with this product and will be returning for a full refund .	-1
Well I guess thy r ok but the stockings had a run in them after only 1 use and the skin under where the rubbery part is that holds them up was really sore after wearing them so um I 'm not going to so I guess the run in them dues not really matter just if u have sensitive skin u may want to not get those .	-1
I am a solid 32DDD . I 've been measured and that is the size of bra I wear in brands across the board . This bra has this weird extra nipple room that I did not need . I 'd probably be able to fit a tablespoon in there and fill lit perfectly . It is n't that the cup is too big , it 's only this extra nipple space . The bra is also scratchy . I 'll give it the benefit of the doubt and wash it a few times before I go to put it on again . I can not wear it with t shirts or thin dresses because of this extra nipple room , and because it does create sort of a torpedo effect . I would n't compare it to the torpedo boobs you 'd see on Marilyn Monroe and the likes , but it definitely does give a point to the breasts . I will only be able to wear this bra with clothing that is thicker , like sweaters , or dresses that are double layered or have thick material . I also ordered Wacoal La Femme Contour Bra . This bra is AMAZING . The Bali Bra in my size has 4 hooks and very large straps also , the cups go very high on the breast , covering almost the entire breast , making it illogical to wear with anything that shows even a little chest ( not breast ) because the bra is visible . The Wacoal bra is unbelievably comfortable and only a tad bit more in price .	-1
I normally wear a 42 B but I had to buy a C in this . It fit but man is it scratchy material !	-1
I was looking for a casual bra to wear when I worked in the yard and chose this one based on reviews and price . It 's going back.The bra is thin with old fashioned pointed nipples . The material fails to stretch to adapt to breast dimensions , causing some areas to be too tight and others too loose . It felt uncomfortable ( not too tight - just too rough ) as soon as I put it on.Because it 's a Bali , it 's probably durable and would hold up over time better than cheaper bras but I just ca n't get over the positive reviews so I 'm giving it only one star.For a better fitting and much more comfortable bra , try a Victoria 's Secrets wireless cotton bra . It gives you the smooth coverage you want , excellent support , and you wo n't even know you are wearing it .	-1
Itchy , pointy , and VERY uncomfortable ! How in the heck did this bra get so many good reviews ? I think one star is one too many .	-1
I really wanted to like this as an everyday bra but unfortunately while support is good , the shape is quite off , cone shaped cups are rather rigid and leave the 50 's bullet impression that is quite unnatural and not flattering on anyone .	-1
Wow ... I should have listened to the other reviews . While it looks comfortable -- it is n't . The edges alone are scratchy and the torpedo look I could move past as I 've had one other bra do that to me in the past , but after some time it worked itself out . I 'd have ignored it completely if not for the scratchy feeling at the hem lines . There for it 's being immediately returned .	-1
After trying this on , I 'm wondering what bra everyone else got that posted a review . It 's comfortable and supportive , but it ran at least a full cup size small . And the shape - so much torpedo . My chest was so pointy it looked sharp . I 'm sending it back before I hurt someone .	-1
I chose this low rating because this bra is highly structured and not made for comfort . It 's not right for me , but others may like and choose this type of bra . It reminded me of the 1960 's .	-1
I was doing a lot of reading online . And the bras with the best support are seamed bras . Most of the new seamless bras are overly padded and flatten me out.I looked at my local stores but it 's very hard to find a seamed bra that is n't a minimizer in huge sizes . Most start in D cups.This is an attractive bra visually and I would normally just order up one size , but I look like I should be the musical `` Grease . '' Or in a 1950 's TV show.My husband said I was a walking weapon in this thing . I could use my breasts to poke the eyes out of a potential attacker.It does not look like the photo of it on amazon . Anyone who put this on , would have to push their breasts into the front of the narrow part of the cup to fill it , and would end up looking pointy .	-1
I doubt anyone 's body is this shape , or that anyone would rate the fabric as comfortable , it 's scratchy ! Nothing like the picture ...	-1
I usually wear Lilyette Minimizer bras , but now they do not even make the one I really like . So I decided to try the Bali Minimizer , but although it fits , it does not minimize like the Lilyette does .	-1
I really wanted this to fit and be my go to bra because it holds you up and in so well but the sides are to high on my underarm and it chafes . if find this to be a problem in some bras so it 's not a defect but probably my body vs someone else 's . I tried going down a size but did n't help .	-1
Not the bra for large breasted women unless you 're planning on pointing torpedoes at Mars ! Seriously , what were they thinking when they made this bra . I am a 38DDD and definitely not happy with this bra . I would say it 's more for smaller breasted women who enjoy pointy breasts .	-1
It fits not too bad , but I did need just another cup size bigger . I thought I ordered triple D and that is what this says , but the bras say double D. I took the wire out , because it was pressing into my chest to hard , but the bra is comfortable . If I had the right size , I still would have taken the wire out .	-1
First off it fits way too small . I bought it because I was under the influence that it would fit a plus sized woman like me perfectly . Do n't be fooled by that ! This bra is not for plus sized women with larger busts . It looks nothing like the one in the picture . The under wires are so uncomfortable . I always buy under wire bras and this one felt like it was poking me to death and digging in under my breasts . The front of the bra sticks up and out ( the under wire ) right between the cleavage and it is very visible under any top . Getting it on was no picnic . I can usually reach back and snap it shut but this one refused as it felt too short . I had to turn it around and snap it then turn it back . It was horrible and too tight . I tried to adjust the straps and that helped a bit but still my breasts were sticking out ( muffin top ) . Nothing I did worked . All I keep thinking is that there is a reason they show these bras on skinny people in the pictures.If you do buy this bra buy it 3 sizes bigger than your normal size otherwise you will be disappointed like I am . The price for this bra is too high . The materiel is horrible and stiff , no softness to it .	-1
I wish my favorite bra had this kind of strap . Other than the strap I did not liked the way it fit me . I did wear it for awhile but not even close to wearing it out before I went back to my favorite ... .so , waste of money for me ... .	-1
The fit on this bra was not right for me . So I returned it . The straps are awfully short and ca n't let them out enough .	-1
The bra fits true to size however is VERY STIFF and a bit uncomfortable . It also has a unrealistically old fashioned style that makes it unflattering to look at . Keeping it because it great for minimizing but not the prettiest under garment in the bunch	-1
This is too expensive for the cheap quality of this product ! Because the plastic is so slippery , when you put it on the back of your bra and attempt to adjust it to your liking , as soon as you begin to raise your bra straps onto your shoulders , the little adjustment clip will slip/revert back to the starting point of where you begin when you tried to adjust it . I can see this happening if I were over weight and/or had large breast , but Im a size 8 and a B cup so this shows you how defunct this product is . Furthermore , the company I bought this from here on Amazon ( i.e . Lady Grace ) has an outrageous shipping cost ! This piece of crap should be half the cost to ship but the company charges an unreasonable shipping fee because they make you pay for them to mail you their unwelcomed catalog ( along with this cheap gadget ) which I threw in the recycling bin as soon as I got it . Total waste : - (	-1
I bought this brand and Danskin tights to see if there would be a difference in quality ( I have n't been big on Hanes , as a brand , before ) , rather than stock up on a bunch of colors in one brand.I 'm glad I did it this way , as I wo n't buy these again . They ended up getting a run the very first night I wore them , then they just tore into a hole.For starters , I did n't even like the way they felt . They did n't stretch well ( I have big hips and bought the size supposedly appropriate for me , according to the chart ) , and they were too snug around my upper thighs , of all places . It 's like they designed it for children 's legs.. very runway model , ignoring that women 's thighs are typically bigger than their calves.And they were SO THIN , I might as well have shaved and wore nothing . I bought white because I was hoping to get some white sheer like the picture , but it was nothing like that . So do n't expect these to hide any hair/blemishes you have on your legs , or even look like you 're wearing white tights.The only reason I can think of that this gets two stars rather than one is the price and I 'm pretty sure they arrived when expected .	-1
this style does not say if it is Sandalfoot or reinforced toe ... could n't buy because of that	-1
In one day I got a run and had to get a new pair , exact same problem . Wo n't be buying these again .	-1
Hanes needs some better quality control these days . The color I ordered , & # 34 ; barely there , & # 34 ; is a very dark color . It is supposed to be so light and transparent that anyone can wear it and appear to have bare legs . Overall , Hanes is a good product and fits well , but it 's a hassel to bother with returning things when they do n't catch color problems like this .	-1
I 've been needing a nude shade and this one seemed to fit the bill . However it is really thin and will probably run immediately . Also I 'm not too sure about the color for my skin tone .	-1
I bought these for my Mother who is short with heavy thighs . The fit was a little small and she found that getting them over her thighs comfortably was difficult .	-1
I do n't like control top . if you 're already wearing a skirt or tuck in your shirt or have something around your waist , this control top deal makes you feels like you are being squeezed to death . it 's just too tight and uncomfortable and really it pushes in some places .	-1
Sizing was fine , but they have a 'texture ' to them which caused them to get pulls quickly and were n't very comfortable to wear .	-1
I think a color labeled & # 34 ; Barely There & # 34 ; should be much more neutral . I realize that if I had a dark tan or were of a different ethnicity perhaps these hose would look & # 34 ; barely there & # 34 ; on my legs . But as it is they remind me of the nylons I wore in junior high , colored & # 34 ; Cinnamon. & # 34 ; In fact I may send them back , I 'm so disappointed . The shades depicted online are not at all representative . Can not speak to fit or durability as I have n't tried them on yet .	-1
Very light weight in texture I sent them back . Still waiting for credit . I thought for the weight they were too expensive . I was looking for more warmth in this product	-1
This bra is pretty , and I do love the & # 34 ; bounce & # 34 ; that a good balconette bra gives , but the straps on this bra stretched out almost immediately , resulting in me constantly pulling up fallen-down straps all day.I would n't recommend this bra is you 're a large-breasted woman .	-1
This bra fit nothing like the Wacoal and Natori 32DDD bras I purchased from Nordstrom . I wo n't say it was too large , or too small because that would n't be accurate . It just was n't *right* ... .	-1
Online this Bra looks Delicious ! I mean it holds the Babies in while looking Nice and Fashionable . The problem ? I think my Babies were a little too Big ... a little too much for Poor Old & # 34 ; Felina|Harlow-Unlined Demi-Bra. & # 34 ; They , I , did n't feel comfortable , nor safe walking or playing around in it . I think this Bra is best designed for smaller Babies , cause HOLDING my Babies was a bit Little Shady with The FELINA-Lady ! YOu dig ?	-1
This is cute but it 's scratchy in all the places you do n't want it to be scratchy like the band and the straps . The straps have nude felt-like material for additional durability but I think this is what is part of the problem because the material used is cheap . Anyways , do n't buy this one -- go to the department store and find another cute one .	-1
I was so excited for this bra and when I got the 38D the wire part fit great and actually supported ALL of my boob instead of cutting in too close on the sides . The cups were just a TAD too big , and I could have gotten it tailored I suppose but I returned them for a 38C hoping that , being a 38 , the underwire would still be wide enough too include all my bits but have correct cup size ... .cup size was alright , but the underwire was too narrow AND the underwire that came up between the boobs was too wide ! It was like pulling my boobs apart from the center ! No thanks ! Plus , it pushed really hard into my sternum ! The material was super scratchy and uncomfortable , I just wished this worked out b/c from the picture it looks so pretty but the material is awful .	-1
This bra runs suuuuuper small . Make sure you order up a cup and bands size . If I had gotten a proper size , I may have had a better review : (	-1
I wear a 38C Bra size , and this bra fits the bill ! ! ! Love it ! I just ordered another one . I would highly recommend this bra . It is very sexy , and comfortable.Update : After wearing this bra for a day , it 's NOT comfortable . I would not recommend it all , and I have returned the other one that was ordered , and the one I kept goes in the `` Not form fitting , and comfortable '' draw . I got the Marielle Unlined bra instead , so far it is very comfortable , and fits nicely to the breasts . I will be ordering another pair !	-1
I did not like the seam placement in the cups ... .it vastly took away from the style.The lace was very pretty though .	-1
I have to agree with a previous poster that said the straps were too long . I adjusted it to the shortest setting and it still was loose . I 've probably only had that problem with 1 % of all the bras I 've ever bought , and sadly this was one of them . The cups run generously sized ( which for me , as a D/DD usually is a positive thing , but in this design was too much of a good thing & I would have to size down ) . The overall design was cute , but the odd sizing made it a no-go .	-1
This is the second time I purchased a bra on Amazon and the sizing is not the same as the bra in store . I got fitted for Felina bras and was told that I am a 32DDD in their bras . When I tried the bra on in store , it fit perfectly so I decided to order on Amazon because the store price was way more expensive . This bra has so much space in the bust area that I can not possibly wear it as the 'girls ' will jiggle with any step that I make . Terrible !	-1
I wore one pair once and gave them away because I did n't like the way they felt . The fabric felt rough and the leg bands too narrow .	-1
I probably missed the explanation for the & # 34 ; seam & # 34 ; up the middle of the back side on this brief . Just a little too & # 34 ; clingy & # 34 ; for me , thanks.However ... for those of the younger set the clingy-fanny thing might just blow your skirt up.Was in a hurry when I ordered these and might not have read the details .	-1
Fits like a sack , styled like something my mother might have worn - very late in life . Not nice at all . I DO N'T wear tiny underwear , but there 's enough fabric in these for two pair , going on three . Yuck .	-1
I was debating between a 1 and 2 star rating . These Jockey briefs are good quality , but Jockey has a sizing problem between sizes 7 and 8 . I first ordered 3 size 8s and they are somewhat large so went back on Amazon , checked the sizing charts then ordered 3 size 7s . There is at least 2 or more inches difference in the width of these two sizes and the 7 is more than an inch shorter . I ca n't complain about the quality of Jockey , but sizing is a totally separate issue . The size 7s will be donated to Goodwill ASAP .	-1
I found these to be huge , far bigger than a size 6 . I have ordered in the past from jockey and found I liked their products and so ordered another style in a smaller size to try once more . I hope these fit and are not so old fashioned .	-1
I thought by ordering Jockey I would avoid the generally poor quality of underwear that seems to be in the marketplace these days . Jockey is no better than the rest . The individual panties are not cut the same despite being marked the same size in a 3 pack , and they run small to size and do not provide correct coverage as a French cut .	-1
The quality of the item is fine but there are 2 different sizes in one package of three . How can you reorder with that kind of inconsistency ? No way would I recommend this to anyone .	-1
Horrible smell gave me an asthmatic attack when they arrived . Unfortunately I bought 15 jockey underwear so they are going in the trash . Waste of a lot of money ! Shame on you Jockey ! I have allergies and asthma and only buy unscented products . There should be a warning label on these toxic underwear . Do NOT buy !	-1
I have been a jockey fan for many years but the last package was poorly constructed , very thin and has started to unravel already . I would switch to hanes all cotton ; the waistband is thinner and the fabric is less sheer .	-1
These shrank something fierce after a couple of washes in warm/hot water . The legs just became too tight to wear .	-1
When I bought these panties , I really wanted to like them , but I could n't get any further with them than opening the package . They have a & # 34 ; perfumed & # 34 ; smell . I really do n't want any fragrance on my underwear .	-1
I have bought Jockey before and they were quite good but these seem already stretched to the max Before putting them on , very little give left in the bands .I do n't know if it 's a cheap knock off with a bogus Jockey label or if Jockey is now cutting corners but I would n't buy them sight unseen again .Probably back to brick & mortar for Jockey purchases ( see what it is Before I get it ) .	-1
Cup is odd and puckers near the under arms . I 've never had that in a bra before . Material is cheap and feels & # 34 ; scratchy . This bra went back .	-1
Unfortunately these were much too small , even though I got the biggest size . I usually wear a 2x clothes , and the 5-6x did n't fit so that pretty much explains how small they run .	-1
i found the same Spanx Power Panties at Nordstrom Rack for 19.99 . Since these do n't last through too many washes ( maybe 8 tops ! ) , I think spending $ 36.00 is just ridiculous . No thanks ! ! !	-1
does I do n't was very it was too small for me to too small I ordered the right side but it still to size smaller but thank you anyway for the product I just all I did was we sell to sell it thank you though	-1
I am a fairly thin person with a little extra weight in the upper thigh area and was hoping these could minimize the look under dresses or more fitted pants , but unfortunately they did n't seem to do anything for me . They were very tight and hard to get on , and once I did I still had the same lumps and bumps . Very dissapointed .	-1
These pants are thick , and they do n't compress me very much , so they actually make my clothes fit tighter . Expensive and a waste of money .	-1
I ckecked to see what size I should order . Following as it said to dam small . I think you should be able to breathe .	-1
I thought that these would be kind of like cut-off control top panty hose . They 're more like just cut-off regular pantyhose . There was no 'control ' at all in the 4 pair I bought , following their sizing charts . Unlike other reviewers , I did n't find them too tight , in fact I thought they 'd be tighter . Regular firm control briefs are better . Waste of money .	-1
I used to wear Jockey Elance Bikini Briefs exclusively , but in the past year they have changed their design . I am a larger framed man with a 48 inch waist and I have always worn the XL size . They have always fit very comfortably and still have some give to them . But the last few times I bought this product , they have a smaller , tighter fit . Very tight in the pouch and between the legs . They also have a lower cut , both in the front and back . I 'm constantly pulling them up in the back . My junk is popping out of the top and the sides ! These might fit a woman comfortably , but not a man . There 's no stretchiness or room in the front for `` the boys . '' This bikini would be better if Jockey offered it in other facrics such as Modal , Tactel or Nylon . I do n't know why Jockey changed their design , but I do n't like it and I will not buy this product again until they change it back . Sometimes change is a bad thing ... and this is a bad thing ! May sound odd , but Jockey makes women 's panties that are FAR more comfortable compared to Elance bikinis for men !	-1
It might work for a Superman costume , but Spider man is supposed to be a weedy teenager . So it looks funny . My little boy 's Spiderman PJs are more convincing than this thing .	-1
I ordered the black leather jungle moc and received a suede pair . I called customer service and they said they would send the black leather pair overnight . When I opened the box , the shoes were BLACK SUEDE AGAIN . I called customer service and the woman did not know the difference between suede and leather . I am a server in a fine dining restaurant . I can not wear suede shoes . I am returning these again . A total waste of my time .	-1
Merrell 's WERE great , perhaps when they were made in Canada . These are identical in stated sizing to a wonderful pair of Merrell Jungle Moc 's I wore comfortably in and out of the house for years , but my heel slipped a lot in these , there was way too much toe room , and they seemed 1/2 to 1 size too large . I wear a 9.5 US Merrell but these felt like 10-10.5 's . I had to return them for properly fitting and comfortable Teva 's . I do not recommend these , I would not buy again , and I hope this helps someone .	-1
Did n't like the look of them when I took them out . Should have inspected at the store but did not . As always Amazon delivered and with no questions asked took them back ! Awesome .	-1
I have many other pairs of 9.5 W shoes and they all fit just fine . These arrived and while the box said 9.5 W , the tag inside the tongue said 9.5 . So now I have to wonder if they just dont put the W on the inside tag , or if they shipped the wrong product.I tried them on and WAY TOO TIGHT ! Obviously these are not a proper wide size so now I have to wonder if all Merrells are a snug fit and Wide really just means Normal , or if I got the wrong product . Since no store anywhere in 50 miles of me keeps the wide sizes in stock , I will never know.They look nice and seem like they 'd be comfortable if they are the right size , and I think they provide good traction on slick surfaces , but since I am returning them I didnt feel like making a trip around the block . Shame , because I think these are exactly what I need for walking around this winter.Be aware if you have wide feet you probably will not be able to find comfortable Jungle Moc 's .	-1
First let me say I love merrell shoes in general - worn them for years . This is the first time I 've tried this tyle and thhey spueak when I walk - right out of the box . Ca n't tolerate that .	-1
The size is not true . I bought a pair of 6 1/2 about two years ago from a different website and they fits perfectly . So I bought the 6 1/2 again . But they are at least two sizes larger . I have to return the shoes . I am not sure what happened . Did they do it on purpose so people think they have small feet or was it a mistake ?	-1
they looked good but were n't nearly as comfortable as i was expecting . i ended up returning them . shoes need to be comfortable ! if you want a comfortable shoe , i 'd go with the sketcher go-walks . they do n't look quite as sharp but are super comfortable . great price , too .	-1
I rodered this shoe in a 5.5w BIG GIRL and recieved and baby shoe the shoes looks like picture defintely and im sure you have seen it before however i was not able to return and get proper size at deal price .	-1
If I could give it zero stars I would . Not only was it HUGE . The body would fit my three year old ... .but the legs would fit my 9 year old . Plus we ordered a SUPERMAN costume . This showed up without a cape and was a & # 34 ; Super Hero & # 34 ; suit . The belt was made from felt and the the details were painted on with bad paint that peeled off , and were not even straight lines . Bad form Amazon for letting this one slip by .	-1
HEre 's the thing ... .everyone says these sandals need a `` break-in '' period -- - a ) that 's ridiculous , and b ) they absolutely DO NOT fit a wide foot ( E , EEE , or EEEEE ) . These are soft leather , nice looking and for a thin foot probably very comfortable . I wear a 7.5 EEE . I ordered one size larger ( 8.5 - 9.5 MEdium ) and they absolutely DO NOT fit -- while you can get your foot into the strap , they cut into the skin between the toes , and there is absolutely no way to `` break in '' the sandle ... .I wore them for about an hour and found that a ) not only do they not loosen up in any way they also dug into the top of my foot and created bloody welts . These 50.00 sandals became unreturnable because they have been worn , and they have dirt on them , and they have blood on the straps. $ 50.00 worth of garbage within one hour . DO NOT BELIEVE all these folks on here who say `` just break them in '' ... .they do not fit a wide foot , period . Save your money .	-1
So I lusted after Rainbows for about 7 years before I decided they might be worth the money.-I got a large ( I wear 9.5M ) and my foot went right to the edge , so I got an extra-large.-The wear in period was n't so bad , I did get a blister as expected.-My largest problem is that the foot surface area got so smooth that my foot kep sliding in and out of the shoe , and it dried out and rubbed up against my foot . I feel like it was polishing the bottom of my foot.-I feel like they are going to fall off when I walk-I thought there was going to be a bit more arch support.-The bottom is very hard.All in all they are good looking sandals , but I 've tried on a friend 's REEFs and they were incredibly comfortable . If I could go back in time , I would have gone with the REEFs .	-1
If you are looking for the Reeboks that were made in the 80 's and 90 's , this is not it . The first pair I ordered in the size I have worn for decades was too short and way too tight thru the toe area . Ordered a half a size larger and they were still tight thru the toe area and the heel area is too large , but the length was right . I had to use inserts in the heels and put them in a stretcher to make the toe area comfortable . Will not be ordering these shoes anymore .	-1
I have weak ankles , and decided that I needed to wear high top sneakers to give me some support . Years ago , I wore Reeboks exclusively , in many different styles , and never had any problems with sizing . I had read some of the reviews that noted that the shoes ran narrow , but I figured that I would try them anyhow.The shoes arrived yesterday . I liked the sneaker , and the way that they were made . Problem was , that after just one look , I knew that they were not for me . They were n't a little narrow , but so narrow that it was obvious , to the naked eye , that these sneakers would not fit . I tried one on , and was just about able to squeeze my foot into them . Walk in them , forget it.There way no way that I could wear them . Some people had suggested buying a larger size , but I was afraid that it would not work . They still would be narrow , and too long.I have looked all over the internet , for a basic , white hightop , at a reasonable price . Apparently anything that I have seen are either very expensive , or come in garish colors only . Any suggestions ?	-1
The nape , though comfortable , lasts only one wearing before it is all pulled . Nice feeling but last only 1 or 2 wears , which is n't good . It is hard to find a good compromise between soft and durable .	-1
Every pair of pants fit differently however before you buy these keep in mind a dungaree fit means you will be wearing them like a rap star . Hanging off your bottom , and look ridiculous . Good quality material just get a pair of suspenders with them .	-1
Have purchased Carhartt for years and recently have noticed the fit and the crew ribbing at neck have not been uniform . Different locations where made all have different issues . Purchase in question , color spinach is stamped & # 34 ; original fit & # 34 ; . No others have this and this fits the most different . Am comparing this to what I considered original fit when the product had tags . These are sized uniformly and the ribbed neck have held their shape after many washings . I 've purchased the 6.75 oz . only when stated , when no mention of weight assume their not . Am not a happy camper .	-1
I have been buying Carhartt work wear for my husband for over 20 years . I have always been happy with their quality . These tees are cut so thin that they were tight on my 6'2 & # 34 ; hubby who weighs 160 pounds . I bought the Medium because that is the size he always wears in Carhartt . Unfortunately , I was expecting the same quality as other products that I have purchased from them . I washed them before he wore them so I ended up throwing them out ! I will be looking for another work clothes manufacturer . The muscle tees are also cut too thin .	-1
The shirt 's quality was very nice , but it was incredibly long . In all fairness , I did n't realize the shirt was made to be very long . i would have ordered a small .	-1
This jacket is a different style than some of the other carhartt 's such as the camo series that has n't been around a long time . The hood on this was a couple inches shorter than the other carhartt I purchased . It does n't quit cover the face , so sent it back . I have n't run in to that style hood since the 90 's when carhartt was cut smaller .	-1
I 'm not very impressed with the quality of Carhartt bibs/cover-all I purchased -- I will admit that I have n't purchased a new Carhartt coat or bib set in a long time -- I had no idea how low the quality has gotten . First , the zippers are very cheap and get stuck easily , 2 . The canvas material is not what it used to be either , my old set seemed to be bullet proof but this new set is not the same . 3 . The sizes are so different , I ordered the bibs/cover-all a size larger than I wear , but when they were delivered and I tried them on , it was as if they were two sizes smaller . The material is thin , and the insulation is very cheap and again not what it used to be . I am very disappointed in this Carhartt product , to the extent I will probably not trust Carhartt with any more purchases . The quality is very low , but the prices are way too high for the quality .	-1
My husband is 3x type guy that works in cold areas on ocassion . He 's purchased carhartts for more than 30 years and knows they always run small so he opted for 2 sizes bigger than normal in the insulated bibs and , as it turns out , the largest size carhartt offers . Sadly they were still at least 2 sizes too small ! He was soooo disappointed to have to return these and purchase an brand other than carhartt . Wish Carhartt would review their sizing and offer a bit more of the larger sizes AND more accurate sizing information.As I said ... sadly , these were returned . : (	-1
Sized incorrectly and could not obtain them in the size / length needed for replacement . Had to return for full refund . Disappointing considering the brand .	-1
I bought one pair of these for my husband to see if he liked them . When I saw the quality and heard him talk about the comfort , I immediately ordered another pair ... ..should have ordered a couple more AND I WILL ! I usually order Levi 's relaxed but these seem to last so much longer and have the extra room men always want in certain areas ( said that as nicely as I could ) . Now , after washing a couple times , I will no longer purchase those other jeans which are very weak in the pockets/crotch area and seem to tear easily . These Carhartt jeans are amazing ! My husband really loves the comfort . I 'd recommend them for work , as well as , dress jeans . Very handsome ! You get much more quality with Carhartt and pay less . You ca n't beat that ! UPDATED : May 15 , 2014 The last jeans I purchased were washed three times and have torn on all corners of the back pockets . I should not have been so quick to give such a great review since the one pair held up pretty good . In looking at them again , the pocket corners are all thin and fraying/tearing ONE MONTH LATER . I use a light laundry detergent and do n't leave them in the washer so it ca n't be that . I guess I will have to continue my search for those sturdy work jeans . If anyone has suggestions , please let me know . Thank you ! UPDATED : June 21 , 2014 THESE JEANS SUCK ! I am returning all three pairs I bought to Carhardt . The entire seat of these jeans finally just ripped two months and just a few washes later . I have already patched all three pairs twice . The material is very , very cheap !	-1
I 've worn Rockport brand for many years and I 've purchased more than a few pair of these very shoes . However , when I purchased this most recent pair of the World Tour Classic , the decline in quality workmanship was very noticeable . The shoes are now made in Vietnam and the look of inferior materials is very obvious on this shoe . The logos and Rockport brands are still in the same place , but `` made made materials '' ( cheap plastic ? ) has replaced what used to be leather . Very disappointing for a $ 100 shoe . What has happened to what was once a good company ?	-1
Have used Rockport 's for years . They use to be top of the line for comfort , yet look dressy enough to wear in the office . Comfort , quality , and value ... ... but something changed . I bought a brown and black pair of this model . They are wearing faster than the older models and are NOT as comfortable . When you notice that you are wearing shoes that is usually a clue that something is not right . The old Rockports you could put on and walk in all day and never think about your shoes or your feet . Not so with this stiffer version . Sadly looks like when these wear out will have to try to find a more comfortable shoe .	-1
Poor quality , the price is expensive . You should buy this product with caution . I hope I can help to you	-1
These shoes have the most inferior insole of any walking shoe . If you want to add a decent insole , you wo n't have much breathing room for your foot . The shoes overall are n't as comfortable as everybody is saying , but I have a slightly wide foot . I am fine when I wear my New Balance shoes with a width of D. I do believe that this shoe is n't what it used to be . They are a decent pair of shoes for someone on a budget . I bought theRockport Men 's Ct Sport Oxfordwhen I bought these , and highly suggest those . Those shoes have a much better insole , and the shoe breathes well .	-1
the rockports are sold as walking shoes but they hurt my feet after about 10 minutes of walking .	-1
I 'll begin by revealing I am 57 years old and thus have been wearing jeans for a full 5 decades . It is safe to say I am aware of what my jean size is . In fact , as I write this review I am wearing a pair of size 33WX32L Wrangler jeans , one pair of several I own.Which brings us to these 2013 model lined Wrangler jeans , purported to be size 33x32 . The waist size on this pair is so far off I went straight to the size label to see if I had been shipped the wrong size by mistake . No , the seller apparently got it right but Wrangler has these jeans sized at LEAST one size , if not two , too small . Come on now , Wrangler has been manufacturing jeans longer than I have been alive and this is ridiculous . And , since these came from an Amazon seller , not Amazon directly , guess who pays the return postage ? These jeans were labeled as being made in Mexico ( assuming THAT label was accurate ) . I suppose when outsourcing to whichever third world nation is the low bidder , little things such as quality control and accuracy in sizing can be overlooked in the interest of saving a buck ( or Peso ) .Lesson learned : From now on I will try on jeans and personally inspect them before I buy . So much for buying jeans on Amazon , especially from a third party seller such as Sportsman 's Guide . And , so much for Wrangler in general .	-1
These are very nice hoop earrings for a child . Very small . They did not work for me , but if you like small earrings they might .	-1
I actually purchased these in March 2004 and to give some perspective , they are so well made that today they are as good when I first purchased them . I did beat the current price , but at $ 19 , they are still worth it . They are on the smaller side , as other reviews have noted , but they are still perfect for young granddaughters and those of us who prefer smaller hoops.September 1 , 2009 update : I was amazed to see that the price has increased by over 10 times since I purchased these earrings in 2004 . Allowing for the fact that gold has increased , all the same , if you buy these at the current price of around $ 140 , you will be disappointed , notwithstanding the supposed , and inflated , retail price . Why ? While they are pretty , these are very lightweight and fragile . They have held up over five years , but I am very careful with them and do n't wear them that often . The hoops are about dime sized , so they are small . My guess is that a teenager would probably break these fairly quickly , again because they are lightweight and thin at the wire closure . My opinion is that these should sell for at least 50 percent off what Amazon is offering them for at present , and if possible , I would change my rating to two stars .	-1
These earings broke a week after I got them . I was very happy with the way they looked , but than they broke . Very cheaply made .	-1
These earrings are a lot smaller than they appear on the website , I am returning them since they are much to small for me .	-1
They were pretty , but I was shocked by how tiny they were . I am a small person , but these were too small even for me . They were a very close to the earlobe fit . They would be perfect for a little girl .	-1
I rated it a 2 because the picture is grossly inaccurate ! ! ! This earring is so small and very appropriate for a little girl . I had to return it . I believe the product is of very good quality however the picture makes it look like its for an adult- when you get the earring - you will be very disappointed . For a girl 6 and under - yes however for an adult - no	-1
These earrings I had to send back because they were n't that big like I wanted them to be and they were flimsy and for the price I expected to be a bolder look , and a heavier weight .	-1
I purchased the 14k yellow gold 4mm ball earrings , and one of the balls fell off and was lost within a day .	-1
i bought it when it was in the gold box deal for $ 19.99 . it 's a very pretty and shining gold just like the photo really . the gold ball is so hollow and made it very..very thin . the push back lock is a little tiny super small that i had a hard time to hold it in my hands and tried it on my ears not easily . i 'm 4'11 & # 34 ; , my ring size is between 4 and 5 , imagine even my fingers have the hard time to put it together on my ears , that 's not good for me . when i received it , the gold ball had the little dent about 3mm , and the push back i could not use it , it fell through right away when tried it on . so i returned it without the problem . and if you are the one who always change your earrings several times a week or a month , i would not recommend to buy this one . but if you are so careful and very delicate on jewelry , it should not be a problem .	-1
I was dissappointed with these earrings as one of them was actually & # 34 ; dented & # 34 ; , pushed in at the side . I also bought the larger 6mm balls which are perfect	-1
I 've purchased the 3mm , 4mm , 5mm & 6mm sizes . I was happy with all , but not with this 6mm size . These are from a different manufacturer/supplier , Leach and Garner . While they look good , the posts are too short and very slippery , also the backs do n't stay on tight , slipping off very , very easily . I have thin to average ear lobes , but found I could n't wear these without them falling off ( potentially , getting lost ) . Otherwise , they would have been fine . I returned them and would not buy this pair again .	-1
Beautiful earrings but one of the backs was missing . This is embarrassing when giving as a gift . Fortunately , I had another from another earring , but when buying fine jewelry , this is not appropriate .	-1
for $ 10 these were too good to pass up . First noticed that the gold balls are glued or welded into the stem.. the earring is not all one piece . First time I wore them , lost one because the back slipped off though they were n't tugged or snagged to cause the earring to pop out.This is the second pair I bought ... first set was fine . Seems like the quality of construction may be slipping ( or a different supplier ? )	-1
They do look pretty but I have never been able to wear them because I am afraid they will fall and I will lose them . Definitely have to figure something out . I would not recommend them since you do n't feel safe wearing them .	-1
I used this 3x ... I lost the other one on the third use . I did n't even feel it slip off my ears . The backings come off easily .	-1
I read the reviews on this product thoroughly , so I was well-aware of the problems with the short posts . However , I have very petite , thin ears , so I thought I would be able to wear them . Not so . One earring could be worn , but I had to secure the back in so far that my ear turned red . I could not even get the back on the other earring because the post did not stick out far enough . Oh well . I returned them .	-1
Received these as a gift and while as a general rule I enjoy wearing ball earrings I will NOT be wearing these . They are going to be returned ASAP . They really are awful , feel much more like plastic than gold and are sure to fall apart or dent on the first wearing.There are other pairs of 14k gold ball earrings in my jewelry box and even the ones that are much smaller weigh more than these.If your intention is simply to just own something made of 14k gold then I suppose these would serve that purpose but if you want a pretty and serviceable pair of earrings , pass these by .	-1
I received these earrings and had the looked at my a jeweler and they are not real gold they react to a magnet I was disappointed because I paid so much for fake gold but tried to wear them anyway to see if they hurt my ears cause I have bad luck in that department and within one day the back had fallon off one of the earrings and I lost the stud . I will never buy gold from amazon again its the only time I have been disappointed by amazon	-1
These were very flimsy and the clasp broke soon after I bought these . I would not recommend them because of the clasp .	-1
All I wanted was a pair of hoop earring , yellow or white gold . I 've worn this style as every day earrings for years and managed to lose one . These looked perfect and in spite of the outrageous increase of the price of gold , I decided to order them . The size was exactly as described and would have indeed been perfect except for the following : the part that goes into the piercing is not the usual wire . Instead it is a thin flat piece of gold that is significantly wider in diameter than a wire and was terribly uncomfortable . If you are a person with stretched out piercings , this may not bother you , but it was a deal breaker for me . The second problem is that earrings like this must have a good closure . ONE of them had a very tight closure- almost too tight but I could have lived with that . The other was so loose that it would have definitely come unhooked and I would have lost it . Needless to say , I was terribly disappointed . If you are a person who is used to wearing larger diameter earrings , I would say this could be a good deal if you get a pair with decent closures . They 're beautiful and shiny and an excellent size . But if you 're like I am and thick earrings hurt you , look for ones with wire style clasp backs .	-1
The fabric is gorgeous and soft and the fit is good- maybe a little tighter than sized . But they were n't capris on me ( 5 & # 34 ; 4 ) - they were full length . And the crotch was too long . It had a seam that was uncomfortable and felt like it was in the wrong place . Going back ,	-1
Will try to return when i come from Europe . Bought them for present , but they are very tight and it hurts the feet . As a design they are beautiful but very uncomfortable , sorry	-1
The sneakers fit fine but the material that covers the top of your foot digs into your foot so bad . I wore them one time and had to stop at a store and buy myself a pair of flip flops because I could not stand the pain anymore . I wish I would have wore them around the house before so that I could have returned them for a refund . I am so mad I just threw out all this money on such a crappy pair of sneakers .	-1
would n't stay on arm too large even though can shorten ... not what expectedcute to look at but dose n't function well for wearingwould not recommendpay a little more for something better	-1
Too crowded with stuff on the face , no kid would figure it out till they are adolescents . For learners , something less complex would be better .	-1
The material is too hard , shrank after washing , do not meet the stated features , I do not recommend purchasing this bluejean , sorry I wasted my money on this product and the worst is that nobody is responsible for the poor quality of the product and deception suffered , lo us & eacute ; una sola vez y luego lo tuve que desechar , se encogio tanto que no puede volver a usarlo	-1
Very cheap quality now , also smell like wet cloth and animal waste . I ca n't get rid of the smell .	-1
I washed these jeans one time as per the label directions and now I can no longer fit into them . They are extremely too small and I feel like I wasted my money by ordering them .	-1
This is what happens when you move a quality product from the US to a foreign country for manufacture . I 've worn Levi 's 501 's since before they were even called 501 's ( over 60 years ) and this product is not a Levi 501 . It is pure garbage and I 've ordered my last pair . It really is a bummer to see what is happening to so many `` American '' products that are shipped overseas to cheap labor manufacturers . I would even advocate a boycott of Levi until they return to the quality that made them famous ... Now I have to search for a replacement ... Maybe I 'll try Wranglers ... ..	-1
I have been trying to get a few pairs of 501 Originals ( which is not the shrink to fit variety ) that fit me , and have found the sizing of 501 Originals to be all over the map for jeans that all were labled 32w x 36L or 38L . In varying degrees , all -- ALL -- had waists that were bigger than 32 . And in varying degrees all but one pair out of eight were too baggy overall ( one pair was so baggy with a waist so oversize , that I could pull them off me even though they were all buttoned up ) .Some were a little longer than specified , some were a lot longer than specified ( far as I 'm concerned , that 's a good thing : I 'd rather have a tailor shorten them after a few washings , than find that after a few washings they are too short ) .Most had strange front rises that caused , in varying degrees , the dreaded codpiece bulge ( which can be simulated by grabbing from behind the upmost part of one or both -- the bulge is not always symmetrical -- inseam areas at the crotch and pulling strongly backward and upward ) ; the worst offender in this regard was the Timberwolf color , which I ordered twice in the hope that the first pair was a manufacturing mistake , but the second pair was just as bad : the Timberwolf 's codpiece bulge was even worse when viewed from the side : hideous ! As for the button fly -- that turned out to be the best thing . I 've found the button fly to be very comfortable , more comfortable than a zipper . The buttons are no problem once you get the knack of them and once the jeans are broken in.My dimensions are 73.5 '' tall and 160lbs . And of all the 501 Originals I 've ordered , the best fitting is the Dark Stonewash in 32x36 . But fearing when I wash it the length might shrink too much , I ordered another pair of the stonewash in 32w x 38L -- and guess what : that longer pair had the codpiece bulge even though the shorter dark stonewash pair fit perfectly . I give up.ADDITIONAL INFO : the different colors the 501 Originals come in , are not all made from the same denim weight . If you go to Levi 's website , you can readily learn the weight of most of the colors there . Some times a light weight is a good thing for casual wear on a hot summer day . It 's only a bad if you did n't realize you were ordering it.ONE MORE THING : 501 Shrink to Fit is NOT the same as these jeans , which are 501 Original Fit . The 501 Original fit will behave pretty much like all other Levis that are not Shrink to Fit jeans . Many people reviewing these Original Fit 501s did n't realize they were ordering the wrong jeans . Again , Levi 's website explains the distinction .	-1
For some reason this particular color was way long . Had to return 'em for a couple inches shorter pair . Love the 501 's tho ' .	-1
Did n't like the button fly , too many buttons - 5 to be exact . Makes wearing too inconvenient . Would n't recommend it .	-1
The quality of Levis jeans seems to be a decline , an endless abyss . The back label , which supposedly should be leather , cardboard seems now . The jeans manufactured in Mexico and Egypt are the worst labels or at least , in my experience , has been . I think there should be more oversight by Levis in its factories around the world . Previously , a Levis jeans was a piece `` almost perfect '' , today I can not say the same . I totally agree with all the people who are disappointed with diminishing quality of these jeans .	-1
Way too small . Have owned a dozen pair of these and they fit perfectly . These are too small , a weird cut , definitely irregular . Very disappointing .	-1
I ordered these on the grounds that I needed a taller size . I loved the color , but they came up only midway up my buttcrack . When I did the 'crouch down ' test they revealed much , much more . The legs and fit indicated they were not original fitting as the leg stayed the same width all the way down the leg . All in all , what I ordered was completely different from what I thought I was ordering . If you 're a tall guy like me , do n't get them.Other than that , I 'm giving them two stars rather than one for nice quality and color .	-1
I dont know what is going on , but i bought a few size 36 and they all differ from sizing , i mean even though they say size 36 , they are like 1-4 cm bigger or smaller.So its like a `` 37 '' and the other is like 35 . Its really weird i dont get it why is there such a huge error in sizing , if there is one , been thinking and talking of this for days and cant find a reason or something ... They are all made in mexico , not made in colombia , i find this on my country for half price , same quality . i thought the ones found here were bad quality because of the price and this would be better , but aparently they 're not or are the same exact pant . the ones sold here are also made in mexico . Another thing i noticed is the seal on the inner bag was decolorated for 1 or 2 pants and the ones i found here some where like this too , so what im trying to say is the same pant . Im kind of dissapointed , not really the quality i was expecting for a $ 50 pant.Im not returning these , already washed them and took all the layers off , not worth the time , etc ... . =/.Your choice & lt ; > Buyer beware !	-1
Do n't be as stupid as the Levi Corporation . Although Levi jeans manufactured in the 1950 's sell for thousands of dollars in New York , the company has relentlessly degraded the product for 40 years now , trading on their name alone . They are actually so stupid as to try to compete with the slaves in a Chinese concentration camp by accepting products manufactured in Africa and South America . The original rivets are gone , their `` denim '' fabric is the worst quality ; all seams fray , especially cuffs ; belt loops fall apart ; and the only appearance achieved is shabby tissue . These fools do not have the intelligence to realize that people would pay hundreds of dollars for jeans produced on the design , material , and workmanship of the 1940 's . Stop living in the past .	-1
These jeans behave like shrink to fit jeans . So make sure that you buy a large enough size . Also , they wrinkle A LOT , and it 's next to impossible to get rid of the wrinkles .	-1
I bought the Levi 's Men 's 501 Original Fit Jean , Dark Stonewash , 38x29 . Other reviews said that the Dark Stonewash was the best material . However as someone who used to own multiple pairs of 501 's years ago I was sorely disappointed . The cut is not what it used to be . These pants should have fit my butt perfectly , but it seems the cut is now a bit saggy in the butt and crotch . The material is a lot lighter and cheaper than what I remember too . Original fit ? ? ? Shrink to fit ? ? ? Nope nada no way ! I have already washed them and there was no shrink to fit . My pair of jeans were made in Malaysia.I recommend going to a brick and mortar store and trying out various brands and sizes as Levi 's which I used to be able to buy just by size is no longer what it used to be.I give these Jeans only 2 stars : Minus 1 star for bad material , minus 1 star for bad fit , minus 1 star for not being American made any more .	-1
Paper thin fabric will not last anywhere near the 501s of yesteryear . Fit is unreliable . Feel is very disappointing . Will not buy again until Levis goes back to the old denim material . Absolutely disgusted !	-1
My husband has worn these pants since I met him in 1991 . These pants are much smaller than the pants we have purchased in the past . I 'm not sure if I 'll have to get one or two sizes larger in the waist . The other 's started off loose and tightened up a bit as they were laundered . These are so tight I 'm afraid to wash them . He can barely get them buttoned . I will need to exchange them for a larger size .	-1
there is not one thing nice i can say about buying these jeans . I have been the same size 501 's for my husband for years . so I know his size these were either missed marked or 2nd 's or something . never again will I get them here . trust the reviews on this one do n't bother to waste your time getting them here .	-1
These were poorly made , light material and just HUGE ! The front pockets sagged , the color was odd and my wife commented that she could get in there with me ( not a bad thing ) . I have 3 other pair of 501 's in the house that are the same size I ordered . These are pretty big . The other issue is they have redesigned the change pocket and made it lots bigger . So big it is nearly useless because it tucks under your belt if you wear a wide one.Now the comment about going to Penny 's . The last pair I bought there ( 501 's are the only thing I buy there ) seemed to be heavier material . Washed 501 's seem to have a lot of size variance , so trying them on is good . Second , the darker material blue ones fade more normally in the wash . These medium stone washed have the weird color that is popular on jeans worn by 20 somethings . Almost looks dirty.I 've worn these things for 40 years . I 'll keep on wearing them but I 'm not happy.These went back though .	-1
DO NOT BUY THEIR WATCHES , SAVE TIME AND grief poorly made , the strap fell apart within a week to 10 days , Amazon has good customer support , i will not exchange , just a refund	-1
The watch I received did not have the word `` Titanium '' on the dial as shown , which led me to think that it was a fake . Returned and waiting for a refund . I 'll be buying this watch again but from a different merchant . Do not purchase this particular Skagen model from Jomashop.Updates* : So I returned the watch and ordered another one , this time , from Watchstar . And guess what ? It does n't have the word `` Titanium '' on its dial either . I suspect that Amazon just sent me back what I had returned . I guess I 'll just take the 30 % off they offered for this faulty product .	-1
Very nice looking , and the illusion of being slim ... but the clasp started undoing itself within a year . Replaced it with a model with leather strap , but one day the crystal just ... cracked ! For no reason . Skagen is junk .	-1
I have purchased different brands and sizes of Knee Highs . My legs are pretty wide at 200 pounds ; but these knee highs are supposed to fit someone much bigger and heavy than I . NOT TRUE . I had to return them and have given up trying to find a pair of stockings/knee highs that I can wear without being tortured . I am very short ( 5 ' ) so it 's impossible to find regular stockings that wo n't choke my waist , and the same goes for the knee highs . I have tried & # 34 ; Q & # 34 ; sizes to no avail , the elastic at the top is always terribly uncomfortable . If you read this and have any ideas , please contact me ? Thanks !	-1
Do not buy this product . I only used it a few times and the zipper broke on the two large compartments making it utterly useless . I purchased this so I could put liquids in it to prevent spillage in my suitcase but low and behold I can not use it anymore .	-1
I purchased these shoes for my husband who was opposed to wearing them initially . After some coaxing , he raved about the comfort and is a Sperry convert . Unfortunately , after wearing less than a week , they began to fall apart . I returned them and ordered a new pair which were a size larger than they should have been despite being marked a 9.5 . Sooo , I returned them again . This time , we 'll buy in person as Amazon can not be trusted to deliver a quality product that is sized correctly .	-1
The snaps are cheaply made from a thin punched metal . Two have already sprung open and he 's worn them only a few times.This is such a disappointment because the fabric part is great and he loves the look.I would n't buy them again nor recommend them to anyone who likes suspenders .	-1
The quality does n't look great . It 's very thin and it looks like it will disintegrate if I 'm any rougher with it . The sleeves were too long and the neckline as sagging . Does n't keep me that warm either . A cotton shirt might have been able to do the same job .	-1
This was a very pricey item that was a poor fit . While it was warm , the arms were too long and the material did not hold its shape once it was put on . It just kept stretching .	-1
very light material and look very cheap ... with first wash shrank and became loose . very unhappy with this purchase . I regret buying them .	-1
I do n't know if these are warm , they were so flimsy that I knew I would destroy them after wearing only a few times . I returned them .	-1
I purchased these for my husband , and I will not purchase them again.The canvas began tearing , and actually got holes in it on the toes ofboth shoes - after just a few weeks of everyday wear.I have purchased the Saucony brand in the past , and really expected aMUCH higher-quality shoe from this company !	-1
The tiny screws that hold the lid on fell out within a month of purchase.Poorly made	-1
I feel similarly about this item as I do about Communism : Seems good in theory , but in reality , it falls apart ( quite literally ) ! I was very excited about this item , ordered it , and it arrived with the hinges already broken , w/the screws fallen out . Then , because I thought it was just a fluke , I ordered ANOTHER one , and the exact same thing happened , only this time , half of the back side of the lid ( near the screws go ) was totally split . So basically , all this item did for me was cause me a bunch of time and trouble to return . It 's tempting , but my advice is find something else- stay away from this !	-1
It ran for two weeks . I am surprised since I have own many Timex 's over the years . None have ever quite this soon . It took several weeks to get but that has nothing to do with the watch .	-1
Timex Women 's T29271 Elevated Classics Dress Sport Chic Silver-Tone Bracelet Watch - felt cheap and was way to big for a woman 's hands . Resizing would have made it look silly for the number of links that needed to come out with the big clap underneath .	-1
I liked the functionality especially the countdown timer & the alarms . However , it did n't last . I was just in Mexico & condensation formed under the watch glass on a humid day . I did NOT go scuba diving while I was there . Now , the watch in useless.I would recommend the cheaper Casio which lasted almost 2 years for me until the band broke .	-1
It has a good strong alarm , and the three alarms with daily/weekday/weekend options are very handy . Also not a huge watch , very well-sized for smaller arms like mine . I had one for a couple of years that finally go too scratched up . I replaced it with another , and after one diop in the pool the crystal completely fogged up . So much for the 100 mete , good for anything up to and including snorkel diving !	-1
Within a few weeks there were many scuffs on the watch face . It had gotten to the point where I had to angle my wrist in a certain position to be able to see the time.The leather band literally disintegrated after 8 months of wear .	-1
The watch keeps losing minutes , and the light wo n't come on , anymore . Took it in for a new battery , and that did n't do anything for it . Too expensive , $ 28 , for it to fall apart so quickly .	-1
Ordered this for my wife , but returned it because she said the numbers , and therefore , the watch were too small.This might be the right watch for someone looking for a very traditional look , but it 's not large enough for today 's style	-1
Ok these will do the job if you 're looking for something that will only be needed for a few uses . The are really flimsy and once they 've been stretched to the size of your leg the next time you put them on unless you 're wearing a garter belt they are n't going to stay up .	-1
One size does not fit most . They are really loose and fall off unless I wear garters . They do nothing for the shape of my legs , but it 's not worth the hassle to return them .	-1
I am not a plus size woman , but decided to order these since I figured they 'd fit more comfortably than regular size . These fit terribly and get runs so easy ! I 'm only 5'1 & # 34 ; and wear size 12 in clothing , & they barely go above my knee and fit tight so they roll down . Terrible buy ! So disappointed : - (	-1
I ordered these in white . I was expecting them to need a garter , but they did n't . However , they were n't flattering . They 're not lace top and I think the intention was for them to be worn with a garter . The tops dug into my legs and I had to cut them and fix them . More work than they were worth . They 're also a very thin fabric , not high quality . Snagged easily .	-1
Once again from Amazon ... a watch with a short watch band . That 's one thing i like about going in a store is they have special long watches you can try on ... not having any luck here . Otherwise nice ! Band barely meets together on my wrist .	-1
Timex use to be a great company not so now . I have ordered several watches and all have quit working . I ordered this watch with several items that came in one box . Had company put the box up Christmas items opened it today to check out my items and the clock was running . No plastic strip to keep it off . Last time I will ever buy a Timex and we love buying watches . I think everyone should start buying quality watches not cheap ones .	-1
I bought this for my six-year old daughter and it lasted three days . OH ! and the first time she wore it in the pool , it filled with water . Extremely disappointing for a Timex product . My daughter has been begging for a watch but I guess I 'll keep looking ...	-1
I have at least 5 pair of KEEN 's . All are a size 7 . I ordered these in a 7 and found they were more like a 6 or 6 1/2 but marked 7 . These are a wonderful red color and very cute style . Will try again as this product is well made and wears like iron !	-1
Ordered a few of these and one pair had runs right out of the package and another pair ran just by her putting them on . Look elsewhere .	-1
I was very disappointed the first time I put these on since the cutout is huge ! It is not shown that way in the photo for this product . Also , as others wrote , they snag and mine got a hole in the toe the 3rd time I wore them so I am back to buy another brand . Also , after the first washing they shrunk and were then tight in the crotch area , which was odd . I would suggest buying another brand of crotchless pantyhose .	-1
He likes it okay as far as quality and warmth . In fact , for doing outdoorsy things such as shoveling snow , it may be too warm . The biggest complain he has is with the stiffness and it 's almost impossible to take off from his shoulders . It 's a good fit once he gets it on -- -just taking it off has been a problem .	-1
I ordered a pair for my husband but the quality of the fabric just seems too harsh for skin . Very stiff and course .	-1
I wear a 42 pants and in dickies usually purchase a 44 . These were a 50 and did n't fit . Quality seems fine , just bummed the sizes were off of what I usually order .	-1
these socks seemed okay at first , but stretch out while wearing them . Maybe I ordered one size too large ? Also , do away with that ugly beige color in the 3 pack mixed colors .	-1
They do not keep shape , run down on your feet constantly so you have to pull up to keep in place ; after two washes they look about 100 years old . I would never buy this item again ! The quality and fitting are horrendous ... wish I could have returned them .	-1
This sweater is much thinner then I expected . The photo shown to advertise it looks like the sweater is pretty thick or at least medium . When I got it , it was very thin & even looked stretched , the front design was very open . In the picture it looks like the design is stitched tight and therefore well made but the one delivered to me was n't . Also , the arms are way too long . I ordered size Medium knowing the length of the sweater is kind of long , that 's ok but when the sleeves are way too long , then it 's not practical . No wonder the women in the picture has one arm held up and the other in her pants pocket.I have ordered before from National & it was all good , but not this time .	-1
As stated , these stockings ran within twenty minutes of putting them on . I did nothing exceptional to cause it ... I just started at the toe and crept up my foot . Also , the nude color will make you look worse than dead . It is more pale than a mannequin . Just all around hideous and cheap . Do n't buy .	-1
These are not worth a dollar ... they are horrible quality and do not stay up on your thighs . I am a normal size 10 and they fell down to my ankles . Normally I would complain they were to tight as most stockings are but these were just blah . In my opinion go for something with a little bit higher quality . wasted my money	-1
I usually love everything I get from leg avenue , but these were very poor quality . the feel of the nylon was rough and uncomfortable . the tops lost their shapes and got saggy . Look at some of their other products though . this seller is usually spot on .	-1
Like I said I now know that I hate back seams it was just such a pain getting them in place and making them stay there but the thigh high them selves where really nice .	-1
Creeps up my back and the hooks do n't stay hooked that well . If you order it anyway , I would suggest going down a size .	-1
If I seem angry , I am . Leisure ? ? ? No . I bought this to hang around the house when company comes over . Forget it . Braless it is . This was not supportive so I might as well not be wearing any bra at all and be comfy.Leading Lady ... .get with the program . THIS BRA DID NOT FIT MY BIG BOOBS . Is n't that the line you are in ? ? ? Big Boobs ? I ordered two ... . and the Black bra is going to get the same review .	-1
This was so small that I could not wear it at all . I hope the problem with this bra is that the one I received was sized incorrectly . This was definitely not a comfortable bra . I am returning it .	-1
I think I would have loved this but it is smaller than any Size 38 I have and the cups are more of a C than D. Very skimpy . I have ordered other size 38 's in different brands and this one is 1.5 & # 34 ; smaller when I lay them on top of another .	-1
http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00804F5D0/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThe runs very small . I had to return it for a refund minus the handling fees . I bought a 38C because I wear 36C bra and read that this ran small , but I 'd have to order up 4 sizes for it to fit around .	-1
I originally reviewed this bra with somewhat optimistic undertones , stating that maybe it would stretch over time , or I would get used to it . But after owning it for six months , I grimly see it for what it is.-About 2 sizes too small-Unpadded-Utterly uncomfortable-A waste of money.This is mostly on me , because I did n't read the comments first . Other users have warned about these things , and if I 'd read them , I would 've skipped this one over . I was really looking forward to using this thing , because it 's so much easier to buckle from the front . But every time I wore it , I was squirming , and tugging at it to try to get some slack , and it left squeeze marks under the bustline each time . Not to mention that the complete lack of padding made for no protection , and therefore no comfort . Also , the lines that go up the breasts show through certain shirts . If you 're looking for a front buckling bra , keep looking because there are far better ones out there , and this one is NO GOOD !	-1
Pretty bras , but their sizing is way off . I had to return all of them , which was a pity because they were cute ... just clearly not sized correctly .	-1
The bra is comfortable but only for a few hours after that the front hooks start rubbing on your rib cage and it is very uncomfortable . If I had n't worn it all day , I would return this bra .	-1
I am returning this item because I like my bras to have a little more material over the breast . I do n't like push up or padded bras , but this material is so thin , that if you 're the slightest bit chilly , your nipples will be showing through your blouse . However , I did find that this bra was true to size ( 34D ) although it is a snug bra .	-1
The overall design of this bra is good - but the fit is not . It fits too tightly and is very uncomfortable . ( I wondered if it would loosen up , eventually , but do n't know if I could wear it long enough for that to happen ! ) I wear these types of bras when I work out with a trainer - usually comfortable and I do n't have to worry about straps slipping , etc . But , this bra is just too tight and uncomfortable . I have already worn it - so - I guess it will go in the give away box ! I usually really like Wacoal bras , so I was disappointed .	-1
The fabric is very thin . Coverage is a primary consideration , and I could n't wear this with a t-shirt without scandalizing the neighbors . It had to go back .	-1
The first thing you notice about this bra in Toast color is that it looks as a posture correcting device in terms of color , fabric texture , overall design and ugly straps in the back , in particular . So , in short , the look is bad , you can not undress without scaring your man . Perhaps , in black this bra would look better , but far from being attractive anyway . The cups are very thin , as other reviewers already noticed , but for me it was not a problem . Hence , I give it 2 stars for holding the straps at the center as a T-back supposed . The bust support is OK for one day until fabric stretches . Wonder why it is so expensive if it is neither good sport or comfort bra , nor a sexy dress style .	-1
The girlfriend here . I was excited to try this bra but it just was n't for me . I did end up returning it . It was accurately sized and felt very comfortable but it seemed to push down and not lift and I prefer a little lift ! Otherwise it would be a very comfortable bra . I do n't care for the extra thin cups either , I like a very slight thickness , not padded but not nylon thin either . These cups are nylon thin .	-1
I really , really wanted to love this bra . It shipped quickly and when I opened it up the product seemed to be of the usual high quality that comes with a Wacoal bra . But when I went to try it on it was far too small for me . I usually wear a 38DD and that is what I ordered . I have many other Wacoal bras and I always wear a 38DD no exceptions . But this fit like a 34DD . The cup size was fine but the band was far too small . I sadly went out of town and missed the opportunity to return it so I 'll hope that I lose a bit of weight and it will one day fit because it seems like a really good bra , just make sure you order up a size or two .	-1
Weird hook -- not standard for front-hook bras . Could n't get it hooked -- needed help . Then , it did n't fit -- cut the breasts .	-1
I bought some Old Navy fold-over jersey skirts in several colors for the summer , and took the `` no panty line promise '' seriously . It did n't work for me . Shows ight through ... period .	-1
How could they promise no panty lines when these panties show the worst panty lines I 've ever had in any panties I 've worn ? Not cool !	-1
These were too big and set too high on the waist . Otherwise they were ok I guess not mubh better than that .	-1
I bought some Old Navy fold-over jersey skirts in several colors for the summer and took the `` no panty line promise '' seriously . It did n't work for me . Shows right through ... period .	-1
They were sweaty - it was weird like wearing plastic . Also snagged and looked old after ONE washing . Whoever designed these did not try them on or wash them .	-1
While I expect these would fit ( based on my experience with other Jockey undies ) , I did not try them on , as I do n't like the looks of them . The panties are skimpy and the material is flimsy . If that is what you are expecting , they are probably fine , but not for me .	-1
Very Disappointed ! ! ! Returned ... Lace was n't soft , so definantly uncomfortable . Also , the cups are very strange . I was almost coming out if the sides because the cups extend out extremely narrow . Resembled a balloon that was n't blown up entirely . . . Best description I could come up with .	-1
I did n't look closely enough to the photo , becasue these were wierd cone cups . I liked the stretchy lace , but they are cut to make your boobs look like 50 's rockets and it just did n't fit right . Returned .	-1
These do not fit like theVanity Fair Perfectly Yours Brief 15712nor theVanity Fair Women 's Perfectly Yours Lace Nouveau Brief Panty # 13001with those panties being a size too big on me which I enjoy . These cotton panties were a size or two too small . After almost getting a pair on , I took them off , repackaged them , printed out an Amazon Return Form and immediately dropped them off at UPS - all on the same day I received them . From the previous reviews I expected bloomery , puffy cotton panties as from my childhood but it was not to be . I guess I will always wear nylon panties . I am VERY disappointed but refuse to go up to a giant size 10 or so . I gave it two stars simply because they were Vanity Fair but probably made in China .	-1
Tried these on over my panties , and it was a perfect fit . Ran them through the wash , and they came out AT LEAST a full size smaller . The shrinkage of the fabric was so bad that the elastic is actually bunched up now at the openings . The leg openings are tight now , the height of the panty from crotch to belly is so much shorter , the rear area is n't fully covered . I ca n't wear them , and i ca n't send them back now . Vanity Fair is disappointing me after many years of satisfaction.I ca n't say these are even worth trying . Keep looking .	-1
I needed a workout bra , my girls were so smashed they hurt , it is really hard to find a workout bra that does n't smush large breasts . This is unfortunately one of those , it did n't come down long enough either so I had to wear this and a regular bra over it which sort of defeats the purpose of having a workout bra- my search continues ... ...	-1
I found this bra to be uncomfortable . The straps were uncomfortable , and the band was uncomfortable as well . It did seem to provide support , however . Bali has other bras that are way better .	-1
I have a hard time finding a bra in my size , it works fine around but the cups are usally too large and bag out as is the case here . I know a good bra fit can be done because I 've had bra 's in the past that fit very well . Somehow things are not being manufactured as they once were and this bra ended up as were others - in my donation bin . Too bad really , wasted my money and am continuing to have no choice but to wear the old bra 's .	-1
I 've worn the Bali Double Support bra since the early 1980s . Certainly I 've bought other brands , and I had n't bought a Bali in a while . I was disappointed to find that as I 've aged and my body has changed , these bras no longer fit comfortably . I found a replacement by Bali that is terrific ( Comfort Revolution ) , and I returned this bra , so everything worked out fine .	-1
A style bra by Playtex I have worn for several years is not made in the band size I need now so I 'm searching for another . I 've ordered several styles by several companies including Playtex and the cups are always too big , sometimes by a lot , sometimes by a little . If I ordered the cup size I get when I measure myself by the way to measure for a bra , I would be ordering an even larger cup.This bra was okay other than being too large in the cup .	-1
Was ok for the cost , but did not support well in cups . And was not cotton where it needed to be for comfort sake [ inside under band ]	-1
The title says it all . This bra is not comfortable . Also , the cup does not fit properly . I put it in the charity box after one wearing .	-1
