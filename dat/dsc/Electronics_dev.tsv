1TB with 3.0 USB was exactly what my coworker needed for portability . The harddrive is just the right size to add into a laptop bag or backpack . Sharing files was pretty much what we use it for . It 's already programmed with NTFS due to 1TB so no need to reformat with FAT32 . Fast transfer speeds works as described . ( I did n't run any speed tests ) Just transferred files on my leasure .	1
This is the best external HDD I have ever purchased.Its size and weight are very good . The build quality is quite high , particularly the finish on the exterior . The USB 3 transfer speeds are such an improvement over USB 2 . I really enjoy the option of being able to use a ThunderBolt connector in the future without having to replace the entire drive . The connector also comes in handy if you need to connect an internal drive without opening your computer and installing the drive.Not a single complaint about this HDD . It 's great . Purchase one , you wo n't regret it !	1
Excellent drives for the price . Easy to install . Work fine . Drives operate without external power , with very low power draw from USB port .	1
I store all my large photography files on these hard drives so they do n't bog down my computer . I have 2 of these so I always have backup files . Never had any problems and there is a ton of space for the price . For all the plugging & unplugging I do , I 'm happy to report that the cords are durable & the USB ports are n't loose . That 's huge for me . I would highly recommend these to anyone .	1
Bought this to kinda unload my poor computer from all the zillion pics I take and upload ! This is worderful to have to back those up on .	1
The ability to use Seagate Plus Drives between OS and Win is a HUGE time saver . I have these drives in various sizes and love them .	1
Just using as a general back up drive , but with the usb 3.0 it works fast and efficient and it is small enough to carry around if needed .	1
This is an excellent product , and works as advertised . It is a trifle slow , and would be faster with a 7200 rpm drive , but as long as you know that going in , you should be more than satisfied .	1
No problem to start using.It is good to use normal backup as very small noise.Good bundled software attached .	1
Great storage capacity , but I have a problem because I switch between a Mac and a PC and the Mac often does n't recognize this drive . But it is small , great ability to keep things safe and you can carry a lot of material with you . Sturdy construction .	1
I really have nothing else to say about it but you have to write a certain amount of words.. so ! ! ! ! I bought two so far .. well on my way to three.. I also have a 3Tb one for home.. its light weight and great for travel..Love Seagate.. I have several other brands..Lacie and Western Digital.. Like this one and Lacie the best..Ummm.. had more to say than I thought !	1
This drive does exactly what I wanted it for and at a great price.Does not need an external power source since it is fully operational using the supplied usb cable.The drive has been in use for about a month now with no problems at all.I would recommend this drive for file backup and or storage .	1
USB 3.0 out of the box without having to purchase a separate cable . I use this with Macs mainly and also PC 's . I have previously purchased Seagate GoFlex external hard drives and they came with Mac drivers and once that was installed the Macs could write to the drives without having to reformat . However after reading the box for this drive I was under the impression that it did not need a special driver for Mac , but it actually does need one . The driver was not on the the hard drive like my older GoFlex drives had and when I went to use it on my new iMac it would not write to it until I installed the same driver I used for my GoFlex drives.So if you are having problems writing to this drive on a Mac , download the & # 34 ; NTFS for Mac OSX & # 34 ; driver from the Seagate site and you should be ok.But regardless of this little oversight it works great so far . Time will tell if it holds up as good as my older GoFlex drives	1
This drive is exactly what I wanted . Very portable , very fast , and it works on my Mac , PC , and the USB port for my TV . I can download files directly to the drive instead of my mac , then plug-and-play videos on my TV with the drive . There is however one important note : THE DRIVER FOR MACS DOES NOT WORK ON NEWER VERSIONS -This is an NTFS drive , which usually only works with windows ( and some televisions ) . This is the best format for the most part , however macs can not write to it . Luckily seagate put a driver on the drive that will allow macs to write to it . The problem is , the driver is too old for my new macintosh.Luckily , the fix is VERY easy.Go to the download section of Seagate 's website and get the NTFS driver for Mac OS . Restart your mac and it can now write to the drive , along with PC 's , and again some televisions.With the new driver , everything works perfectly . Files download quickly to the drive , then work on the television . I 'm considering buying a thunderbolt adapter to make my downloads to it faster , however I can only find GoFlex ( not backup plus ) thunderbolt adapters for Seagate hard drives . Does anyone know if the GoFlex thunderbolt adapter fits the backup plus ?	1
Using four of those for backup purposes , two of which are more than a year old . Never had any issues .	1
I have been using computers and replated peripherals since the Apple II . For what it does , this is an excellent product.It is small , powers itself through the new format USB connection , and performs the backup function with Windows 7 on my laptop flawlessly and quickly.I have not needed to actually restore files from it because my laptop has n't failed , so I ca n't rate that functionality , which is also critical.Hopefully I 'll never know.I 'll probably buy another to keep at my parents ' house as a fire insurance policy on my family photos and videos .	1
Working fine the last two months . No errors or problems . Lets see if these are as good as their first thicker 1T model with the removable nose interface . Both these removable front USB3.0 interfaces work as bare drive docks if needed .	1
size ok. usb 3.0 great . very portable . use it to backup my mac and pc . do not know yet if it is durable enough .	1
I really like this Portable HD . It is small and compact . It easily fits into any of my bags and super weight . Its plug-n-play no issues with using the device . If you are between this items and a Western Digital My Passport - GET THIS ONE . The My Passports are not very good and most computers do not seem to recognize them . The Seagate HD works flawlessly .	1
I do a full backup of my windoze laptop every two weeks ( that is ontop of any dropbox/ cubby/ skydrive/ google drive syncing ) onto this little device . Small , compact and simply works	1
plug and play , lots of space , not too big in physical size . It has a software program on it that gives some software to use for back up of your PC . Seagate has always been the best when it comes to storage . I have used that brand since the late 90 's when they just made hard drives ( maybe other things too ) . Solid , reliable and good size	1
This is the second Seagate Backup Plus that I 've purchased . It 's reasonably priced for a USB 3.0 device . I have a laptop so I 'm always looking to expand storage . It 's also great because I can plug it into the Blu Ray player and watch movies without needing a power supply . Highly recommend .	1
Seagate has always been a very dependable product and I needed something to store my music and pictures on as a backup . It has not only done that , but it is still working without any issues . I love the data rate using my 3.0 USB port and it is very quiet and does n't get too hot when left running.I WILL purchase Seagate in the future ! ! !	1
Blazing fast USB 3.0 , nice design and runs very quite . Keep in mind that the 3 TB is allocated as a single volume and some devices like the Roku , PS3 , smart TV 's and so on will only read 2 TB maximum of data.To avoid this you 'll need to re-partition the drive and make 2 individual Partition.But since i am running the media center on trough my computer it wont be a problem .	1
4TB , works great , ~100MB/s . If you have a troubles make sure you do n't have a tons of USB devices , including hidden ones like a 5-in-1 on your printer you never knew about . Also , for long term use , remember this is still a mechanical hard drive , even though it is external , so pick a spot , and do n't move it ! A couple times year while its COMPLETELY POWERED DOWN is fine .	1
I 've had a few drives of this variety from Seagate . I use a couple of them as external backups , however I 've also found that they are fairly easy to use internally . If you poke around on YouTube , you 'll find a number of tutorials on how to free this HDD from its cage . It is n't the easiest or most logical process ... but you only have to do it once . There are basically a number of pressure points that need to be depressed and then the housing needs to be pulled apart . Once inside , there are a few screws to loosen and out pops a good-as-new HDD . You 'll need the requisite SATA cables , but once its plugged in , the computer had no problem seeing it . Just format it and you 're good to go . The drive has worked really well for me as an internal backup , the spin-up time is more than I 'd desire ( maybe 3-4 seconds ) but I also think I have the sleep setting set a bit too conservatively . So there you have it , if you happen to get one of these and need an internal drive , it 'll work well !	1
I needed more storage for photographs . The Seagate Backup Plus 4 TB external hard drive fills that need . For my needs , and to prolong the life , I only plug it in when needed . It is quick , quiet and fits very nicely in my office .	1
After at least 15 years of using countless Seagate drives this has been like all the rest , perfect . But I 've got to tell you ... I almost never use software for backup when it 's included with Windows already . When I used to use tape drives on my servers that was another matter , but for a desktop I took all the Seagate included software and put it in a folder in case I wanted it and I never have . This is my primary external for two computers in two homes to share and update files and both use SSD 's with internal Seagate storage disks and Windows handles that and scheduled backups to this drive just right . So think twice about using free , gim me software when the Windows you paid for may do exactly what you want just the way you want it .	1
I have this brand long time ago and start out 1TB now I have couple 2 TB and couple 3TB and now I am buying another 4TB for $ 129.the price is really good and the drive still work fine after few year .	1
Perhaps I overdo backing up my files but I feel comfortable with my system . Although I have less than a terabyte of files and programs , I back everything that is on my internal drives an additional three times ! I have read horror stories about one having a failure on their internal drive and then when they went to the backup drive , the files ( s ) were not there ! A second backup helps prevent this unusual situation . So I have two external drives connected to my machine . The third backup is stored in my daughter 's house . I live in a garden style condominium . What if there was a fire or the unit above me flooded and my computer and drives destroyed ? What if there was a burglary and the burglars took the computer and my drives ? I suppose I 'm over protective but I feel comfortable with the situation as I have it . As for built in and third party backup software . I have tried several and prefer to control my own backups . I backup at least daily . I trust Seagate . I have , in addition to this 'Backup Plus ' drive a 2 terabyte Seagate Expansion drive in use . Seagate drives are quiet and remain cool . Mine are connected to my desktop and run 24 hours a day . I can assure you that this Seagate drive is a well made product and handsome in appearance . Whenever someone asks me what drives would I recommend , I mention Seagate and Western Digital . I 've never had a problem with either brand and I have numerous drives .	1
I needed a desktop backup drive for my computer ( and home networked computers ) , and the 2TB size is plenty of room for all our photos , videos and documents . This Backup Plus drive came with Seagate Dashboard software with a 1-click backup process . I selected ALL files and drives to back up and let it go . The first time it runs , it makes a complete copy of all the files you select , which takes a while to do , about 1 hour in my case . From then on , it makes incremental backups , on a schedule you choose , of just the files that have changed . I chose to back up at 1 hour intervals.The backup process is uninstrusive and I have not noticed any computer performance issues while the backup is running , which is great . However , I have a couple issues with this backup software:1 ) It will not allow you to select any external hard drives . Since I store about 150GB of photos on an external drive , I have to manually copy those to the backup drive myself.2 ) It will not allow you to select other computers on your home network . You can still manually copy files from other computers to the backup drive , but the program will not do it automatically.I do like this backup software better than the WD Smartware software that came with myWestern Digital My Passport 500 GB USB 3.0 Portable Hard Drive - WDBKXH5000ABK-NESN ( Black ) , which was clunky and slow . But still , having to back up my networked and external drives manually to the Seagate Backup Plus is a pain.My suggestion , if you want an inexpensive total home backup solution , is to just buy an external backup drive by price alone , like theSeagate Expansion 2 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive STAY2000102orSeagate FreeAgent GoFlex Desk 2 TB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive STAC2000100 ( Black ) . Then buy separately some excellent backup software , likeRebit 5 Auto Backup Softwareor31207 Novabackup Professional V12 1U Boxor research Backup4All or Seagate 's Memeo software online . Or if you run Windows 7 , you can just use the included Windows Backup and Restore service . Do n't depend on the included software that comes with a ( cheaper ) hard drive as your backup solution .	1
. . . . . . . . . . . Fast and working well . will do a full review later..	1
Chuckle . The First Law of Hard Drives is : It is n't big enough.This is external drive number 4 for me . I have somehow managed to fill up 2 360GB , and a 1TB external drives in the last year or so . I ordered this because Winders7 came and told me it could n't do a backup because there was n't room on the 1TB drive . Sure enough , there was n't enough room left . I had not checked in a while , so it caught me off guard.In any event , this drive is your typical modern drive . Plug it in , turn it on , the Windows7 found it immediately and added it to the stable.It has the usual factory installed bloatware . DO NOT use Seagate 's backup software unless you want your computer to behave like a sick 286-33 machine . It uses nearly all of the machine 's ram to back up everything , constantly . The 'Seagate Dashboard ' is a memory hog that runs all of the time -- even when you turn it off.I found out about this stuff with the first Seagate external , and this time I just erased everything before I did anything else.The transfer rate is fine . Right now I 'm using 'legacy ' USB 2.0 , and wo n't have a chance to run USB 3.0 until the new desktop is built . When it is , it will be getting a workout , so I 'll add to this then.Oh ... and Winders was able to do its backup onto the new drive without sniveling and pouting .	1
Great for backups , slim and sleek . Sits in the corner and you forget about it . Fast too when you need to transfer a lot of data . I have 6 of these and have had no problem at all .	1
These are great but they tend to fail after 12-18 months . I 'm on my third one , so do n't keep your only copy of treasured photo collection on one of these . Do use it for daily backup , video or other big files that you back up regularly .	1
I wanted to say that most people do n't like buying expensive stuff like this online , because if you get it and don & # 8217 ; t work , most of the time the best you can hope for is a refund , no matter what & # 8217 ; s to go through all that . People do need to know something about enteral hard drives , specially this one . You have to hook it by plugging it in ac adapter , as well as have it plug in via usb while computer/laptop on in order to have it come on . I bet some of you bought this and thought doa & # 34 ; dead on arrival & # 34 ; I did buy one from the past online , not saying this or what seller , that does happen , but its normally rare . My advice to people is this if you ever get a doa thing try not to get mad . If it & # 8217 ; s a new one like the one I got , and if it is doa , and it has a warranty , being ie the serial , you can talk to them and get a replacement , because the sellers on here are n't going to give you anything other than your money back at best , doing this will save you lots of time and money in having to ship it back to the seller . Plus this advice will help show you there are other ways of getting what you want . I would suggest buying this being in terms of price and what it does . My best advice is this , make sure when you buy something , that you do your homework , and the sooner you find out if it works or not , the better chances you will get in terms of help . I check all my stuff the first chance I get it , ie soon as it comes into the mail , if you wait a month , then its on you , busy life or not . in terms of a refund or getting help for a replacement . Also I think if all possible a person should always get a backup of a backup . being a backup external hard drive , so in case your plan A does n't work , you have a plan b. I suggest backing up your stuff at least every 3 to 6 months , this was your prepared . If you feel 4GB To much try just getting two 2tb ones , that way you still get the same storage without the price being an issue . I hope this advice helps someone !	1
TheSeagate Backup Plus 3 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive ( STCA3000101 ) is a beautiful drive that stands up on your desk with an unobtrusive light and low volume of noise emitting from it . Overall , I am pleased with the device and its performance . I am also surprised at how inexpensive such a great product has become , because only a year or two ago 3 TB cost so much I did not even think to look at it . As you can see in the comments section for this review , the Seagate staff are knowledgable and helpful as well.EDITED : ( 1 ) My only complaint is that it is not especially stable , so you will want to put it in a place where it can not get knocked over.- A Seagate representative kindly wrote a comment to this review explaining that it can be placed on its side as well . That is good to know , though it is definitely not apparent that this is possible ( or recommended ) from the design along , which has no `` feet '' anywhere on the `` sides , '' and all of the illustrations show it vertical.EDITED : ( 2 ) Please note that this drive appears to be listed on Amazon less expensive than the `` Mac '' version , and it comes formatted for Windows NTFS ( read only for Macs ) , but it apparently has a Mac version of the Seagate software on the drive ( I did not install it ) , and it is easily re-formatted ( I recommend Ex-Fat ) for your Mac . Personally , I have nothing against the software provided by Seagate ( or any other company ) , but I am looking for a drive to hold my data , and do not need ( or want ) to go through someone 's interface . My rating reflects my experience with the drive , not the software.- The Seagate representative recommended that we do not use ExFat with this drive , as it has certain limitations ( I assume these refer to OS restrictions , possible problems with inadvertent disconnections , etc. ) . Instead , they recommended Mac OS Extended , or use of the bundled Seagate software .	1
Looking at the other reviews here , it seems this drive has some issues when using Windows backup . I already have an older 2 TB drive from Seagate ( Seagate Expansion 2 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive STBV2000100 ) that I 've been using with Windows automatic backup for about seven months and I 've never had a problem with it ( I 'm running Windows Vista 64-bit Home edition ) . Since I 'm going to keep using that drive for my automated backups , I ca n't really talk about similar Windows backup issues with this 3 TB drive.That being said , I 'm using this drive for media storage ( videos , pics , MP3s and FLAC files , etc . ) and it works great . I also use it to store large Photoshop and digital art projects while I 'm working on them . It really frees up space on my local hard drive . ( I do n't use this drive -- or any drive -- for long-term storage . For that , I burn to BluRay discs . ) I also have a couple of Seagate portable drives and they 've always worked well , too . I like the convenience of portable drives , but I do n't trust them as much as I do plug-in desktop models like these.I 've never used any of the included software apps , by the way . I 've never needed them . But I do save the included apps for all my drives , from this one down to small flash drives , in case I ever need them -- but I never have.All in all , I 'm very happy with this drive . I 've used it for about a month now with no problems . If I experience any issues with the drive in the future , I 'll come back to update this review .	1
Fine addition to my drive pool on windows home server 2011 . No issues at all , just plugged it in and the so picked up the drive . Would buy again .	1
Do n't bother with researching or checking out brands ... Seagate is trusted and it just works . Just try to get it on sale , making any procrastination useless .	1
EDIT February 6 , 2013 : I have been in contact with Seagate , and it was a slightly lengthy process to get a replacement AC adapter that does not make an irritating high-pitched sound , but today , I did receive one that seems to work just fine . It took eight days from my first contact with customer service.They recommended I reseat the power and USB cables at both ends , plug in directly to the wall rather than to a power strip in the first reply email , and in a later email even recommended I try another adapter to make sure it was n't the drive ... at my own expense : '' Thank you for contacting Seagate Support . I recommend trying another power supply to be sure the issue is with the power cord and not the drive . The specifications are listed below . You can find a power supply at any electronics store.Universal Power Supply , 12Volts 1.5Amp Output , Barrel Connection '' I thank Seagate for finally coming through with a replacement , but honestly , while the first couple of suggestions were reasonable , the last suggestion that I buy another adapter to make sure it was an adapter problem was simply bad customer service.___________________________________While this drive says it can be used by PC or Mac users , once hooked up to a Mac , it says it is not in the correct format . It is in NTFS format ( PC ) , but the drive contains software that is supposed to be installed to use interchangeably between PC and Mac.For users of either type of computer , this means using Seagate software to manage backups rather than the method provided by the OS used . For Mac users , this means one would not be able to use Time Machine.This is not acceptable to me , so I reformatted the drive , tossing the included software . Mac users must reformat using Disk Utility , to `` Mac OS Extended ( Journaled ) '' format.After doing this , the drive works great , but there is one concern with the device I received : The AC adapter makes a high-pitched sound when plugged in , almost all the time , and it 's very irritating . Obviously , the one I received is defective to a degree , but hopefully not dangerous . I will see if it is possible to get a replacement adapter from Seagate .	1
This Seagate Backup Plus is a solid option for an external drive for both PCs and Macs ( more on Macs later . ) With 2TB of storage , you can store or back up tons of files , and it is especially needed for those of us who have a lot of memory-hungry media on our computers . Because it stands upright , it has a small footprint , something I find welcome on my already cluttered desk . This 2TB version has an all-black , shiny plastic casing . The operation is quiet , and , so far , error-free.Mac users : Although this Backup Plus drive arrives formatted for Windows , it is compatible with Macs , although it must be reformatted to use with Time Machine . At the time of purchase , the Mac version was $ 10 more , so this one saved me . I could have used it as is to store files ; however , I wanted it to use as a Time Machine backup for my Mac . All I had to do with use the Disk Utility to partition and switch to a journaled format . Afterward , I can use it for both Time Machine backups and file storage ; the added folders are not touched by Time Machine backups . Be warned , however , that the entire drive will be erased when you do the initial reformatting . This Backup Plus drive is compatible with theSeagate Thunderbolt Adapter. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann	1
Normally I do n't get all that excited about an external hard drive however , I 've been surprised by how much I like this drive . Most of the computers on our network are Mac 's and for some strange reason network routers and external hard drive rarely make previsions for Mac support . The Seagate Backup Plus is different it 's ready to go on for use with a Mac out of the box.Pros-The NTFS file system that is on the drive can be used interchangeability with Mac or Windows at the same time . If you have a mixed computer environment like I do you will be exceptionally happy with this drive.-Fast USB connection ( USB 3.0 ) -Easy Setup-Thunderbolt compatible-7200 RPM Drive-Software suite that comes with the product is Social Media friendly . It will allow you to upload an entire album , if you wish , to a Social Network site with just a couple of clicks . I decided to not use the software because I did n't have need for uploading to sites but I wanted to test the function.- Large capacity . Nice Time Machine or Media repository.-Transfer speed . I was able to copy my old laptops 256 GB hard drive ( full ) to this drive in less than an hour over USB 3.0 . I 'd like to try it with Thunderbolt but the cable is pricy at this point.Cons-Upgrade to Thunderbolt is pricy-Software suite while good is a little flaky but nothing that ca n't be worked around .	1
I have 3 of these and they all work well . One of the three had a rash of read errors , but after reformatting no sectors were reallocated and more have occurred .	1
Been making this my main external drive and wow ... .for the price point I ca n't complain . The fact that it 's USB 3.0 is n't half bad although you 'll probably need a relatively newer computer to take advantage of the technology as most people are still in that middle ground using slightly older computers that have USB 2.0 . You 'll still see a noticeable difference in data transfer . This should hold most people down as far as having external space if the hard drive in your computer does n't already have enough space ( I 'm running about 1 1/2 TB of space and the extra 2 1/2 should be perfect for me . Would recommend if you do more than store music and photos ... .like movies .	1
This drive is used as part of a Windows 8 Storage Spaces array - think of it as & # 34 ; RAID-lite & # 34 ; .As such , there 's not much to say . it works . The price did n't break the bank . It does what I 've asked of it . It 's used for backups and redundant storage . The USB 3.0 interface means it 's VERY fast . I ca n't say anything bad about it .	1
I needed a large backup and I thought this one was the best buy for the 4TB and brand name.It comes with software to setup a & # 34 ; Dashboard & # 34 ; , also backs up to a cloud , and you can purchase 2yrs . or 3yrs . additional Product Protection and Data Recovery Service . Hopefully I wo n't need the additional protection and recovery service , but you never know.At present , it 's working great . I 'll check back in if anything changes.Donna	1
Well made external hard drive . Stands up vertically , but I 've also had it turned on it 's side at one point without issues .	1
I got this as a back up for my iMac . It is USB 3 , so if you do n't have a USB 3 plug on your computer ( I do n't ) , you 'll need a USB 3 to 2 adapter , as I did . I got the Cable Matters brand and it works great . This is a very solid drive , very fast ( backups are faster to this than my Iomega Zip hard drive ) , and has plenty of storage at 3TB . It has software you can use ( in a .DMG file ) but I trashed it because I do n't need or want it . I just want a place for my Time Machine ( Mac ) backups , and this rock solid hard drive fits that bill quite nicely . It 's the quietest drive I 've ever used . If it did n't have a light on it ( which only comes on when plugged in to the wall AND a USB port ) , I would n't even know it 's on . It also has four bars on the front to indicate how full it is , but there are much easier ways to determine how much space is left ( GET INFO for Macs , RIGHT-CLICK , then PROPERTIES on Windows machines ) .	1
have n't had as much luck with it as I have with WD ... crashed the second day after I loaded it with about 500MB . Wrote to Seagate and just got some really lame excuse not even worth remembering . Like they picked a pre-written response that came somewhat close to my problem . To me your customer care & response it half the value of the product !	1
I 'm getting close to 40mb/s over usb2.0 , so it uses up the whole USB2.0 bandwidth efficiently . I do n't have usb3.0 to test it out . I 've had the drive for 6 months and it 's under heavy usage , and has n't had a hiccup yet . Looks very clean . I did n't use any of the included utilities , and just used it as mass storage . The utilities allow the capacity meter to work , without them ( 5 led readout ) ; I 'm okay without extra lights in my theatre room .	1
So far no issues with the drive . The only thing I do n't like is each type of cable has a special cable that can only be used with this drive . It 's has extra weight than the standard .	1
I use this hard drive to back up my work computer . I use my own backup software . It works great , is fast , and have had no problems .	1
Low-cost products , plenty of capacity , power-saving power when not in use , usb 3.0 version because it seems faster . Noise small .	1
I have had this only for a couple months now but it is easy to install , just plug it in and start using . I 've had no problems and now have three Seagate drives on my desk all working properly . ( better knock on some wood , I 'm probably jinxing myself.. )	1
Overall , I 'm pleased with this drive . I realize a number of others have issues with the standard Windows backup - I would n't know , never used it , never plan on using it , but it 's a free product , and it seems a bit silly that Seagate would n't support it . Poor form , Seagate . For my review , however , this item gets 4 stars , missing a fifth star due to the weak software package that comes with it.Pros : - Quiet drive that runs coolly . It 's not hot to the touch after use.- Ample backup space , and no crashes yet- Cost is reasonable , and the unit itself is attractive enough , unlike the old external case I used to use , which was ridiculous.Cons : - Falls over easily , so it 's sitting on its side.- I would have liked a longer cable . This one is a bit sparse.- The included software is weak , at best . Seagate dashboard does n't compare favorably to the WD software I got with one of these drives from work .	1
With seagate taking the lead as most reliable drive brand , this drive running surprisingly cool and quiet and being fast on top of that , this was a no-brainer .	1
Nice and roomy , and surprisingly fast for external USB drive.Very happy with this one , and will be my first look when I need to expand space again for video .	1
Set this up as amy Samba drive on my network . Works great , seems solid , Very fast . Only owned one week	1
Not all that long ago , hard drive manufacturers would throw in a third-party junk application and call it a backup solution.Not anymore.The Seagate Backup Plus comes with well implemented backup solutions for Mac ( using Time Machine ) and PC , using Seagate 's Protect application . You can even upload to Facebook and Flickr and download from Facebook , Flickr and YouTube.The Protect software is well polished and flexible , which is a pleasant surprise . You also get a `` free '' subscription to Seagate 's Cloud service.The drive itself is a Seagate staple . It is not a speed demon , nor should it be . The unit has a USB 3.0 interface , which is backward compatible with USB 2.0 . You can also purchase Thunderbolt and Firewire interfaces.Overall , for those with basic backup needs , this is a nice setup . Remember , though , hard drives fail . I would be uncomfortable with only one backup , but that 's because I 've been working with this technology for more than 40 years . If something can fail , it will . On the other hand , working with this unit and your computer hard drive , that puts your data in two places which is far superior to no backup at all.I like this unit.Jerry	1
I have both the Seagate Backup plus and the slightly less expensiveSeagate Expansion 2 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive STBV2000100 , so I 'll compare them as I go along.This hard drive ( the Seagate Backup Plus ) comes with a 2 yr warranty ( expansion : 1yr ) , stands upright ( expansion : lies flat ) , and includes Seagate 's special `` Dashboard '' software pre-loaded on the drive ( expansion does not ) . Additionally , the Backup plus drive includes 1 year of access to Seagate 's cloud storage service ( only 4GB for free ; I 'd just skip it and stick with Dropbox , which I find more convenient , and which you wo n't have to pay for after a year ) .Speed : Using ATTO Disk Benchmark ( default settings ) , I got about 58 MB/sec write , 110 MB/sec read when connected to a USB 3.0 port . Using a USB 2.0 port ( same computer ) gave speeds of 27 MB/sec write , and 33 MB/sec read ( similar to my older USB 2.0 external HD ) . Actual file transfers will likely be slightly slower . Clearly , this drive is fastest when using a USB 3.0 connection . If you do n't have one ( and do n't expect to have one soon ) , there may be no point to buying a more expensive 3.0 drive , as any USB 2.0 external drive would provide similar speeds at potentially reduced cost . Note : speeds for the Seagate Expansion drive are identical to this one . Probably the same drive inside ( there 's no convenient way to open the case on either , which I find annoying as a tinkerer . Ca n't easily swap out the drive inside for another , etc ) .I have no idea how to get the optional Thunderbolt or Firewire adapters . No mention of them is made in the literature that came with the drive.Do n't format the drive when you first get it if you want to use the Dashboard software , as there is n't a convenient way to download it online . Which seems stupid to me , in case of accidental deletion . I was n't all that impressed with the software : it does three things , only one of them important ( my opinion ) . What it does well is automatically back up your data files . I have n't been able to find out specifically what it considers `` data files '' by default , as it leaves out system ( windows ) files . But it 's easily customizable to include just user-selected directories , and you can choose the backup schedule : continuously ( which I find handy ) , at periodic intervals , or only on command . It does n't just copy the files , but backs them up in a compressed form , so you have to use the Dashboard software to restore if needed . The other two things Dashboard does : downloads your social media files ( photos , video ) from either Facebook or Flickr ( no other options ) , or uploads files ( photos or video ) to either Facebook , Flickr , or Youtube . That 's it . Not especially necessary for most users.The drive does n't have a power switch ( my previous external HD does , which I found kind of inconvenient ) . Assuming it remains connected via USB to the computer , this drive seems to wake and sleep when the computer does ( same with the Seagate Expansion drive ) .My recommendation : if you just need a drive , get the cheaper Expansion drive , or any other USB 3.0 drive . Or maybe an external enclosure to put a drive in , for future-proofing . If you specifically want a dedicated drive for backing up files though ( and do n't want to deal with other software , etc ) , this one seems to do that well . Very easy .	1
I have this drive backing up a desktop computer using Acronis True Image 2014 ( Acronis True Image 2014 ( DVD ) ) . The computer it 's connected to is an older XP machine with only USB 2.0 - so I also bought an Anker USB 3.0 card ( Anker Uspeed USB 3.0 PCI-E Express Card with 4 USB 3.0 Ports and 5V 4-Pin Power Connector for Desktops [ VL805 Chipset ] ) . This whole combination works great for me.This Seagate drive hooked up and installed flawlessly , and works like a charm . It 's super quiet and generates very little heat . Using 3.0 , it is very fast ! I hardly even notice when my backup jobs are running.The only thing I wish is that I could lay it down on it 's side . I guess I really *could* - but it does not look like it 's designed to , so I do n't . However , this is a small issue , and not enough to reduce my five stars.I know that reliability is a huge factor when choosing a hard drive , so if I have any problems with this drive I will update my review . I have been using it for about two months now , and so far so good !	1
Great Drive - although its a little pricey - however AMAZON had the best price deal . So far the Super Speed USB to USB3.0 is working great . Have already created backup of 3TB on this drive of my existing data . The software provided has the ability to even take the backup of Facebook picture ...	1
When I originally reviewed this drive , I was pretty disappointed , giving it just a single star . However a couple of things have happened since then , and I 'm happy to report that my opinion has done a complete `` 180 . `` My original review is still below , if anyone is interested in the reasons I gave it such a poor rating . In the comments section ( below the review ) , you may also notice that Seagate provided me not only with a suggestion as to how to alleviate the terrible problem I was having , but also offered to address the problem further if it turned out the simple fix did not work . ( Given that I received the item at no charge via the Amazon Vine program , I was not expecting the same level of support that I would have , had I paid for it . ) The simple fix worked . Although my drive was plugged into one of the main USB ports on the back of the computer , it turns out that switching it to another port completely solved the speed problem that I was having . The result is literally like night and day . One example : I took a compact flash card that had 100 12MB images stored on it and plugged it into the card reader to upload the images to the drive . Before swapping USB ports , the 100 files would have taken several hours to upload . ( The transfer rate was literally down to about 50-100K/second ... it would take a couple of minutes to transfer each image ! ) After swapping to the other USB , the 100 files transferred in under a minute.One of the other reviewers commented that they could only utilize the drive as a `` backup '' device ; they could access their files only by `` restoring '' them using the supplied software . I have not found this to be the case . I 'm using the drive as I would ANY hard drive . I do n't ever store my data internally on my computer , so when I 'm working with images or graphics , everything is saved to and worked on directly from the external drive . There are no issues whatsoever accomplishing that with this drive.Given the blazing speed , flexibility of using it as you would use any hard drive , and the company 's very quick response to my negative review here on Amazon , I am happy to change this from a 1-star to a 5-star review.- Jonathan SabinThe original `` bad '' review ... . > > > I would really love to love this drive . It showed up as a `` Vine '' item just about the time that my existing Seagate Freeagent ( 1.5 TB ) drive was starting to act a little sketchy and I was therefore looking forward to having the opportunity to transfer the files over before the old drive failed.The transfer of files was , to say the very least , rough . At first I wrote off the extraordinarily slow ( ~500K/second transfer rate ! ) to the fact that my old drive was on it 's last legs . But now I 'm not so sure . It took approximately 4 days to transfer the 250 gigs or so of files to the new drive . And for the first couple of days , I was able to use and access the files.Now , not one week later , the new drive is toast . I 've attempted unplugging the cords and reconnecting it . Shutting the system completely down . I even ran an online Windows hardware fix program -- all to no avail . Every time I plug in the new Seagate drive , I am prompted that the `` USB Device is not recognized '' and to replace the drive if this continues.At this point , even if it were to suddenly start working , I 'm not sure I 'd even trust it with my files.I 'm giving it a one-star review . I suspect , seeing that most of the other reviews were significantly better , that I simply received a lemon.- Jonathan Sabin	1
Got this thing for $ 150 . Pretty good deal ! I was in need of a BIG Backup drive so I can backup my entire MacBook Pro as well as massive video projects that I no longer need to carry around on my personal travel drive.Ca n't get much better than this ! Doubt I 'll need another drive for a while ! Love the external storage monitor , letting you know when you 've almost got the drive full.Only had this for a week , but no issues as of yet !	1
No problems . Works fine on my Mac Pro . I use the Mac software for backing up rather than the Seagate software .	1
I am impressed with the amount of storage this drive provides . The disk has been quiet , reliable and an absolute pleasure to use . The included USB 3.0 cable is backwards compatible with older USB , and it connected easily with my Windows 8 setup . Cables for firewire and Apple 's thunderbolt are available separately.I love the design ; the vertically-standing encasement feels solidly assembled and it looks cool . So long as it remains reliable , I 'm very happy with both the performance and the tremendous amount of storage I get from the Seagate Backup Plus .	1
My setup on this hard drive is via my router and using this hard drive to do two things . One is for backing up two MBPs via wifi 24/7 . That will take 2tb . Another 2tb for my work storage to store my pictures and movies . I wanted to use that storage to be accessible at all times like pull one picture out of that storage and use it in Photoshop . Then save it into that storage and pull another picture to work with Illustrator and do the same thing everything on wifi network . It did not work smoothly . If you are planning to use it as a storage like I did , I would not recommend it . What happens is saved file will be broken or it just takes very long time to pull off the data from the storage . That 's because I am using the wifi network to access the hard drive . If you are using this via USB not via wifi/router , you should be okay . However , if you are using this via wifi I would recommend this product for strictly for backup only . If you need to access your pictures and movies every so often , I would recommend getting portable external hard drive that you connect the external hard drive directly to your computer using USB .	1
I tested this Seagate Backup Plus 3 TB USB 3.0 External Hard Drive on a Windows 7 Enterprise desktop system and can verify that this does n't play well with Windows standard backup and restore utilities . Now , you can MANUALLY bring everything over from your PC 's internal hard drive , but that 's not too much fun and sort of defeats the purpose of a lot of backup hardware and software.I actually was very interested in the included Seagate Dashboard Agent . Apparently you have to install that for the LED `` fuel gauge '' on the drive ( 4 bars of LED light showing how full the hard drive is ) which I thought was pretty cool . Also advertised was `` Save feature enables user-generated content to be backed up from your favorite social network . '' Well , it turns out that `` your favorite social network '' is restricted to only FaceBook and Flickr for downloading and saving , and only FaceBook , Flickr , and YouTube for uploading . Nothing about Google documents or any other `` social network '' site that I could find . The dashboard is NOT a fully generalizable social network offline/online synchronization tool . I was hoping for something that could back up all of my Google stuff , and facebook pics and vids as well as all the postings on my account ( maybe hoping for too much ) . Just being able to download my Facebook pics and vids ? I already can do that pretty easily.The cloud storage is restricted only to Seagate 's cloud storage.Still , the USB speed is about 4-5 times faster in data transfer ( not the 10x promised - that 's not unusual ) , and I found this to be a nice footprint for a desktop backup . I 've used some USB 3.0 single terabyte units that can fit in my pocket , but for 3 TB this sits nicely on my box . Others talk about a hum , which I can indeed hear pretty much if I put my ear next to it . This is still a pretty quiet unit and any ambient sound is likely louder.I give this 3 out of 5 stars taking one star away for unadvertised incompatibility with Windows 7 backup and restore , and another star off for the Dashboard Agent , primarily because the links to social network sites and the cloud features are just really limited in scope . Still , if you need to get and put up to 3 terabytes of data quicker than USB 2.0 , go for it.UPDATE : The Seagate folks responded to my review ( see comments ) and pointed out that Windows 8 's backup software CAN work without issues with this hard drive . I verified this on two of my HP Sleekbooks creating and saving 70+ GB disk images in less than 30 minutes . Windows 8 actually hides how to create a restore disk image in the control panel ( go to `` File History '' in the control panel and choose `` Windows 7 File Recovery '' in the lower left which will bring up the Windows 7 backup and restore facilities , including creating a disk image ) . Upgraded from 3 out of 5 to 4 out of 5 stars .	1
Being somewhat of an old timer who remember when tiny hard drives cost $ 500 , I am just so impressed with this drive . Vast amounts of storage and it connected perfectly to my Mac and acer netbook . I formatted it for ms dos extended so I can swap it around as needed . It connected perfectly and I leave it running as a media drive for iTunes and apple tv . No complaints .	1
Within moments of plugging into my Mac Mini it was up and running in minutes , transferring data is really quick . I just bought a new camera so now I have plenty of backup storage for the new collection of photos I will be taking . Nice and quiet I do n't even hear it running	1
... might only be a matter of a price differential.I already owned this drive , and it goes ( also ) by the nameSeagate Backup Plus 3 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive for Mac ( STCB3000900 ) . At this writing , the Mac version costs a bit more . Enough for a nice little trip to the local burger joint for you and your sweetie , perhaps . I say every bit helps , so do price compare . Whether you buy the one or the other , for PC or for Mac , both are loaded with the software for either . In the case of the Mac-marketed unit , we only needed to go to the Seagate site for HFS4WIN.I fully expect Seagate might have other flavors of this drive that are different merely in terms of software tweaking , or in terms of cosmetics . I like my older ( Mac-marketed ) drive better for our household 's PCs , because the casing is rubberized . To me , that means harder to drop , or fumble . And it has that silvery strip on the front . It is indeed that arbitrary.Well , there 's a small matter of the Mac version being formatted , as I mentioned , as HFS , while this unit is NTFS . Capacity-wise , that adds up to about a 30mb difference in favor of HFS formatted device.Whatever your pleasure , happiness is not having to choose between an external drive and `` the cloud '' for storing all those family pics and videos , but resting assured that you have a redundant backup on both sides . I guess I only wish these suckers stacked .	1
I 'm not going to go into all the technical details because there a lot of reviews that go over all this . My experience with this drive has been phenomenal ! I use it to back up my computer and all my photos and music . I have a 1TB hard drive and this expands my storage to 2 TB . I 'm a graphic designer so I do some extensive projects that require a lot of photos and artwork and just knowing that I have this drive to back up my system and to archive my older projects has been reassuring . The only thing I do n't like about it is that after a while it powers off and the drive will not show up under My Computer and I have to unplug it and plug it in again to power it back up . It 's really annoying but other tan that , I do n't have any other complaints .	1
I love seagate , and this ended up being a little cheaper than the comparable internal drives . So I got this and ripped it out of the case to mount in my desktop . Very happy with it .	1
This is maybe one of the best buys of the year . The price is great , USB 3.0 , great product . Recommended .	1
Has been solid and reliable formatted in NTFS upon arrival and has been working ever since . Hell of a deal .	1
Use this for my backup files and also to store Photos . Saves space on my Internal HDD .	1
This is what you want from a Desktop External Hard Drive , a large capacity , fast transfer rates and quiet operation . The unit is discrete and the Piano Black finish goes well along the same line of higher-end products . USB 3.0 is fast , I 've moved 7GB files within a few minutes and played them off the drive with no lag . Easy as plug-and-play to set up and includes some additional software from Seagate that allow you to set up automatic back up . You can unplug it and take it with you due to its & # 34 ; Book & # 34 ; design , but having to cary a power cord and connection cable make it more desirable as a unit that will stay on your desk .	1
There is n't much else to say about this . I have n't had any problems , and really enjoy having the added space . All my other drives are internal , so having one huge external drive is really handy if I need to transfer large files .	1
I wanted to wait a while before I reviewed this drive . I wanted to see how it would handle backups and constant use as my media drive , and it has held up extremely well . I did n't use the software that came with it , however . It 's nice , fast , quiet and sturdy . Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a relatively inexpensive external drive .	1
I have had this hard drive for 3 months now . It is connected to a laptop that I use to share media . So basically it 's been powered on since I first got it , three months ago . I 've used up almost all of the space . I have around 500 gigs free . I 'm thinking about getting another one when fill this one up . Great product for a great price .	1
I 've got lots of external hard drives , that I use mostly to store and back up digital video files , photos , music and such . I 've tried several brands over the years , but the one I keep going back to is Seagate . This one 's not really portable - it needs to plug in to work , so I use it on my desk . Like most of their more recent models , it 's got built in flexibility . You can replace the base with another one that Seagate sells in order to make it work with Thunderbolt or FireWire , instead of the USB 3.0 port it comes with ( backwards compatible with USB 2.0 ) . The Firewire base can double the speed , but on Macs that use it the Thunderbolt base is significantly faster.The BackUp software that this comes with is pretty useless on a Mac . All it does is upload files to social media sites , but it 's easy enough to do that directly from the sites . That 's fine by me , because I would n't use the software anyhow . I almost never use the software that comes with devices -- such as cameras , camcorders , printers ( except for the driver ) and hard drives -- but I did install it long enough to note that the only function I was interested in -- the capacity to sync up this drive with another , so that changes in one reflect in the other -- does n't work on Macs . I 've currently got another Seagate drive that I use with Mac 's time machine , so I 'm using this one as a backup for some of my other video files . It works great , and I 'm very happy with it .	1
I have 3 of these drives , serving as multiple backups of photos and media . It 's a really great backup drive but not without some shortcomings , specifically with the Seagate backup software . But that 's the only downside of the drive.The 3TB drive is pretty fast - but not fast enough to watch 3TBs copying seem faster . Using Teracopy , I was hitting 50Mb/s sustained writes from external usb3 to this drive . That was pretty slick . Copying from Mac to the drive ( using the NTFS drivers for Mac , which only seem to work on Seagate drives ) was just as fast . The drive itself is very quiet , even with hours of sustained beating with copying data , there was no drive noises . that was awesome.The Seagate Backup software that was included with the drive is pretty basic . There are better options out there ( even Windows Backup ) so I 'd see how well the included software/Seagate Dashboard works out for you and if it does n't meet your liking , there 's lots of free alternatives out there for backup.With 3 of these drives , I 've had zero problems . I 'm very pleased .	1
another from seagate , still worried about horror stories from other buyers but so far i gotten 2 seagate backup plus usb 3.0 2tb and 3tb with no issues i hope it continues that way and no surprises . and if they last then i will consider buying more seagate drives .	1
Although adaptor is available to use with the new iMac 's Thunderbolt connectors , the supplied cables proved a very fast connection via USB . The initial backup of my entire drive ( 125GB ) took less than 30 minutes and hourly backups are complete in a matter of seconds.Prices vary widely , so check around before finalizing purchase . Amazon was the best the hour I purchased this one.Well satisfied .	1
First , I should say that the capacity , according to the `` Computer '' function on my computer , is 2.72 TB . That fact seems consistent with the way hard drives list their capacity . I have a 2 TB hard drive with , according to the same function , 1.81 TB of actual storage . That drive , also reliable , is aWD My Book 2TB External Hard Drive , and it 's the one I refer to below for external HD-to-external HD transfer speeds.That said , I 've had no problems with this hard drive . I simply plugged it in , once to the wall and once to the computer , and it was ready to go . I have unplugged it from the computer several times to access the port for other USB devices , and when I plug it back in , the computer recognizes it every time . So far , the Seagate has been reliable in every way.Transfer speed directly from my computer 's hard drive is about 16 MB/sec . From another external drive , the speed is about 12.5 MB/sec.I 'm thoroughly pleased with this hard drive , which seems to be an excellent and easy way to preserve important files .	1
First Harddrive I received was dead on arrival , Amazon Quickly sent replacement harddrive and it works great & 3.0 usb if very fast doing system image on Windows8.1 system	1
I reformatted this to function as a regular external hard drive , which is slightly cheaper . It works great . I 'm very happy to have all the storage that it provides .	1
I tell people about the almost unlimited storage I have with this device . I can have tons and tons of music and video and whatever else I want on here . I can plug it in and turn it off with a proper more professional style 12 port usb hub I have . No need to turn the unit on and off on the unit .	1
This was a gift for my daughter she is real happy wit is and has had no problems with it	1
I have tried installing this drive on Vista and Windows 7 computers and encountered no problems connecting it and backing up files . The drive is quiet , does n't generate much heat , is very fast ( if using USB 3.0 ports ) and is a ready way to store and backup personal files.The Seagate Desktop software is a pleasant surprise . I can bypass it and simply use a file manager like Windows Explorer to store files , as I have with older auxiliary hard drives , but the Desktop provides very simple , user-friendly and options-loaded features . I can arrange for periodic , automatic backups , as this eliminates the I-forgot factor , or I can have a `` snapshot '' system where I order a backup on my own initiative -- or I can set it for fully-automatic , continuous backup so that revised or new files get backed up right away . The Desktop also provides means of backing up to the cloud ( one year free from Seagate before needing a paid renewal ) . The cloud , at least , provides for a place of storage that provides a measure of security : even if you 're diligent about backing up files , it 's not much good given a disaster that takes your house or even the neighborhood ( think , Sandy ) that eliminates your backup hard drives , DVDs and all that.The Dashboard also provides ready means of uploading pictures and videos to social media -- Facebook , Flickr and video to Youtube -- and vice versa . You may not have video or picture files on your computer that you previously uploaded , so Desktop does provide a quick and easy way of downloading ( from Flickr and Facebook ) and saving them , an added and unexpectedly useful form of backup . The software ( included in the drive ) include several videos , quick and upbeat , that will instruct you.I have tried connecting the Seagate drive to my router ( which has a USB port ) , so that it could be central on my home network , and found that I could indeed do it -- though that is more cumbersome . Be advised that your router ( e.g. , Linksys , Cisco ) probably will require you to configure the router to recognize this drive , which can be complicated , esp . for less-than-advanced users . It might not also provide the Seagate drive with the same protections as if it 's attached to one work station or computer : if a hacker gets through your router , your computers still should have firewalls , but a direct router connection might not . Better the simpler way : bring up the drive through one computer and access it from other stations via your network.One quibble is the unit itself : it has little rubber feet on one end to stand on , but no brackets or other mounting frames to keep it from falling over , and no drive should suffer that kind of shock . You can run it lying on its side , which may take up desk space , but you may find bookends to be more useful.To sum up : a drive that is simple to set up , very user-friendly to run given Seagate 's Desktop software , has ample storage space , runs fast and quiet , and provides you with good means of backup . Highly recommend .	1
This one works noticeably faster , and stabler than Seagate Expansion ( USB 3.0 ) . There is no problem with using it with Tuxera NTFS so you can use it for both Mac and PC . However , just as other reviewers warned , do not install any pre-loaded softwares . It crashes with other 3rd party NTFS softwares .	1
It 's amazing how much drive you can get for so little these days . I admit , I remember when a 30g drive was hundreds of dollars . The Seagate Backup Plus has been working well , so far . I have around 600 g on my computer and I set this drive up as my ongoing time machine backup . I did not use the included software as unfortunately , I 've also had problems using drive software and from looking at one of the other reviews , I see this is no different.It was basically plug and play on my Mac . I connected it to time machine , and it told me it needed to erase and format the drive for my mac , so I clicked okay and walked away . Seven and a half hours later all 600 g was backed up . I keep it on my desk ( it 's a desktop drive vs. a portable one ) and let it continually back up using time machine.I do 'eject ' the drive before I shut down my computer . You might be able to leave it going but after doing some research online , and finding a few cases of people having problems from just shutting down , I do eject it.I considered getting a firewire adapter which is sold separately , but could n't find one . Even on the Seagate site , it was not available . But , the USB is doing a fine job so at this point , I 'm set . So far , a good drive at a good price . Recommended .	1
This is the second 2TB Seagate Backup product I own . The hard drive is good at backing up video , music and picture files . I did not use the backup software included with this product ( because a software conflict with a virus scanner would not allow me to install it ) . So , I had to resort to the drag and drop/copy , cut and paste/method of transferring files . It does so quickly , easily and without a fuss.The only worry I 'm currently having with this device is that the HD is beginning to 'whistle ' a little bit . I hope this is not a sign of impending failure , and I have checked/defragmented it , and it seems fine , although the whistle sounds persist .	1
So far so good . I do n't know what people are saying about the compatible issue with OSX . I am using it right out of the box . Transfer is FAST .	1
I am happy with this backup harddrive . It is a good size ( physically ) for the type of back-up you keep on your desk and has enough storage space to cover anything I could possibly need . It 's speedy and does it 's job . I have not had luck using the back-up software advertised , so I would not recommend it for that , but if you just want to copy files for back-up , this works well .	1
This review is W7 centric , sorry.OK , 3 more hours to go to finish loading this 3TB drive . This drive will be media hub to replace my failed WD 2TB green `` MyBook '' drive that was a replacement from previous under warranty drive . Hey , they ALL go ; ) Pros : Fast reads from drive ! My fastest transfer yet from both my USB 3.0 laptops.Now cheaper : $ 110 , Aug , 2013 . Great for non critical data such as video and other large files . Buy two 1TB drives for critical back ups for non raid users . The base can be detached for interface changes , expensive ! The base can also be used as a `` Drive Dock '' for any brand of 3.5 '' or 2.5 '' drive . Any Sata drive is now Sata to USB 3.0 if you do n't have a case handy and for testing . The bare drive just sits up vertical on base . My two bases are also interchangeable if one base fails.Cons : Warranty now down to 2 years ... cost cutting Seagate ? These drives continue to run too hot during long sessions ! ! Not the drive to buy if you refuse to use 3rd party back-up software up for W7 ! I have been copying files for the last 5 hours . Issues are that one ( so far ) of my legacy programs , DVD Shrink , errors out when reading from this drive with 4k sector formatting.Heat : several reviewers claim heat not an issue . I beg to differ ! ! ! I have already recorded ( no fan ) 53C out of published max of 60C , during 2 hour recording session . Heat while in standby-idle , 44C , not an issue . I use small fan blowing on back of my two consumer drives during long read/write sessions for a max of 38C . I had high hopes to the new venting being more efficient over my other 2 year old Seagate GoFlex Desk.Although heat has been an issue of both my cheap Seagate and WD fan less cases , laying this drive on the side is a BAD idea by case heat riser design with no fan . Again , with fan , no problems . My drives live in a 74F/23C room for the most part.Not a bad drive for intended use , but , would never consider using one cheap consumer drives for critical back up . Most users would not be setting these up as redundant RAID but many ca n't resist the lure of cheap drives , no ? I prefer to span over two or more cheap drives which comes out rather inexpensive if you shop around . I also use the WD and Seagate enterprise class drives , 1TB when on sale , for work files . I can keep one drive offsite as well.I will report back if drive fails or errors during the year.ST3000DM001-1CH166 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Enclosure : Seagate Backup+ Desk USB Device ( V=0BC2 , P=A0A4 , sa1 ) Model : ST3000DM001-1CH166Firmware : CC46Disk Size : 3000.5 GB ( 8.4/137.4/3000.5 ) Queue Depth : 32 # of Sectors : 5860533168Rotation Rate : 7200 RPMInterface : USB ( Serial ATA ) Major Version : ATA8-ACSMinor Version : ATA8-ACS version 4Transfer Mode : SATA/600	1
BEST PRICE FOR CHEAP TB - USB 3.0 - WORKS FAST . WHICH THEY SEEMED HEAVIER DUTY BUT $ PER TB - THIS IS THE BEST DEAL ON THE MARKET .	1
USB 3.0 performance is quite good on this drive and it includes software for both Mac and PC so can be used cross platform . You can also use the included detachable drive dock to swap out drives of the GoFlex Desk ( now Backup Plus ) series . There is a standard 4TB , & # 34 ; green & # 34 ; internal SATA 3.5 & # 34 ; drive inside this unit , so that means two things : ( 1 ) you could pull the drive out and use it as an internal ( probably would n't have a warranty left though ) , also the SATA connectors ( power and data ) are exposed right through the end that plugs into the dock , so in a pinch you could direct-connect if you feel comfortable with that , and ( 2 ) this is n't supposed to be a portable drive . If you are looking for a drive to carry around , look to the 2.5 & # 34 ; / & # 34 ; portable & # 34 ; units , they are much better suited to the task of roughness and being transported.Overall , good speedy drive even for being a green drive . Runs much cooler in its enclosure than my 2TB version does .	1
Very simple to install , basically plug and play . No complaints so far . Gives me a lot of backup storage for raw picture files .	1
My daughter requested this external drive . She has a freelance graphics company and uses this to store her customer records .	1
Give me a choice and I 'll take a Seagate External Hard Drive EVERY time . I just love the instant `` back-up '' feature . I own two of these for my desktop . One of which is always on , and the other used once a month for a Full System Back-Up ... ... and then it is `` Un-Plugged '' for safety .	1
easy set up , mac likes it , no problems and good read speed . ( and i had to ad these 8 words )	1
I have two of these drives connected to my system to allow me to duplicate one to the other for backup protection . Both work awesome . Plugged right in and fired up on my Windows 8 box and they worked perfect . Very good drives for the price .	1
I recently ordered and received the Seagate Backup Plus 3 TB external hard drive from Amazon . It is very easy to set up , takes less than a minute or two to plug in two cords , one to the power and one to the computer . The computer recognized it and installed the drivers for it almost instantly , and I had my computer backed up in less than around an hour or so after unpacking it . Simply Amazing ! ! ! As for the ease of ordering this , paying for it , and the speed at which it arrived on my doorstep , incredible . Amazon has simply made my online shopping experience fantasic .	1
I am extremely overprotective of my digital files . I back them up on discs and thumb drives when I can , but I Always back them up on my external hard drives . And yes , that 's plural . I back up my backed up content , and then make another backup for those . All in all , there 's usually at least three 1-2TB drives with my stuff on them at any given moment , and a few more in waiting . I have all the major brands , Western Digital , Toshiba , and Iomega . This is my third Seagate and so far I like it even better than my older models . I find Seagates to be fast , quiet , not prone to overheating and so far no crashing . This latest model seems to hold up to my expectations . I 'm also pretty excited about it because it 's the largest hard drive I own - 3 TB is a lot of memory ! Here 's my pros and cons : PROS : - Fast ( but only Really fast if you 're using USB 3.0 . With regular 2.0 , it 's about average ) - Quiet ( So quiet , I sometimes find myself checking it to make sure it 's actually turned on ! ) - Does n't get extremely hot . Whatever cooling system Seagate uses seems to work . I 've had no problems with overheating with their products.- Strong casing . Though I always prefer the hard metal casing for my hard drives , the plastic on this model is extremely strong and does n't act like it could crack at any moment like the [ ... ] does.CONS : - Software . I understand that the software included with this is VERY minimal and not required at all for normal use . Its simply there for a few benefits , like automatically shutting down after so many minutes of non-use . For some , this is an added bonus . For me , I 'm superstitious and would prefer absolutely no software to be included whatsoever . It really is n't much of a worry , though , just do n't install anything if you are n't interested in it.Overall , I 'm extremely pleased . Fast , quiet , and cool are really the three most important components of an external hard drive , and this 3TB Seagate release fits the bill for me so far . It does just what it is made to do : store my stuff in a safe place . As long as it does n't crash on me , I 'll be extremely satisfied . I only wish it was cased in metal instead of plastic and did n't include any software at all . **NOTE : if I have any crashing problems or difficulties with this hard drive , I will naturally update my review accordingly .	1
Good hard drive . I use it for backup and it has not failed me yet . Fast and reliable . Great buy .	1
Good backup and got it for a great price Just wait until you see the prices go down before purchasing	1
My experience is hard drives has not been good . This product will well described and the dealer delivered in a timely fashion . I 've only had it a few weeks . Seagate is a good brand , so hopefully I 'll get a few years service before it too fails .	1
While I have n't experimented with the interchangeable connectors ( since they do n't come with the drive ) I appreciate the option . I 'm using a late 2006 Macbook , so having the firewire connector as an option is a welcome one . It 's plenty fast even over USB 2.0 , so I ca n't complain about that . My only gripe about the device is that the connector on the back does n't seem to seat snugly -- it always feels a little wobbly . I do n't think it would ever fall off , but the connection does n't seem as stable as I would like.It 's a good little hard-drive and it is providing a welcome home for our MANY digital photos .	1
I purchased the 3 TB drive for backing up my 15 & # 34 ; MBP which has a 750 GB HD for data and a 480 GB SSD for the system and apps . I reformatted the drive into two partitions and am using SuperDuper for the backups .	1
I have been using this primarily to backup my photography files . I do n't utilize Seagate 's propriatary software I simply drag and drop files from my `` C '' drive to the Seagate organized as I prefer . Since my photos are taken in the RAW format , each picture is about 25 megabytes , so it is important to store them in a reliable place being my Seagate 1 TB drive . It is reliable without exception .	1
The drive worked properly , it met my expectations . But it felt from the tower PC to the floor , about 60 centimeters , and it got damaged . It never worked again . I supposed that , as it was working when it felt down , the damage was in the disk itself . & iquest ; Should I expect that it was more resistant ? I do n't know . Anyway I bought the same one again .	1
I have had the opportunity to try out two different Seagate external backup drives , this model and theSeagate Slim 500 GB USB 3.0 Portable Hard Drive for Mac . They look very similar on the outside style-wise . The physical dimensions are also very similar -- this model is slightly thicker than the Slim model , but otherwise they 're pretty much identical in appearance.The performance is also quite similar . They both copy files plenty fast , and have a flexible interface option -- a USB 3.0 interface is included , but you can purchase an adapter to convert it to Firewire or Thunderbolt instead.One thing to note about this drive is that it comes formatted with the NTFS file system . Mac OS X can read the contents of an NTFS-formatted drive , but it can not write to the drive without a special driver . I did n't want to risk installing an untrusted driver that could cause system instability , so I just reformatted the drive with Disk Utility . It was fast and easy , and the drive now works great on my Mac for Time Machine backups . Highly recommended .	1
This product is a good example of good things come in small packages . It is as big as a cell phone , compact and reliable ... I bought this item to download and back-up thousands of songs / music in my library and they all fit on the drive therefore if you 're looking for something small that could hold your music collection I recommend this item .	1
Seagate in my opinion is simply the best external drive on the market . I have several and they all have great read and write rates and if you have usb 3.0 you 'll really love it . Took me roughly 10 minutes to backup my laptop . Great external hard drive .	1
I plugged into my dell inspiron 1525 with vista and it worked no setup or anything . I downloaded about 100 meg onto it and it took about 2 hours . I used microsoft backup to do it so that may have something to do with the time requirement . I have not tried to restore a file so have not idea how that works . When done I up it back in the box and put it away , I hope it works later .	1
It 's a wonderful disk . Especially becuase t 's compatible with both mac and PC . Great product.It 's fast , small , slim , silent .	1
nice and slim . fits almost anywhere and is a dream ! I have 4 for different requirements and needs . would recommend .	1
Ordered this product for my dad because he got a new laptop that had USB 3.0 and needed a safe storage solution .	1
I have been using this Seagate 1TB portable hard drive for a few months now , and I am happy to report that it is a good quality storage device . I was a little concerned when I got it because I have always used Western Digital storage devices in the past , but so far , I am happy with this drive.The true test of a portable hard drive is longevity , and unfortunately , we wo n't know how it holds up for several years , but as far as actual usage is concerned , I am happy with this USB 3.0 portable hard drive.It is a little bit longer in size than most drives , but that appears to be due to the fact that the entire area where the USB cord plugs into the drive can be removed for use with other connections.I believe this makes it compatible with Thunderbird and other uses ( for which I have no need , but I mention it because others might ) .The drive is quiet during operation , and I have not experienced it getting hot to the touch at all . The transfer speed is as expected for USB 3.0 ( fast ! ) , and it also works well with USB 2.0Overall , I think this is a quality drive and believe that it is a good purchase .	1
This was really easy to use . I 'm not technically inclined at all and I was able to get it connected and going in about a minute . My Mac recognized it immediately and opened the window for Time Machine so I could set my preferences . That 's it . Done.I 'm thrilled that we 're able to back up our drive . Once in the past my husband lost a ton of work and created music due to something he did inadvertently while updating the system . This should keep us from that . It will travel with us whenever we 're going to be away from home for more than a day as an emergency restoration should anything happen to our house or computer while we 're gone . That makes me happy.The drive itself is tiny . Just barely bigger than my iPhone 3 . It 's slim enough that I can slip it behind the monitor and not have to worry about it . The initial backup took a while , but it promises that subsequent ones will be faster . I do n't know why we waited so long to get one .	1
I 've probably owned a dozen `` portable '' USB drives in the last few years , but none have been as small as this one . At 3.07 '' x 4.91 '' ( 78mm x 124.8mm ) , it 's ever-so-slightly wider and taller than an iPhone 4S , but a hair thinner and a mere 20 grams heavier . It 's so small that it sometimes feels like the USB cord takes up as much space as the drive itself.The construction is solid , with a sleek black metal case that pairs nicely with Apple products . I keep this drive in my '' go-everywhere '' satchelalongside my13 '' MacBook Air . I try to stay `` high-speed , low-drag '' and do n't like carrying around anything bulky or heavy . This drive fits that bill and simply disappears into one of the smallest zippered pockets until I need it.The connection is standard USB 2.0 , with a micro-B plug on the drive-end . ( In other words , no proprietary cables ! ) As with almost all `` portable '' drives these days , it draws power from the computer so there 's no separate power cord.The drive does n't require any software or configuration when used with a Mac OSX device . Just plug it in and within moments the drive is visible in Finder . You 'll find a software suite pre-installed on the disk , but why bother when OSX already includes Time Machine ? At $ 99 at the time of this writing , this drive is a little slower and priced at a slight premium to some of Seagate'sotherdrives , but in my opinion the petite size is a more than equitable trade .	1
Got this to be the Time Machine backup for my laptop . It draws power from the USB 2 port and is relatively quick to perform backups . All I had to do was plug it into the Mac , select it as the drive for Time Machine and , like all Macs , the computer did the rest of the heavy lifting . The price for half a terabit of memory was good . It arrived on time and in good condition .	1
I do n't know what I can really say here . This is a hard drive . You should know what one is . It has 500 gigs of space . You should know what that means ( ie : it means that it actually has 465 gigs ) . It 's very thin , very lightweight , very portable and really easy to set up and use . I connected it to my PC through my standard USB 2.0 port and it works just great ! Beyond that ... what do you really need to know ?	1
This is exactly what I need in to external hard drive : small , high capacity , processes fast , and no bulky wires to power the thing . It runs entirely on USB , so you do not need to find an external power source every time you want to use it . It is as easy as plug it in and begin using . Granted , it does run a little hot , but I did not have a problem with it . There is more than enough space to back up my work files and store all of my downloaded material.Absolutely recommend to anyone with a computer .	1
I love this portable hard drive ! All you have to do is plug it in and it does all the work . Its small size makes it easy to transport and easy to store . Even the most computer illiterate person will be able to use it !	1
I plugged this little guy into my ancient Macbook Pro ( it 's like 4 years old now ) . I started up the Time Machine prefs , and chose the Seagate drive for the backup drive . In about a minute , the drive was beginning the backup procedure . I have a very large internal HDD , and a lot of big files , so the initial backup would take 2 hours . It 's about what I expect for that size of backup in any case , especially for a fist time running time machine.PROS : - Sleek and tiny . It 's smaller than my old WD Passport drive , and that one is only 300 GB . These drives seem to be shrinking every day , and that is a Very Good Thing.- Light . It weighs less than the old WD Passport , and my iPhone , and my headphones ( I have a pair of those biggish bluetooth headphones that go over my head ) . It does n't add any appreciable weight to my computer bag.- STANDARD micro USB connector cable . Unlike the USB 3.0 model made by Seagate ( same drive size , same everything else , except the USB 3.0 one is bulkier and uglier ) , this one comes with a standard micro USB cable . This means that when ( not if ) I lose the cable , I can just use the one that came with my headphones , my Kindle , my husband 's mobile phone , my husband 's kindle , my friend 's cables , etc . Very handy.- Did I mention it 's sleek and tiny ? Because it is.Cons : - ? ? ?	1
I love the physical size of this drive , but I think 500 GB is too small for using it for backing up ( I have a lot of pictures and videos , let alone music ) . The size is like a pack of those extra large post-it pads . Small enough to fit in my back jeans pocket , too big for my front.It was not plug and play with my older Mac , but it fired right up with my 2 year old PowerBook . I left it all day running , and voila - not hot at all . As I have only had it about a month , I can not yet say anything to durability ; however it is fast and quiet , which is reassuring ( or I should say hearing whirring parts is discouraging - and I hear nothing ) .I 'm not extremely thrilled with the price for the storage size . I think you can get more for the price , and right now I feel like you are paying for the size and aesthetics . Time will tell if the drive is durable , which would boost my opinion of the cost/size/value ratio.Bottom line : It 's very small and portable - if you need a drive to travel with , this is great . If you just want something for home , I would get something larger with more storage for about the same price point .	1
The hard drive is compact , sleek and fits nicely into your hand or your pocket . It 's actually thinner than my iPhone , although a couple inches wider.Its plug and play capability was outstanding . I was able to transfer files as soon as I plugged it in , without having to install any software or drivers.There is a software utility on the drive , the Seagate Dashboard . It took about a minute and a half to install , but does n't seem to do much other than some social media integration.In short , the drive is sleek , small , portable , fast , effective , and easy to install . Good purchase !	1
I am not a very tech savvy person . I needed to back up my files with minimal fuss , and this hard drive was a great fit for that purpose . It really is foolproof-just plug it in and it works.It is also ultra-thin just like it says in the description , and fits easily in any handbag , bookbag , or briefcase . Overall , I am impressed !	1
The Seagate slim is the thinnest , sleekest , and sexiest portable external 500GB hard drive you 'll find on the market . It 's a 500 GB drive and has a formatted ( NTFS ) capacity of 465 GB . The packaging includes the drive , quick start guide and USB3 A to Micro-B cable.The Seagate slim gets its power through the USB connection , so no additional plugs are needed.The performance of the Seagate slim is outstanding . Plugged into a USB3 connection It read a 10GB mix of files and folders at 62.2MBps which is tops for this category of drive . Next I copied a 2GB file to the drive from my high speed RAID0 in only 22.8 seconds , and after rebooting my PC and copying the same file from the Seagate slim to my RAID0 took a slightly quicker 21.6 seconds . Doing this same test plugged into a USB2 connection took 1:13 Copying to the Seagate slim and 1:05 copying from it . Using a benchmark utility called ATTO I test the full sequential read write speed of the Seagate drive . On USB3 the write speed is 113,263 MB/S and 112,316 MB/S Read . On USB2 the Write Speeds are 29,305 MB/S Write and 36,373 MB/S read . As you can see it is very worthwhile upgrading to USB3 if you do n't have that capability.The included Seagate Dashboard Software offers local and cloud backup support . It can also interface with Facebook , Flickr , and Youtube for uploads . A 4GB 12 month subscription to Seagate 's Cloud storage service comes included with the drive.Overall this is a great drive , very portable and provides excellent all around performance and versatility . The only downside of the Seagate slim is that you can get a comparable 1TB drive for not very much more . That said I give the Seagate Slim a 4 of 5 star rating .	1
Seagate Slim 500 GB USB 2.0 Portable Hard Drive for Mac is extremely user friendly , for Windows Users too . With its plug and play feature , I was able to be up and running , ready to store in a matter of minutes . Seagate Slim 500 GB Portable Hard Drive for Mac slim design is perfect for slipping into your pocket , bag or purse for extreme portability . I would recommend this device for anyone wanting a smooth running storage system that is very space-saving .	1
Feels very solid in the hand ; this drive is small and pocketable . Includes changeable interface connector to change connection type when needed . Transfer speeds are decent over USB2 with a sustained transfer speed of 25MB for over 140GB of mixed size files.The software to use this drive for PC must be downloaded separately , but works very well.Dashboard is intuitive and appears to provide a good solution for backing up social networking sites . Drive is very easy to install , too . Recommended !	1
I had been thinking of getting a backup drive for my Mac Air but dreaded a big hard drive with a little computer . Then I was offered this little hard drive with 550 GB . It 's wonderful . I easily used an ISB cord to hook it up to my hard drive to my Air and Time Machine came up and I was able to backup . And my information was really there ! Nice .	1
I 'm using this for my only Time Machine backup due to it 's small sizewhile I 'm displaced from my work studio.It comes in a nice black box ( for a gift just stick a bow on it ) . The actual drive is in a nicely finishedmetal enclosure . It is the thinest external drive that I 've used and although I haven'ttaken it apart I 'm almost certain that for the price it 's not SSD , but I 'm not positive as it'sincredibly light and very thin . If you are a business professional this is the perfect presentationexternal hard drive . Very `` polished '' and tastefully done.As soon as I connected it to my Mac Mini i7 I was asked if I wanted to use it formy back up drive , so I did . I 'm using this more as an experiment than a seriousbackup , but for right now I need space more than a bigger backup drive . I do n't storemy photo files on my computer drives , so for a back up for my MIni this is more thanadequate for my OS and all of my processing apps.It makes no noise and is very simply an external drive with an `` active '' light.The micro usb port on the enclosure is in a section of the case that can be pull awayfrom the main housing to reveal the SATA connectors , so if for any reason you needto by pass the usb and go right to the SATA connection that is possible.I 'll add more to this review later to report on the drive performance . So far it 's fairly quickconsidering this is USB 2.0 and not 3.0 , so the actual drive must be pretty fast . If it 's a mechanicaldrive this thing is amazing . Perhaps a larger micro drive that 's been updated by Seagate ? Actual enclosure Measurements are : 4 7/8 inches long x 3 1/16 inches wide x 3/8 inch thick	1
This drive is extremely lightweight and small but delivers nice transfer speeds and a good ( if not great ) amount of storage making it a perfect compliment to a portable computer ( Mac or Windows ) . For my Windows device there was some configuration that had to be done ( downloading and install of software ) , but overall it gave me exactly what I needed from a hardrive that I needed to carry with me .	1
I bought this with the intent to keep my new laptop backed up at all times . It came with a great bundle of accessories and was very easy to set up . The bundled software was useful to an extent , it just became bloaty after a while as it constantly ran in the background . I found the standard Windows utilities a much more pleasant alternative , if a bit minimal . The drive itself was beautiful . It purred in a premium way when in use and never heated up as other drives tend to . I do not recall the exact transfer speeds , only that they were slightly below what was quoted by the manufacturer . Size was incredible in both capacity and physical presence . The thinness was quite nice , a major selling point , if a bit gimmicky . An HDD that is designed to be portable is fiarly silly as HDDs are notoriously fragile . Having realized this fact , and that I had very little use for such a drive I returned it . I would assuredly buy again .	1
This is a great hard drive . It transfers fast , looks nice and sleek and works when it 's supposed to . I have n't lost any files as of yet ! One thing I like about this that I did n't about a previous hard drive was the cable connector . My older hard drive had a loose cable connector and that was a huge complaint in all the reviews . This one stays nice and snug when it 's connected to the computer.I do n't use the software ... just drag and drop .	1
This is hooked up to our airport express and it is fast enough for our needs . It is also very thin , like VERY thin which is great for not taking up space on a shelf or in a bag , but I would be worried about it cracking in a bag full of other stuff . It does have a short cable , but we have everything very centralized so it is not an issue for us but might be for others . It gets very hot , so be aware of that too .	1
This drive really is thin ! Plugged it into our MacBook and Time Machine came right up and we backed up the entire notebook in no time . Very easy . Attached it to the PC and just needed to install the HFS driver available on the Seagate Website . Then we could use the drive on the PC and Mac with no reformatted . There was actually a 128MB partition of unused space on the drive that I formatted as NTFS and put the driver on . Then other PC users could see that small partition and install the driver to see the Mac Formatted drive.Notes : - Works for Mac and PC . Just install PC driver available on the website.- USB end is removable so drive can be installed in network sharing device Seagate STAK100 FreeAgent GoFlex Net Media Sharing Device- Powered by USB port no extra power cable needed- Comes with USB cable- Formatted for Mac- Ultra thin and light- USB 2.0 and not 3.0	1
There is not a whole lot to say about a portable drive . I use them constantly and picked up this one as it is USB 3.0.Seagate has really slimmed these down . It easily fits in my pocket and runs cool to the touch . The drive was recognized by Windows ( XP and 7 ) and Mac OS X ( 10.7 and 8 ) extremely quickly allowing me to get down to business fast . As an IT person who sometimes has multiple irons in the fire at once , I can say it has been nice to have a compact fast recognizing drive to use on multiple operating systems.I would highly recommend this drive to anyone considering an external drive for work or home .	1
This is the smallest 500 gig hard drive I have yet owned . It is very well built and of good quality . It is fully backward compatible with earlier USB protocols and it can write from USB 2.0 at well over one gig per minute on multiple medium size file transfers ; that is quite good ... I have seen much worse , with bigger names on the outside of the drive.Overall , this is a great drive .	1
I had no idea that this hard drive would be so thin ! It is tiny and perfectly portable . Plus , it has 500 gigs of space ! I love this ! It is a prefect external drive for a laptop or other device . I have a mac and it worked fine with it , super easy to set up and use . It says it can be used by either a PC or a Mac.I 'm thrilled with this ; super portable , thin , easy to use ... . Mac compatible . A great little 500 gig HD !	1
This is my first portable hard drive . Nowadays with so much storage space needed for songs , movies , and general files , portable hard drives are the way to go . It is quite small measuring about 5x3 and is about the thickness of a pencil . It conveniently slips into the pocket of my computer case . Connecting the hard drive is easy with the USB 3.0 that is 2.0 backward compatible . It can be used for PC or Mac and comes with built-in software that allows you to backup information from Facebook , Twitter , and other social media sites . With so many people storing videos and pics of families on Facebook , that 's a handy feature . Inside the box , you get the drive , a USB cable , and the manual . There is an adapter on the bottom for the micro USB that detaches to let the user change out the micro USB port for Firewire or something like that . I do n't think I 'd ever have the need , but someone might . I 've already moved many files from my desktop , laptop , and online storage services . My grandkids like that I have movies available anytime on the drive . Great product for a fair price .	1
I got this drive because I needed a back-up drive . I saw that it contained software for Macs , which is great when switching computers , especially because it has a program so you do n't have to reformat it for PC AND Mac use.Drive is far smaller than I expected & certainly smaller than my old back-up drive ! Can easily fit in a laptop case side pocket , which is a nice perk ! Runs on USB 2 or 3 or Firewire ( it says on a Mac ... . I rarely if ever use my firewire , so don'y have a cable to see if it works on a PC , although I do n't see why when you can run it on a faster USB port.Great size to back-up a laptop , being somewhat larger than most out-of-the-box laptops , so you can back-up pics , family videos , etc . Great for average home user & for most work users , unless you 're creating animation or do a lot of videos , this is a great size ! Seagate makes larger drives for those that need that king of space , although if you 're doing that much intensive work on a Mac or PC , it 's likely you 'd want a 2+TB drive , and an SSD.No complaints here , perfect for my needs & I take a LOT of pictures & short videos in HD.Being able to switch from a Mac to PC & back was a great idea ! You can configure to make this a boot drive if you want as well - awesome if your laptop drive totally dies ! I 'd recommend this drive to anyone who thinks they might change from PC to Mac or vice-vera , or who works with others , say conducting conferences , etc . where being able to run presentations in either mode is important.Everyone should have at least their critical information backed up somewhere & this is a great , space-efficient way to do just that !	1
I am using this with a 5 year old MacBook . I have been backing up using the Time Machine software that came with my OS since I got the laptop , but not as frequently or consistently as I should . I share wifi with two other people , so backing up to our networked drive tends to take too long via air , and my previous 500 GB backup drive is too bulky and requires it 's own power supply.Thankfully , that will no longer be an issue for me . The Seagate Backup Plus is very small and lightweight , and powered through the USB slot on my macbook , so I 'm pretty much untethered , which was the whole point of having a laptop over a desktop , at least for me . I use a Belkin brand laptop pillow ( the `` cushtop '' ) for 99 % of my computing . The Seagate can stay attached via my macbook 's USB slot and I just tuck it into the empty space in the middle of the cushtop so it 's well ventilated but it stays attached . I tend to move my laptop with the cushtop , so it 's all one unit , and as I 'm not disconnecting or having to relocate the whole thing near a plug , when my laptop has it 's very rare moments of downtime , in order to back it all up and do it regularly enough that it will make a difference should anything malfunction.So , ease of use and no additional power supply make this way more user and travel friendly , definite pluses in my book.The software that comes with the Seagate Backup Plus seems pretty cool , in it 's description , but my first attempts to install it kept me from installing one of the pieces . I tried again and it still did n't work ... I wound up choosing custom installation and installed each of the components individually and that seemed to do the trick ( I knocked off 1 star because the error messages and the extra effort during installation where unexpected and irritating-I 'd rate the drive sans bundled software : 5 stars ) . I tried to use the Seagate Dashboard , but could n't see what extra benefit it would offer me compared to just using Time Machine . So I wound up not using it at all . Perhaps when I switch to a new machine ( eventually ) , I will reinvestigate it , but for now I 'm content using the drive as a plug & play backup drive , that is so far seamlessly compatible with my MacBook ( running 10.7.4 ) . For now , this old dog , is content knowing that her backups are effortless and speedy , and hopefully I never have to give my backup drive another thought .	1
I bought this AFTER i accidentally deleted everything off my Mac . I had no idea you needed an external drive to back up your files . I thought they were like PC 's , boy was I wrong .	1
Hard drives either work , or they do n't . It is not really possible for there to be a hard drive that store your data `` better '' than any other . Sure , some are faster , some are quieter , so I guess we just decide amongst those characteristics when we choose which drive to buy.This drive is small , simple , quite , and fast enough . Few of us really have any need for anything faster than this on a day-to-day basis . If you are looking for a drive that is small , sleek , and simple , I think we 've found your drive.The software was not intrusive on my Mac , and the drive works as expected . It is bus powered ( no required external power brick ) by a mini-USB ( not micro ) connector , and looks just fine next to my iMac . I 've been using it to store photos , music , and movies . It sleeps if I leave it plugged in , and wakes in a reasonable amount of time .	1
How much , really , can you say about a hard drive ? Well ... For starters , this drive is thinner than theGoFlex for Mac driveI reviewed previously , to the tune of over a quarter of an inch . It does n't feel as robust , but I would tend to assume both drives use a similar if not identical mechanism , so although the Backup Plus case is probably more likely to crack or chip , I doubt the drive inside would care all that much . Although it only comes with a USB 2.0 connector , the drive advertises Firewire 800 and Thunderbolt connectivity . While this is nice and all ( and Thunderbolt is probably overkill for anything short of a RAID array ) , Seagate does n't yet sell the connectors for this series ; fortunately , it 's mechanically compatible ( basically , standard SATA + power connector , plus retaining clips ) with the GoFlex adapters ( but not the other way around -- the Backup Plus adapter is too wide for the adapter bay on the GoFlex ) . As a portable drive , it does n't seem like the most rugged thing in the world , but it will do the job just fine . It 's HFS+ formatted , so if you were planning on using it on a NAS box you might want to make sure the box 's software supports it . ( You could reformat it , but why ? ) I have some misgivings about the software though -- it seems a bit buggy in its current incarnation , and although slickly designed it 's not the easiest thing in the world to figure out ; it does n't help that the documentation supplied on the disk is on video for some inexplicable reason . It does , however , recognize both of my Seagate drives ; however , and I ca n't decide if this is a good thing or a bad thing , it does n't provide partitioning or disk repair tools ( Apple 's Disk Utility should be sufficient , though one wonders what else Seagate could have brought to the party ) . It does install an NTFS driver , which might come in handy in a mixed environment . Also , one of its more touted features , downloading from social media sites like Facebook , seems to be not very reliable ; this will probably be fixed over the long run , but right now it 's kind of annoying , since it 's probably the one feature that makes the software worth having.It 's a fine drive , despite the somewhat iffy software . It 's thin and unobtrusive enough to fit in your computer bag , which is all anyone expects from a portable hard drive . Also , as I write this , we 're still suffering the aftershocks of the Thai hard drive shortage , so you do n't seem to be paying a premium anymore for the Mac formatting.Thunderbolt version update : Thunderbolt is a great technology , but it 's a little wasted on a single drive . If at some point Seagate creates a RAID version of this series , the adapter will be a sensible investment , but otherwise it 's an overpriced replacement for an extra USB port , especially at a $ 200+ price point . In addition , the adapter itself , while not obtrusively huge , is still quite a bit bulkier than the USB and FireWire adapters , somewhat negating the point of a slimline portable hard drive .	1
I found this to be a relatively speedy and compatible drive with both Mac ( of course ) and PC . I did not use the included software long enough to encounter any problems , and I reformatted it , so I am mostly talking hardware compatability.I liked the idea that you can remove the adapter and replace it with another , say like a USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt . This would allow you to used this across a wide variety of new and old machines as well as Mac and PC . Unfortunately , I found it impossible to find the adapters by themselves . So , in reality , it is practically just a USB 2.0 drive . I take off 1 star for this.However , once you remove the adapter , it is just an exposed SATA connector . Although the drive-side SATA is inset , so you ca n't really do much with it , the adapter SATA is a full-on portable SATA-to-USB 2.0 adapter . Very clever . I plugged it into a bare Intel SSD I had lying around , and it worked perfectly ( see customer pictures ) . I give it back one star for this cool ability.Next , I also have the PC version of this drive ( which is a USB 3.0 BTW ) . If you are wondering what you get for the `` Mac premium '' , the Mac version is made with a nicer aluminum case cover with real raised/machined logo whereas the PC version is just plastic with a painted logo . So , it would seem you are getting something extra , except that the aluminum cover is held on with cheap double-sided tape , and it wo n't stay down . Mine had an unsightly gap along one side . See customer pictures . Additionally , when I plugged the USB 3.0 interface from the PC version in , although it worked , the adapter did not align correctly and looked `` unfinished/crooked '' while at the same time , the silver cases of both ( one aluminum and one plastic ) did not match very well at all.So , reality is this is a fine drive if you do n't plan to change the adapters . Consider the adapter as an emergency-use-only bonus kind of deal . If you want to avoid the gap ( and save money ) , it 's probably better to get the PC version.BTW , inside , it is a Samsung M5 drive . Hope you found my review useful : )	1
I 've owned a Seagate External Drive before . This is a 1/4 of the size and appears to be quite efficient . I would recommend this item . Thanks !	1
This is a great hard drive . Incredibly portable and durable . I use it as a backup for my videos and it 's fast . The price is pretty good . Not as cheap as I 've gotten other 1TB drives . I 've gotten others for about $ 30 cheaper and have worked just as well . But that 's a small drawback . $ 94 is still a good price for a 1TB . I think this is a very good and stable hard drive . You wo n't be disappointed .	1
I used an ancient Lacie drive for a long time . This one is much easier to use and it 's all ready for Time Machine backup . I had trouble figuring out how to set it up because I did n't realize that USB 3.0 is backwards compatible.Fortunately , Seagate has excellent customer service . Once they helped me figure it out ( with a straight face , virtually ) I plugged it in and the time machine was effortless . It 's small so it does n't take up much room on my crowded desk . I think I 'll be buying Seagate drives for my future external drive backups . So far , so good !	1
As the product indicates , switch between Mac & non-Mac platforms is NOT reccomended ! That being said , this is a sleek and canny device , highly recommended ... for Mac : - )	1
I got this drive as an extra backup for ProTools music files -- while it 's not really big enough to provide a long-term full computer backup , it 's got a pretty good capacity for something like photo backups , etc . The size is quite small and portable , and like all of the Seagate products I 've had it 's quiet and reliable .	1
I 've been using this backup drive for a little over a month now . It works great ! I use this to backup all my photos while on my trip to Australia . It 's fast and easy to use . Just plug it into the usb port and go . If I had any complaint it would be it only has a usb 2.0 , that 's the only reason I did n't give it 5 stars . That said , it does what it is designed too . It looks nice and I like the feel of it . Small enough to place in a pocket .	1
Provides a very convenient backup for all information and applications on your computer . It retains all backups until the drive is full and then drops the oldest . After the first backup it only updates the files that have changed . Fast and reliable . Highly recommended .	1
I 'm using this Seagate Back Up Plus for my Mac MacBookPro . This works just fine and is very very quite . I like it .	1
The Seagate Backup Plus 1TB USB 3.0 Portable External Hard Drive comes with a suite of backup software ( Dashboard ) which allows it to be used as a dedicated backup drive with a Windows PC ; I got this drive to use with a USB 2.0-equipped Mac , with Time Machine , Apple 's automatic backup application , so I did n't need anything else . I got this drive to replace a Firewire 400 500GB drive that was my previous backup , and there appeared to be no difference in speed when backing up my main drive over the USB interface compared to the Firewire 400 drive.The drive is compact and quiet , and I detected no heat buildup - so I 'm thinking that is probably more energy-efficient than my older drives , always a good thing . I 'll come back and revisit this review if anything changes as my experience with the drive proceeds , but compared to the issues I 've had with the need to download and install drivers on Windows machine , the plug and play ease of operation of this drive with my Mac is refreshing .	1
These keep getting better and better . I 'm very happy with how much this holds , how efficient it is and how it works instantly with both my laptop and office computer.No complaints , just great !	1
4 1/2 stars.First of all , I believe every computer owner should have a portable hard drive . It 's essential for the safety of your data -- your music , documents , videos , and even programs sometimes . I have crashed many computers , but NONE of my portable/external hard drives have ever crashed . So much better than burning tons of CD-ROMs ( however , its always good to have a 2nd backup ) . It comes with software to make it easy to automatically back up your files . You can easily delete the software if you prefer.This portable hard drive is very small and takes up very little space on the desk or in any bag for transport . It is made of thin metal or plastic that you will need to make sure it is not banged around . It looks sleek and attractive , however the picture gives the appearance it is entirely silver and it is primarily white with a silver top-plate.It is fairly fast , just remember it is not as fast as USB 3.0 . It runs quietly and it is powered via USB . One thing i LOVE about it is that it does n't required a power outlet or double USB outlet for power . My main external hard drive uses 2 USB drives ( one for data , one for power ) and it is challenging to add more USB ports.Used this on Mac 10.6.8 and Windows 7 . Make sure you download the driver for the PCs . Remember to reformat ( Erase ) to MS-DOS ( FAT ) format to make it work on both operating system if you plan to do that . It works well on the windows.My only complaint is the USB cable that came with this is short -- around 17 '' so you can not put it back behind where you wo n't see it . I would love it to be twice as long at least.PRO : * Easy to use* Small and thin ! * AttractiveCON : * Short USB Cable* Thin case ( standard thickness for these size drives )	1
Works seamlessly with TimeMachine so far . Sleek , portable , looks good with my mac mini , relatively quiet ( though screamingly loud in comparison to my eerily silent new mini ... still getting used to that ! ) TIP : I thought there had been a problem with either this drive or my input port panel . However if you are having issues with an external drive or other plugged-in components , go to system prefs and make sure that under Energy Saver , you do NOT check the 'put hard disks to sleep when possible ' option . This was what was causing my difficulty .	1
I have a MAC and I was using an airport extreme , 1TB ... .with Time machine . Died for the second time , so I purchased this unit on the reputation of seagate . I literally took it out of the package , plugged it into my MAC . Clicked on time machine . It auto- discovered disk and asked me if I wanted to use it for back up . I said yes and after backing up my entire MAC main drive in a few hours , it now does regular backups . No noise , no degradation of system performance . Fits snug under my screen on the MAC bracket . Easy Peasy .	1
I 'm not much for reading instructions and in this day and age , I want the reality of plug and play . Meaning , I want to be able to plug in a device and make it work without any need for me to install software and go through a number of machinations to get a new peripheral item to communicate with my existing setup . If all you are looking for is an external harddrive that works as a backup , this product does exactly what it says . Out of the box , it is preformatted to work as your backup using the Mac software TimeMachine that comes installed with your Mac laptops.It has a Thunderbolt port ( but does not come with a Thunderbolt cord , only a USB cord ) for newer Mac machines.Seagate offers the ability to back up content from facebook or Twitter or other cloud storage services , but you need to install additional software . Do n't install the additional software if all you want to do is to back up your harddrive.The device itself is quiet and nice looking . It 's fairly heavy and is about 1.5 times bigger than an iPhone but it is still portable enough to place in a laptop bag if you wanted to use it for extra storage .	1
I have to admit I 'm biased about the Seagate portable hard drives . This is the third I 've owned . The first was an earlier version of this model . It worked like a champ for many years before I had to replace it because of software issues . My current drive connects via FireWire . While this is not the optimal connection ( sometimes I need to reconnect ) , the drive works like a champ.This drive is very small and lightweight . It connects easily via a USB port ( other connectors can be bought separately ) . I plugged it in , did n't install anything and the drive was there , waiting for my data . The Seagate dashboard software that came with it was easy to install.Having used Seagate Tech Support often I have to say they are great . Their Mac support staff actually understand the Mac ( a rare thing ) , do a great job of troubleshooting , and speak in normal English terms.If there is one caution I have about the drives is that when plugged into a USB hub it is likely the hub will go before this non-powered drive does . Often drive problems are the first sign of this because the drive ca n't draw enough power ( I know it 's happened to me more than once ) . If your drive starts not showing up , try plugging it directly into your computer . If it works , you hub is the problem.I 'm looking forward to may years of great service from this drive .	1
This Seagate Backup Plus HD for Macs is preformatted for use with the MAC OS and will connect and begin working right away . The drive is compact ( 3 '' x 5 '' ) and works off of USB power ( cable included ) , so it 's very portable . The Backup software is easy to use and will help you use this drive to backup whatever you wish to from your computer . If you expect to use it with both Mac & Windows computers you can download software for free from the Seagate website [ the URL is included in the installation guide ] to enable the cross-platform functionality on your Windows PC . You can also subsequently go into Windows disk management utilities to format it for Windows if you ever decide to use the drive only on that platform . The drive comes with installation and warranty info in multiple languages and it has worked fine so far . It is pretty fast connected to USB 2.0 inputs , while to get the full speed capability your computer needs USB 3.0 input jacks . If you want a fast and compact external storage drive this one is ideal if you expect to use it with a Mac - and it can be used with Windows as well , following a brief do-it-yourself update , so it is versatile in that regard . Note that this is assembled in China and that it needs to be disposed of at electronics recycling/disposal facilities and not placed in ordinary trash or recycling .	1
This is an excellent investment for anyone who is looking for a portable external hard drive . And , really , I do n't need to get all long and wordy . Quite simply , here are the reasons that it has worked great for me : * Fast . Load times are relatively short , even when I 'm moving a boatload of files . * Quiet . I do n't think I 've heard it make a sound . * Lightweight . I can carry it in my bag with me all the time and I hardly notice it . * Stylish . It matches my MacBook Pro because it has the same finish . This is not a big deal , of course , nor a breaking factor , but it is a plus . * Ready to use with Mac right out of the box . I took it out , plugged it in , and Time Machine started . It was a beautiful thing.Things that have not worked well : * Absolutely nothing . I have n't had a single con ( and I 'm hoping it stays that way ) .The lesson to be learned here : I would definitely purchase another Seagate hard drive , especially formatted specifically for the Mac .	1
This hard drive worked perfectly on my macbook right out of the box . all i did was plug it in and time machine was initiated and everything got backed up nice and easily . no hassle or frustration . wonderful hard drive for mac users	1
3.5 stars : The No . 1 thing I expect a portable hard drive to do is backup my files ( Mac OS X Lion , Time Machine ) quickly and reliably . The Seagate Backup Plus for Mac does this and comes in a sleek , attractive package . However , the Seagate Dashboard software is glitchy and does not backup Facebook or Youtube files as advertised , nor does it deliver on the advertised free cloud storage . This is not a deal killer at all for me , but I do think a product should deliver on its advertised promises . Thus , I am deducting one star . I am also deducting 1/2 star for the higher price point relative to similar drives with identical specs.PROS- Works with Mac Time Machine straight out of the box . To use with Time Machine , plug in the drive , go to Settings -- > Time Machine , and toggle `` ON '' to initiate backup . After the backup is done , toggle the switch off so you do n't get alerts to backup automatically every hour . The next time you need to backup , repeat the ON/OFF toggle process . Time Machine will back up only your new files to the Seagate drive.- Relatively fast transfer speed . My 110 GB initial backup clocked in at 1 hour and 26 minutes . This is 4 minutes faster than my other external HD , the Buffalo Ministation ( I tested them both to measure relative speed ) .- Light , aesthetically pleasing brushed aluminum and white plastic body -- very Mac-ish ( see photo ) .- Dashboard software is simple and easy to use , when it 's working.CONS- Dashboard software is glitchy . After installing , I got an error message saying the install failed . However , when I checked my Applications folder , the Dashboard had indeed been installed.- Facebook backup did not work . Youtube backup did not work . Of the three social apps , only the Flickr backup worked for me . I tried this 5 times over 2 days of testing , and got the same results each time.- Could not locate the cloud storage option -- the box and registration email advertises 1 year free cloud storage . However , there was no cloud icon in the Dashboard , as stated in the instructional email I received after registering the product . There was no cloud software download or menu item on the Seagate website . So , either it does not exist , or they have made it very difficult to locate . Like the Facebook backup , I do n't really care about this feature , but as a tester , it is certainly worth mentioning when a product does not deliver the extras it says it will , no matter how little you actually care about those extras.- About 15 percent more expensive than the 500 GB Buffalo Ministation Stealth at time of review.- Slightly larger than the Buffalo Ministation ( see photo ) .	1
I love this little drive for travel . Unlike most hard drives that require an external power source this one draws power from the USB cable . Just plug the included USB cable into the laptop and you have data and power . No external power dongles to carry . I use it for extra storage to move some bigger files to when my ssd starts getting full , and it 's not rocket fast but is fast enough for use as a normal hard drive . It is certainly fast enough to use as a backup drive , which is what most people will want to use it for . The case looks nice and is really small . Great product .	1
Seagate Backup Plus 500GB 2.0 Portable External Hard Dive for the Mac is perfect for me and my laptop . I need a place to store some of my old HQ photos that are taking up a lot of space on my computer . I have n't tried out any other storage features but it works fine for storing some of my older pics and files . If you are looking for an external Hard Drive for your Mac then you will want to pick up this in expensive device from Seagate . You ca n't go wrong with the price either.Highly recommended .	1
What I found to be the best feature of this hard drive was that Seagate formatted it for my MAC before I even got it . It is the first portable drive since I got my Passport Essental where I have just plugged it into my Mac , and it works right out of the box . If you see my history of reviews on portable external hard drives , you will know what I am talking about.I am using this as a back up for my Airbook , mostly for my over 9000 photos in Aperture . As I travel with my Mac Air , I wanted something small like the Passport . This drive is virtually the same size . It transfers fairly quickly too , transferring all 9000 photos in under an hour from my MAC.The drive includes some additional features on it for protecting images on your smartphone and social media sites . It has a video with instructions to do this , but Time Machine , ITunes and Aperture do this for me so I do not use this feature.This is what their website says about the Back Up Plus '' The Backup Plus portable drive for Mac from Seagate is the simple way to protect and share your entire digital life -- without getting in the way of the rest of your life.Mac OS and Time-Machine ready out of the boxAutomatically save photos from your social networksShare photos and video to social networks with a clickEasily increase transfer speeds by upgrading to Thunderbolt ( tm ) technology . `` As I stated above , no need for this with the apps and Time Machine already being used . But this price is competitive with Passport Essential even if you do not use the back up plus.I have had Seagate external drives for years . They are among the best .	1
if you have a mac , all you really need to do is plug this in and open time machine . the hard drive does the rest . it really is amazing how fast the fast the drive works ! straight forward , fast and easy to use , what more could you ask for with an external hard drive ? !	1
We live in an OS-agnostic household , so there are PCs as well as Macs that require backups on a regular basis . And , sure , perhaps hard drive storage looks relatively primitive nowadays with the prevalence of `` cloud '' storage , but , hey , sometimes Internet access is n't always available , and I still trust physical hardware to store important stuff in a pinch . The Seagate Backup 3.0 is ready-made for Macs , installs and is ready-to-use immediately . A great buy , as well , for the Terrabyte capacity for under $ 100 . ( Oh , and I completely agree about skipping the installation of the on-board `` bloatware '' - I never use any of that stuff , anyway ... )	1
I own a number of portable hard drives , either for back up or to store videos . This drive works perfectly for Macs with the Time Machine software . I prefer to use a portable drive rather than buying Apple 's Router/Time Machine combo device because 1 ) that device is overpriced and 2 ) reliability is better using the Apple router in its own.It 's not an exaggeration to say you take this drive out of the box , plug it in , and it just works . I am using it with the Airport Extreme router . I just plugged it into the USB port , set Time Machine to it , and it started . I like it better than the Iomega portable drive I had on it because it does not have an annoying flashing light , it 's smaller , it 's completely silent , and it matches the Airport Extreme aesthetically . I also own the LaCie Rugged drives , which I like because they feel durable for throwing into a bag and traveling . However , they are *much* larger than this Seagate , and not nearly as pretty.If you are looking for a low-profile backup drive that works simply out of the box with your Mac 's Time Machine , you can not go wrong with this drive .	1
This drive installed instantly with no hassles at all on a Mac laptop at OS 1.6 . I do n't have software to measure the speed but it 's VERY fast on large video files . Groups of smaller files are a bit slower but no problem at all . If you need an extra 500GB this is a cheap , painless and very compact way to go . BTW the unit is very small and light , perfect for a laptop on the go . NOT the usual brick of an external drive . The silver box matches current Macs perfectly .	1
I have two Macs , plus a laptop . I 'm also technically challenged to say the least , despite the number of electronic tools ( toys ) I have such as multiple IPads , etc . I recently backed up my newer Mac with an iomega . It took me some time and a couple of phone calls to more computer savvy friends but I finally accomplished the task . When I got the Seagate 500 GB portable External Hard Drive I first tried to set it up with my older eMac . Nothing happened and the fine print finally explained it did n't work on older systems . I then pulled out my laptop and hooked up -- and the thing worked instantly and effortlessly ! I did n't just `` get it working '' in a short time , I was DONE backing up my computer in a matter of minutes . I 'd like to think I 'm getting better at these things but the mini-fiasco with my first external hard drive was too recent for me to kid myself . The Seagate really is not only one of those things everyone should have ( and do for themselves ) but , for real , it 's one of those things anyone and I do mean ANYONE really can DO themselves . Technology for the masses ! I 'm impressed .	1
This product is so good and simple to use that it comes almost without instructions . You plug it into your Mac and drag your files to the icon that appears . Then you walk the dog for a while and when you return , all your hard work is safely backed up . This disk itself is the size of a small paperback ( remember those ? ) .In spite of googledocs and other cloud backup services , it 's both handy and reassuring to have a physical copy of your 'stuff ' .	1
The correct portable external hard drive for the use I 'm having with my Macbook Pro . Transportable , solid , silver aluminium , really fast as it has USB 3.0 , and very trusty for backups and also to manage big files of audio sessions . Great performance as I have it plugged all the time , it goes to sleep automatically after sometime of not being used , and wakes up in less of 3 seconds when you restart using it .	1
I am very happy with the form factor ( size of an index card ) for this 500 GB external hard drive . It comes with a USB cable ( no separate power cord needed ) & the speed is very acceptable . While it arrives already formatted for the Mac , I ran Disk Utility to format it into 2 partitions to use for backups . ( I recommend SuperDuper . ) The package said that Seagate does offer a separate Firewire adapter as an alternative to USB . The only way to improve on this product would be a HD case to protect it from dust & bumps & to easily keep the cable with it while traveling , so I purchased a CaseLogic one from Amazon .	1
This drive is extremely easy to use for Mac . I just plugged it in and Time Machine launched . If only all electronic equipment were this easy ! Not sure how long it will endure since I just got it , but the brand has a good rep . I have checked and it is regularly backing up my computer and the files it is saving are intact and open properly with no issues . I did not install the included software since I did n't need it , and apparently there are issues with Macs anyway . I will probably be purchasing a bigger version for my desktop computer in the near future .	1
It was nothing complicated . All I did was plug the USB 3.0 port into my iMac and it instantly recognized by Time Machine . I made about two clicks and it backed up my Mac without fail . Options are set on to back up once an hour , so I know I 'll my stuff will always be safe . I have another portable external drive for my HP laptop I have hooked up , that 's 500GB . I also use cloud storage for photos . But I do feel my stuff is safe just in case my computer ever crashes . I know my data will not be lost .	1
I 'm using this on a PC with Windows , so I ca n't comment on any of the MAC software/etc . This will work with a PC , you just need to download a little driver ( URL is in the box ) and you can use it interchangeable between the PC and a Mac . Or you can format it and just use it on a PC ... I chose to download the driver and see how it goes , and it works well . We 're using it with Vista on a laptop . The wife likes to edit old family photos , put frames and effects and stuff on em , and this is a great place to save and store the originals and her projects.No need for power , it 's powered off the usb port . It 's nice n small , pencil thin and barely larger than a deck of cards . It 's price wo n't hurt you too bad , the interchangeable feature , as well as no need for additional power makes this a damn good item in my opinion .	1
Great product from a great company . Son has a MAC and this is a great device to hold storage of all his legally downloaded music , etc .	1
This is the perfect storage for my Time Machine back ups . It could n't be much better for my purposes ! It plugs into any open USB port . It 's pre-formatted to work with Time machine . No finagling is needed to get it to work right out of the box.It 's fast little back up and is also very quiet when it runs , which for me is a big plus ! It works with Thunderbolt.Perfect and affordable !	1
So far , so good . It was an easy install and has worked beautifully with Time Machine on my Mac . I just hope that it keeps working ! A Mac specialist told me that external hard drives must be handled very carefully and never jostled to maintain their function . Just a hint !	1
This is a small , inexpensive external drive intended for backing up an iMac or MacBook , or perhaps for daisy-chaining off an AppleTV or Airport Extreme , if you have one of the models compatible with an external drive . It is quite small ( barely larger than an iPhone ; I will upload photos of it next to some other external hard drives for comparison ) , and has a subdued design . It is very simple , designed to be driven by a single USB cable ( included ) . It comes with a remarkably slick bit of registration software that detects the drive 's serial number so you do n't have to locate and transcribe the tiny numbers on the drive itself . The drive is totally silent while running ; there is no fan or vibration that I can detect.Some caveats -- the drive is not particularly quick , and you might not want to use it for anything but backups . Though the marketing material for the drive talks about using it with Thunderbolt or Firewire cables , it has only a USB 2.0 interface , and you are never going to get Firewire 800 or Thunderbolt speeds out of it . Finally , though the marketing material makes a big deal of the drive being `` Time Machine Ready , '' any drive can be used with Time Machine . 30 seconds with Disk Utility may be needed to reformat some drives , but it would be silly to pay extra for that `` feature '' .I would recommend this for anybody looking for a Mac backup drive who does n't need more space than this small format allows .	1
This is a compact 2.5 '' drive ( 1 terabyte = 1000 megabyte ) hard drive . It has a USB3 connector on the back and comes with the required cord ( about 12 '' in length ) . You can plug it into a USB2 socket on your computer if you do n't have USB3 plugs . I plugged it into the usb socket on my iMac keyboard , and it works fine . No need to plug it into a higher powered usb socket , i.e . the ones on the back of the iMac monitor . They also claim the drive can be used for Firewire and Thunderbolt connections , but I think an adapter may be required for this . ( Any comments on this ? ) It is quiet , and fast enough for most backup chores . It is claimed to be compatible with Time Machine , and I have no reason to doubt this . ( I have been using a 2Tb Seagate drive with Time Machine , and have had no problems ) .There is an unobtrusive white LED that stays on , just to show you the power is on . The case of this unit is a brushed aluminum that very closely matches the MacBook Air ( newest model ) . The design is clean and functional.The unique feature of this drive , is the included software called Seagate Dashboard . It provides two basic functions : 1 ) Backup your media ( jpegs , video ) from Facebook , Flickr , and YouTube ( Save ) . 2 ) Provide an upload utility for your Facebook and/or Flickr websites ( Share ) .I tested both of these functions , and ( to my surprise ) , they work quite well . First off , the software is easily installed , but does require a restart of your Mac after installation . There are 4 video tutorials that will give a good overview of the capabilities of the Dashboard app.I tried the Save backup function on my Facebook account . After asking me for my FB password , it logged on and began the download process . It creates a download directory automatically in your user directory , called My Online Documents\Facebook . All your jpeg and videos will appear in this directory . You can check a box to automatically backup any new photos or videos , without having to do it yourself.I also tried the Share function by uploading a photo to my Facebook account . Here , I think I found a bug . According to the video tutorial , it should have shown me my existing albums in FB and allow me to load the photo to one of them , or create a new one . I did not see my existing albums in the window , so I had to create a new one . When I did this , the upload proceeded . When I logged in to FB , I noticed that the photos were being 'held ' until I could Approve or Reject them , since a 3rd-party application loaded them . This is nice , on FB 's part , as a safeguard.Note that when I tried to upload a photo to my Flickr site , the software did show me all my sets in Flickr , and allow me to put my photos into them . So no problems here.I typically load my photos and movies via Aperture to Facebook and Flickr , so I really have no need for Dashboard . I also wondered why anyone would want to backup their media from these sites , since they are safe there . Well , if you have your original photos/movies on your phone , then there is a risk you may accidentally delete them and lose the originals . However , keep in mind that the backup versions that Dashboard saves , are the web-versions of your photos , and may be a lower resolution than your originals.As a backup drive , this unit is excellent and whether or not you use Dashboard is up to you . It is a well-designed piece of software that certainly makes it easier to upload media files to Facebook , Flickr , and YouTube . The software works surprisingly well and has a nice interface . Seagate did their homework on this !	1
Works on both MacBook Pro and HP desktop with no effort on the users part . Just plug into USB port . Love the convenience .	1
This review is based on a sample provided by the Amazon Vine program.This drive is sent formatted Mac OS Extended ( Journaled ) , so it 's a perfect Time Machine drive , but that 's not what makes it interesting . These drives from Seagate have the ability to change how they connect to your computer . The end slides off revealing a small module containing the USB port , and a standard SATA connector . Seagate sells replacements in many formats , including firewire and thunderbolt . Obviously you 're limited by the speed of the drive , but assuming you want to spend the money , you wo n't be limited to USB 2.0 speed long term.The other thing that Seagate includes is backup software . I did n't try the software.The price of these drives is competitive , and the future connection possibilities makes this drive a good value .	1
I love this little portable external hard drive . It takes up very little room with it 's small footprint and does exactly what it 's supposed to do . Seagate has your back ... eh hem ... has your back up !	1
I initially did not know that this drive was for Mac as I have only PCs . However , it was a easy converting it to use with Windows . The white and silver colors were obviously for the MAC , but my PC did not complain . This compact and sleek drive is fast and efficient . It has not disappointed me on anything . This drive is much quieter than my other back-up drives . Fast , quiet , easy and stylish .	1
This Thunderbolt unit is two pieces : the tiny drive fits into the portable Thunderbolt interface which then plugs into the Mac 's Thunderbolt socket . This allows one to easily remove the drive from the interface and replace it with new ones without buying additional Thunderbolt drive interfaces.Although 1 TB was once huge , today it is pretty much average for a good backup drive . But if more is needed , a swap to another drive is simple , straightforward , and automated . When plugged into a Mac running OSX 10.7 , it started up automatically , and with just a couple clicks began backing up the data using time machine . No other software is required . Sixteen minutes later , the 20 GB of data was on the new b.u . drive.It 's a bit pricey for a single TB drive , so this kind of speed may be better utilized as an active secondary drive . It 's certainly fast enough to feel like an internal drive ! ! ! So whether you want a fast backup drive or just more storage space 'cause your current drive is full , this unit will fit the bill .	1
I have been using Portable External Hard Drives for a little while now . They have added a few years to the life of my hard drives.From a programmer 's perspective these drives have been great . I use them for running 4 different virtual machines using VMware Fusion.USB 3.0 is a definite must though . They are slow as mud if you are n't using USB 3.0 . On the other side of the speed spectrum using my Seagate Backup Plus Portable Thunderbolt Adapter makes them lighting fast ! ! For digital image storage they are great . When we go on vacation I usually end up with about 7-10 gigs of photos.I guess the best thing they bring to the table is mobility between my PC at work , my work laptop , my PC 's and laptops at home , and my MacBook Pro . I currently back up and transfer all my work on them . I have both the USB adapter and the Seagate Backup Plus Portable Thunderbolt Adapter.The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB USB 3.0 Portable External Hard Drive for Mac and the Seagate Backup Plus Portable Thunderbolt Adapter are definitely worth the price . They have save me a ton of time going between different environments .	1
This portable HD worked flawlessly with my early 2011 MacBook Pro . My MBP internal HD was getting full due to my iTunes account and I needed an external drive to off load 435GB . So I purchased the Seagate drive based on reviews and my own experience with Seagate drives . I find Seagate drives to be high quality and reliable . With a 1TB drive I off loaded my iTunes to this external drive with the assistance of Apple Technical Support . Having a 2TB Time Machine and the MBP hard drive containing my iTunes , Apple Support was critical and extremely important to erase iTunes from both drives properly . I used the FireWire adaptor from my GoFlex drive , which worked perfectly , to transfer this large account . I have been using this drive dedicated to my iTunes account and has worked perfectly . I also have this drive backed up to my Time Machine . The only real concern about having my iTunes on this portable drive is losing it or stolen . You also must have this drive connected to the computer to access iTunes . I find this to be a minor issue . This is a great drive and highly recommend it .	1
I tested this unit in a variety of ways and am satisfied that it is a good performer . I breifly tested it on an older mac and it was recognized quickly . Transfer speeds are competitive for it 's class . I found it extremely quiet.Then I tried it on several PC 's . Initially , you must download and install the HFS driver according to instruction for it to work on PC 's . This is very easy to do and it worked flawlessly afterwards.There is also another way to work it on PC 's . I 'm not sure anyone would want to do this but you can remove the GPT protected partition and set it up for use on any PC . I choose not tell any more on how to do that , because ... well maybe you should n't if you do n't know how already . Besides , one should probably just buy a PC model if they want that much extensive use . Anyway , in the interests of testing I had to give it a try.Also , in the interests of testing I looked under the hood . It 's a smaller case than other USB drives I 've yet seen . The top is sort of glued or something , I 'm not sure what . I 've taken it off and on several times , but it 's still held there just as strongly do far . Must be something new . I do n't know how long that hold will last.Inside is a two and a half inch Samsung HN-M101MBB/AVN hard drive in the 1TB range . It 's a SATA converted for use with the USB interface , of course .	1
I am not going to go into all the technical mumbo-jumbo , because it seems like all the other reviewers already have . I will just say that Seagate makes some great drives that are extremely user friendly and reliable . This one is no exception . The speed is top notch and the quiet operation makes you forget it is plugged in . It is perfect for an immediate back-up at home or at the office and also makes a great traveling companion . It is small enough to slip into a pocket or small pouch inside you laptop bag/backpack . If you need to have a lot of data on the go , this is a great option . If you are smart enough to use a flash drive , you will be able to navigate this device with ease . Sure , the warranty is a little short , but so is the warranty for all tech devices these days . By the time the warranty runs out , most buyers will want something else ( they probably do n't need ) or your device will be working just as good as the day you bought it . No worries here ! Highly recommended !	1
It 's amazing how small drives have become these days , as this 500 GB hard drive is incredibly slim and compact . Obviously it 's bigger than a jump drive , but honestly it 's not that much bigger , and it has enough room to hold essentially an entire computer 's worth of info in something that will fit in a baggy pocket.While formatted for Mac computers , the Seagate Backup Plus 500 GB is easily used with a Windows computer without reformatting . Getting the device working with your PC is only a matter of plugging in , going to the Seagate website , and then downloading and installing a driver . After restarting the computer you 're good to go . It only took me about four or five minutes total to get the drive recognized on a Windows 7 laptop.The only downside here is the included cable . The device is formatted for a Mac , but comes with a USB instead of a Firewire cable , and the USB is amazingly short . Do n't plan on using this cable if your PC is situated underneath your desk , as the cable will never reach either the front or back USB ports . The only Windows-based computer the cable is going to be able to reach is a side port on a laptop , so plan on investing in a new cable if you want to hook up to a desktop .	1
I 'm not tech savvy and I hate reading manuals . A bad combination to use anything high-tech . But , I did n't need to worry about the Seagate Backup Plus . I just connect it to my Macbook Pro ( OS X 10.5.8 ) and it automatically started backing up Time machine.I have a Time Capsule , but I have to travel a lot . Now I can bring Seagate Backup Plus with me . It 's only a bit bigger than iPhone . Compact and sleek looking . I ca n't believe it 's so small . I really love it !	1
This drive works and looks fine to me , but its case parts are assembled weird . For example the small cover with white light is attached using glue and can be detached very easily leaving case with a hole ... But since for me the main thing is reliability - I am okay with it . The main thing is HDD which works perfect .	1
This drive appears to work very well , and takes up little space , both huge pluses in my book . The box was easy to unpack , and included the drive , power cable , Thunderbolt cable , and a users guide . I had it up and running in a couple of minutes . The Mac recognized the drive , and I was able to setup backups with no problems . I have n't tried it with a PC , but I understand it requires a driver to be installed . I do notice a slight performance degradation when the backups are happening , but that 's to be expected . All in all , a well made product , that does what it should with minimal fuss .	1
How much can you really say about a portable USB hard drive ? In this case , there is a bit to say because the drive holds a massive 3 TB , connects via USB 3.0 and brings plug in compatibility to external storage for both Macs and PCs . In my case , I received the drive shortly after a major hardware failure on one of my computers . I was able to quickly and easily back up the data from the damaged computer onto the drive using my Linux box . The backup completed successfully and I have had no issues with the drives performance . A quick note : to use the drive with a Windows machine without reformatting , you will need to install a device driver so that Windows will recognize the HSP+ file system .	1
The Seagate Backup Plus 3 TB Thunderbolt Desktop External Hard Drive for Mac ( STCB3000400 ) is another great addition to Seagate 's ever expanding line of high capacity Hard Drives that add value to what is becoming a generic device by adding the advantage of interchangeable interface adapters . In this example the popular and Seagate Backup Plus Desktop drive comes packages with a Thunderbolt interface adapter . Although this is pitched to Mac users , for now , and although `` Thunderbolt '' is associated with Apple , the technology is in fact an Intel creation and is owned by Intel . That means that Thunderbolt may be available for PCs in the future . A variation of the technology , using an optical interface , was recently added to certain Sony VAIO models.The drive exudes a good quality look and feel compared to the zillions of generic HD cases on the market for boxing whatever raw drives you may want to use . The slab sided Thunderbolt adapter creates a unique look for the drive in the desktop . It 's formatted for Mac OS out of the box , so is it 's compatible with Time Machine software . But it can easily be reformatted to NTFS for Windows PCs when and if they are able to work with Thunderbolt . The Thunderbolt interface is faster than the transfer rate of many of the drives that are connected to it . But for chaining drives together , like you used to do with SCSI drives , it 's a real advantage.As it is basically a Backup Plus HD with a Thunderbolt adapter the adapter can be swapped out with other Seagate adapters , such as for USB 3.0 or Firewire . That 's a good value added feature . It is intended to be used as a stand up , vertical enclosure , and has small foot pads on one of the short ends.Hard Drives are one of those things that work until they do n't . As of today , I am very happy with this unit . In ten years , or ten minutes , I may have a different idea . But I see no reason to think that The Seagate Backup Plus will not last a very long time in steady use and be a solid choice for all my backups . RECOMMENDED .	1
So far so good - the drive works well , and I was pleased that I could transfer my entire picture collection of about 500GB in less than 6 hours . I set this drive up for PC . All I had to do is follow a web-link on a provided inset from seagate , download a small file and install it , and then reboot . Without this process , a PC would not recognize this drive designed for MAC . With the price of external hard drives dropping , I would recommend having at least 2 external back-ups similar to this one for archival purposes . If you prefer burning DVDs or blu rays , Verbatim and Delkin have some great choices for archiving.Why not 5 stars ? I believe , like most hard drive reviewers , that WD My Passport drives are superior and more flexible , since they do not require an ourside power source .	1
I got this drive to replace a 1.5 TB drive that I was using for my Time Machine backups on my Mac . This was the perfect solution . It was already formatted when I received it , so all I had to do was plug it in and set it as my Time Machine drive and I was off and running . I really like the fact that is powers up with the Mac which the drive it was replacing did not . I have had no issues with this drive .	1
This is one of the easiest backup products I 've ever used . Once you install the software , it gives you the option to start your backup , with a default selection of backing up all your non-system files continuously . You can also customize the backup schedule.I ended up using this with a PC . When first plugged in , you ca n't see the storage b/c it 's formatted for Mac . The drive will show up , but it looks like it has no capacity . A simple download and install of the Seagate driver and everything worked fine.I like the backup management software . You can schedule multiple backup routines , and the software will also recognize multiple Seagate backup drives . Therefore , you could have continuous backups of all your files going to a large drive like this one , then have just your most important files backed up every day/week/month to a smaller , more portable drive such as theSeagate Backup Plus 500 GB USB 3.0 Portable External Hard Drive STBU500100 ( Black ) These backups and the drives can all be managed through the Seagate software , making it pretty easy to do.It does n't do version backups , nor does it say that it does bit-level backups , so I assume that any change to a file means it 's going to transfer the entire file and immediately wipe out the old one . Also , it does not back up the system files.The drive itself has 2 firewire 800 and one mini-usb connection on it . It only comes with the USB 2.0 cable , so if you want to use Firewire or Thunderbolt , you 'll need to have your own cable to do it . Using the included cable , transfers were as fast as could be expected from USB 2.0.The drive is also very quiet and has some basic LED indicators of how full it is.The only quirks I 've noticed is that it never really tells you once the initial backup is complete , and navigating within the backup software can be somewhat convoluted . The software lets you see the necessary info , but it 's not always clear on what you should click on to see it . Once you get used to it , it 's not a problem , and you should n't really need to customize much if you just want a simple backup performed.Overall , a really good product which was simple to set up and use .	1
Ok , this comes with a 3 TB hard drive . That is great because it means storage capacity and , being Seagate , a fairly reliable brand name as well . However , with the price tag you will wonder why a 3 TB HD is going for around 400 $ . This brings you to the real reason for your purchase -- or possible purchase . **Thunderbolt**Thunderbolt is a technology from Apple 's license that is used when transferring and writing data to and from your 'Mac ' computer . The Mac is in mini quotations because this technology currently only really works on a Mac computer -- a new one i.e . current models to 1-2 years old . Why should you want the Thunderbolt technology ? Only one reason : Speed . If you have heard of the new USB 3.0 and the speed increase from that over the 2.0 , the thunderbolt is comparable to that increase over the 3.0 . Although Thunderbolt is 'theoretically ' faster , you will still be limited by the hard drive itself . While using this thunderbolt setup with the included HD , you will be getting speeds very similar to those if you had the HD installed internally in a desktop.Speeds : From the 3 TB using Thunderbolt:130 mbps - Read150 mbps - Write**Interesting Note about the Cradle**When you remove the Hard drive from the thunderbolt cradle , you will have an open SATA port that can be used with any hard drive as you like . No need to take apart the external enclosure . The only downside to this is that it will be quite flimsy sitting on its head which will make it prone to tilting if hit with any pressure . This means , really , that the cradle will be a permanent addition to your computer for a while -- hard drive being interchangeable -- without voiding warranty. -- -Included -- -2 'Daisy-chained ' Thunderbolt ports on the cradle -- not the hard drive enclosure.A Thunderbolt Cable. -- -The price is very pricey because mainly this is a new type of technology and if you are buying this , it means you are an early adopter . For must uses you will not be able to take advantage of the top speeds of thunderbolt -- especially with the included hard drive . A situation where you might tell a big difference is with video editing while using a Solid State Drive . You will see faster speeds with this but nothing really different outside of having installed an SSD internally . I recommend the purchase if you must have every slight improvement -- speed here -- that you can get . If anything , you will be preparing yourself for the future -- however ; watch for price drops .	1
I had another Seagate back up which was 1 TB and it was not enough when I was backing up my computer . This 3 TB is just ideal and very easy to set up . Be careful when setting up for a PC and not a MAC as you have to configure other items to make sure that it will work the way you want it to . Also , I found that it is as compact on my desk as the other TB drive and it provides a safety net which I would have loved a few years back when my computer crashed . Get one and you will really be impressed at the ease and simplicity .	1
A sleek and neat external hard disk drive with ample room to backup the entire system via Time Machine and spare room to keep archives of photo , video , and other media . Bundled applications are simply unnecessary bloatware that does n't do much but bogs down your machine - skip it . I 'd recommend partitioning the disk before first use to separate Time Machine from your Archive partition . If you use this disk for both OS X and Windows platform , format the Archive partition as ExFAT and download additional driver for Windows to read the ExFAT partition properly . Go to download section in microsoft.com and search for ExFAT driver.Pros : + Sleek and neat external disk for backup and archiving.+ Preformatted and ready to use if you intend to use it for TimeMachine only.+ USB3 connection with backward compatibility with older USB2 ports.+ The 'dock ' is removable and can be replaced with Firewire or Thunderbolt connectivity.Cons : - Unnecessary bloatware applications . You have nothing to lose skipping it.- USB cable does n't fully plugs in to the USB port - it wobbles a bit .	1
Having reviewed a good number of hard drives , this time around , I am reviewing the Seagate 3TB Deskstop USB 3.0 Drive for the Mac which is compatible with the Mac OS X 10.6 or higher and Windows XP and up.I . WHAT 'S INSIDE THE BOX- Harddrive- USB 3.0 cable- Power Cable- InstructionsNOTE : It 's important to note that while a USB 3.0 cable is used ( and can be used on a USB 2.0 or 1.0 computer ) , Seagate does offer a FireWire 800 Adapter and Thunderbolt Adapter that is sold separately.II . FIRST IMPRESSIONSIt 's important to note that the black Seagate Backup Plus and the Seagate Backup Plus 3TB USB 3.0 desktop external are essentially the same drive but different casing . The regular version is black , while this Mac version has a silver section on the front . Also , because this is created for a MAC , no need to format , it will work outside of the box and your MAC will detect it.Unlike my other drive with a very bright blue light , this one is a very small white light . Also , it does n't have an on and off button . So , if you want the ability to turn your drive on or off with a button , this is not the drive you are looking for , especially if you really want to see green activity lights on your drive.It 's also a very silent drive compared to my which is a plus . This is a drive that can sit vertically or placed flat on your table.III . INSTALLATIONConnected the drive and my Mac detected it immediately . My primary goal was to use this drive as a Time Machine backup and to backup around 1TB of disk space . For every five minutes , I was getting about 6.40 GB backed up , so that was good.But this drive can be utilized for PC , you would have to reformat it but there is software included with the drive , otherwise , you can format it with MS Windows if needed.JUDGMENT CALL : I have had owned TB drives used as a maindrive . From Hitachi , Seagate and Western Digital . And my experience is that a lot of these drives start out flawless in the beginning but it 's later down the line where you start to notice some massive slowdown or glitchiness.Right now , having tested the drive for time machine back ups , graphics , web-based , video and 3D projects . The drive performed excellently so far.But within the next few months , I will be putting it through more intensive tests such as video and audio and 3D encoding to see how the drive manages to keep up as time progresses . And if any problems happens while using this drive , I will update this review.But for now , the Seagate Backup 3TB is working well as a backup drive and backing up via Time Machine worked flawlessly . So , I believe it would work amazingly well as a backup drive or a secondary drive for 3D , video , audio or graphic design work . As well as a drive for Time Machine backups . In fact , if you own a Mac and are looking for an external drive for that purpose and backing up files in general , this is a drive I can easily recommend ! Yes , it does n't have an on and off button and does n't have large status lights , nor does it come with a stand ( you can set it on its side but without something holding it up , I would n't ) . But for me , this is miniscule and what matters most is performance . But if it does mean a lot to you , you may want to look into the Seagate Expansion Drives or other drives in the same price point.User-friendly , easy-to-use , very quick , quiet and works perfectly . For its pricepoint for a 3TB drive , the Seagate Backup Plus 3TB for the Mac is highly recommended !	1
The reason I purchased this external hard drive is for the well-known manufacturer . This Thunderbolt was priced better than any other source that I was looking for in stores and online . I recommend this product to my friends . In addition , Amazon.com is a perfect place to find very reasonably priced electronics products .	1
This product is a 3TB external hard drive which is plugged into a plastic base that doubles as a stand for the drive . The plastic base contains a port for the AC line as well as two Thunderbolt ports . Seagate has a variety of these bases available , each with different ports : one model has USB 3.0 connectivity , another model has both USB 2.0 and FW800 connectivity , and the third , this one , has Thunderbolt connectivity . However , Seagate is making available only the Thunderbolt base independent of a hard drive ( so far , anyway ) . So it 's easy to buy the hard drive with the USB 3.0 base and a separate Thunderbolt adapter , but if you buy the Thunderbolt adapter/drive combination ( and that 's what 's for sale on this page ) , you wo n't currently be able to buy the USB 3.0 or USB 2.0/FW800 base separately.So make absolutely sure that you will be using this drive with a Thunderbolt capable Mac . Frankly , to have a wide range of current Macs with which you can use this drive , I 'd grab the FW800 compatible unit and then add a Thunderbolt base to my overall assembly.I configured the drive as a clone of my laptop 's internal drive . This was accomplished using SuperDuper on a MacBook Pro ( 13 '' , early 2011 ) running 10.8.2 . The entire process worked quickly and easily . The drive works correctly as a startup drive through the Thunderbolt connection . The startup speed is roughly equal to the startup speed of my internal hard drive . Running applications from the 3TB drive takes place with no obvious delay caused by the drive . There 's an improvement in overall speed when compared to FW800 , but for some reason I got nothing like the 10-fold increase in throughput that one should get in comparison , perhaps because of SuperDuper 's software design . The creation of my drive clone , with only about 200GB of files on the internal drive , took about 1.2 hours.The drive runs very quietly - the internal drive of the laptop is louder than the external drive . Neither is particularly loud . The drive generates a low amount of heat when being run continuously ( as during the backup process ) but usually is cool to the touch . The overall unit is small enough to travel easily . The AC cord includes five adapters to allow connection to multiple worldwide power sources . The box also includes the Thunderbolt cable . There are no directions or instructions beyond a very simplistic pamphlet . Backup software is included , but I did not take advantage of this.Addendum : I wanted to back up the hard drive of an iMac that does not have a Thunderbolt port . So I hooked this drive to my MacBook Pro , then connected the MacBook Pro to the iMac via a Firewire 800 cable , then booted the iMac as a Firewire drive by turning it on while holding the `` T '' key down . The MacBook Pro then saw two external drives : The thunderbolt drive and the IMac . I was able to make a backup of the iMac 's hard drive without difficulty .	1
I got this drive because it was thunderbolt and connected to by Apple thunderbolt display . It connects to the back and the drive is available anytime I plug my Macbook Pro into the display . this feature makes it very convenient to have time machine turned on . The only downside I have found is that you need to remember to eject the drive every time you disconnect your macbook or you get the nasty message about not unmounting a disconnected drive.The setup for this drive was very easy , just plug it in and respond to the prompt on if you want the drive used for timemachine . At that point the rest of the process was automatic . On a Mac I am not sure what the purpose of the Seagate software is , it looks like it provides a good application for windows machines and on the Mac it provides a mechanism for uploading your pictures and movies . I did n't find much use for this , so de-installed it after playing with it for a while.I noticed a significant speed difference between this drive and other USB 2.0 drive backup solutions I have used . It makes keeping a timemachine backup of your machine a very easy thing to do and no issues with waiting for it to complete.I would definitely buy this solution again , perfect for the job .	1
When I ordered this Seagate back up drive - duhhhh - I did not read the entire title , not realizing it was for MAC . I do n't have a MAC to backup I have a big desktop PC with tons of videos , pictures and presentations.Okay , the box came and said it was also for PC . Cool , I thought . AND there were instructions with TWO pictures to show you how to set it up - happy dance - do n't even have to put my glasses on . Got the drive plugged in and USB plugged in and the little light went on and it whirred to life.And then I spent 20 minutes trying to locate this new external drive . CRAPPP . I had to put my glasses on , I had to READ . lol . Okay , I had to read one sentence fragment . If you are using this drive with a PC , you have to go to seagate.support.com and pick up the windows driver . Download , install , reboot - and PERFECTION ! I hope I have saved you 20 minutes of frantic searching for an external drive . This process is always seamless with Apple products , I know , I know.I LOVE the texture of this drive , it has a very cool covering and I think it looks really sleek , too . It has a black soft rubberized cover with a nice platinum stripe in the middle - very techno sleek.The speed time to transfer video files - took about two seconds to move two mp4 files - VERY fast and I do n't have the super USB or firewire- just regular old USB and it was still REALLY fast . And it plays back off the drive , seamlessly as well.I am definitely going to keep this drive for a long time - close to 3 TB of space . A dream come true ! We all need more digital space , after all , do n't we ; - )	1
This is a high-capacity Thunderbolt drive . Thunderbolt is the superfast modern interface used in newish Mac models ; it supports displays and hard drives . The drive is set up with a passthrough , so you can connect both a Thunderbolt display and the drive to your single Thunderbolt port.The drive is attractive , quiet , and FAST - Thunderbolt is orders of magnitude faster than USB 3 or poor old USB 2 . It comes with some not-very-impressive addon software from Seagate , which you do n't really need . I recommend reformatting to get rid of the stuff.What comes in the box is the drive , the Thunderbolt base , a Thunderbolt cable , and a power cord.As with other GoFlex drives , you can swap out the base for a base that uses a different interface . I bought this to use with my non-Thunderbolt Macs , and it works fine : Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex Desk Desktop Adapter - USB 3.0 STAE106For Firewire and USB2 this one supposedly works , though I have not tried it : Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex Desk Desktop Adapter - Firewire 800/USB 2.0 STAE105Right now the USB3 version is much less expensive than the Firewire/USB2 version . Since USB3 is backward compatible with USB2 , I 'd recommend buying the STAE106 model for USB 2.0 machines.Okay , so the drive is large and fast and flexible . What 's the drawback ? Price , pure and simple . Only you can decide if the impressive speed of Thunderbolt is worth about $ 250 extra.For me , it would not be . I 'm happy to have gotten the drive through Vine , but the speed/cost tradeoff is not high enough for my non-graphic non-video needs to justify the price differential.Still , highly recommended if the price/benefit ratio works for you .	1
This review is to address the USB speeds of three different external drives . I use these drives for redundancy backup , mainly for my photography images . The drive I owned first is the Iomega eGo . The main reason I wanted to try out the Segate Backup Plus drives is because they can connect to either a PC or Mac using the same format ( the PC just needs a special driver ) . That way , I can swap computers and still have access to my same files ( note : my primary system is a PC running Windows 7 ) . Keep in mind that all three of these drives need to be plugged into a wall socket -- They 're not powered through the USB cable. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Iomega eGo -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- First off , let 's look at theIomega eGo 2 TB USB 2.0 Desktop External Hard Drive 34823 ( Jet Black ) . As you may notice , this is a USB 2.0 drive . It comes with 2 TB of storage at the current list price of $ 127.99 . You can connect this to USB 1.1 , USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports . A USB 1.1 port will slow the drive speed down to 1.1 . The other two will max out at USB 2.0.Connected to a USB 2.0 compatible port , the speed benchmark tests clocked at:1 ) Write Speed : 25.940 MB/s2 ) Read Speed : 31.329 MB/s -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Seagate Backup Plus 2 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Next we have theSeagate Backup Plus 2 TB FireWire 800/USB 2.0 Desktop External Hard Drive for Mac STCB2000100with 2 TB of storage . It 's currently priced at $ 149.26 . It comes with a FireWire800 and USB 2.0 cable . In addition , you can purchase a Thunderbolt cable ( only on Mac ) that claims increased speeds . Because of compatibility , I 'm only addressing USB speeds in this review . Like the Iomega eGo , you can connect this to USB 1.1 , USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports . A USB 1.1 port will slow the drive speed down to 1.1 . The other two will max out at USB 2.0.Connected at a USB 2.0 compatible port , the speed benchmark tests clocked at:1 ) Write Speed : 26.628 MB/s2 ) Read Speed : 32.072 MB/s -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Seagate Backup Plus 3 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Finally , we have the drive centered on this review . I acquired the 3.0 TB version ( 2.7 TB actual ) currently priced at $ 159.99 . It comes with a USB 3.0 connector , but you can also purchase a FireWire800 or Thunderbolt cable . It also came with UK and EU Input Plug adapters should you take it overseas . You can connect this to USB 1.1 , USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports . A USB 1.1 port will slow the drive speed down to 1.1 . A USB 2.0 port will slow it down to 2.0 . A 3.0 port will use the full 3.0 speed.Connected at a USB 3.0 compatible port , the speed benchmark tests clocked at:1 ) Write Speed : 26.156 MB/s2 ) Read Speed : 31.986 MB/sSurprisingly , the Iomega eGo performed best on read and write speeds even though it uses USB 2.0 . In fact , I was surprised to see how little the USB 3.0 speed differed over the 2.0 on this drive overall . In summary , there is n't really a huge difference between the device speeds , so pick the drive that works best for your situation.For those wanting more details about the tests , see the complete results below : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -Iomega eGo -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -* MB/s = 1,000,000 byte/s [ SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte/s ] Sequential Read : 31.329 MB/sSequential Write : 25.940 MB/sRandom Read 512KB : 17.688 MB/sRandom Write 512KB : 25.186 MB/sRandom Read 4KB ( QD=1 ) : 0.343 MB/s [ 83.7 IOPS ] Random Write 4KB ( QD=1 ) : 0.768 MB/s [ 187.5 IOPS ] Random Read 4KB ( QD=32 ) : 0.490 MB/s [ 119.7 IOPS ] Random Write 4KB ( QD=32 ) : 0.797 MB/s [ 194.6 IOPS ] Test : 1000 MB [ F : 76.0 % ( 1415.1/1863.0 GB ) ] ( x5 ) Date : 2012/10/24 12:30:38OS : Windows 7 Ultimate Edition SP1 [ 6.1 Build 7601 ] ( x64 ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -Seagate Backup Plus 2 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -* MB/s = 1,000,000 byte/s [ SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte/s ] Sequential Read : 32.072 MB/sSequential Write : 26.628 MB/sRandom Read 512KB : 21.696 MB/sRandom Write 512KB : 26.605 MB/sRandom Read 4KB ( QD=1 ) : 0.640 MB/s [ 156.1 IOPS ] Random Write 4KB ( QD=1 ) : 1.380 MB/s [ 337.0 IOPS ] Random Read 4KB ( QD=32 ) : 0.654 MB/s [ 159.6 IOPS ] Random Write 4KB ( QD=32 ) : 1.426 MB/s [ 348.1 IOPS ] Test : 1000 MB [ E : 1.7 % ( 31.9/1862.7 GB ) ] ( x5 ) Date : 2012/10/24 12:10:18OS : Windows 7 Ultimate Edition SP1 [ 6.1 Build 7601 ] ( x64 ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -Seagate Backup Plus 3 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -* MB/s = 1,000,000 byte/s [ SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte/s ] Sequential Read : 31.986 MB/sSequential Write : 26.156 MB/sRandom Read 512KB : 21.772 MB/sRandom Write 512KB : 25.865 MB/sRandom Read 4KB ( QD=1 ) : 0.628 MB/s [ 153.3 IOPS ] Random Write 4KB ( QD=1 ) : 1.381 MB/s [ 337.2 IOPS ] Random Read 4KB ( QD=32 ) : 0.652 MB/s [ 159.1 IOPS ] Random Write 4KB ( QD=32 ) : 1.397 MB/s [ 341.1 IOPS ] Test : 1000 MB [ E : 0.0 % ( 1.1/2794.2 GB ) ] ( x5 ) Date : 2012/10/24 11:52:13OS : Windows 7 Ultimate Edition SP1 [ 6.1 Build 7601 ] ( x64 )	1
Amazon shipped fast , arrived undamaged and on time , good jobby Amazon as usual . This is my third Seagate External drive that I own , and the first that specifically states `` For Mac '' on the box . Lets be honest , any drive is for mac , just go into disk management with any other external drive and format to work with Mac . Anyways , I plugged it in , and and came right up . I then copied about 30 gigs of movies to the drive , and it worked great ( no errors that others have stated as far as auto-ejecting ) . So far , lemon free with my drive . It is a slick looking drive that in my opinion looks nicer than the WD drives that this will be replacing . Thunderbolt speeds are super quick as well . Overall , Highly Highly recommend .	1
So far this is flawless I use it as the TIME MACHINE BACK UP FOR MY I MAC.Better than what APPLE SUPPLIES as this is 4 TB which gives it plenty of room as the I MAC Time Machine will back up only 3 TBso there is always plenty of space . It still only backs up 3 TB but with 4TB capacity it has the room to breathe so to speak.Not pushed right to the edge . Do n't know if that makes a difference or not but for the money I think it 's worth using instead of the MAC time machine .	1
I received this unit right as I was transitioning to a Mac Mini ( 2011 ) from a Windows PC platform . I was having some issues with the Mac so I decided to set up my new Seagate External hard drive as a bootable drive that I could use to not only reinstall my Mac primary drive but to also have available as an emergency boot drive should the issue come up again.On this front I was effectively thwarted when Mac OS X failed to install on the partition I 'd created for that purpose . Basically & # 34 ; Problems were found with the partition map which might prevent booting & # 34 ; . No amount of repairing , repartitioning or reformatting would correct the issue.So I sent the drive back for replacement ( Thanks Amazon ! ) and received a new drive which I immediately repartitioned into two 1.5 TB partitions and now I have one dedicated to Time Machine and another available for media backups that I may or may not need since time machine is working so well.The new drive works flawlessly . So I dinged the product 1 star for quality control which wasted some of my time but I would purchase another drive in a heartbeat ... provided there was a good return policy available from the merchant to protect my investment .	1
I really like these Seagate monster drives . At 3TB capacity they are large enough for just about any use , giving you plenty of storage space when used as the data receptacle for your `` Time Machine '' backups.The included software gives you Seagate 's `` Back Up Plus '' feature and enables switching between Mac and PC 's without re-configuring . The Seagate dashboard is included , making both storing and sharing your content between social media and email contacts a snap . The Thunderbolt connectivity allows a myriad of connection schemes and versatility with various device chains.The drive mounted instantly and shows 2.72 TB of usable space . Both the USB 3 data cable and the AC power adapter/cable are interchangeable with other Seagate USB 3 drives of this type . ( both included of course ) Transfer speeds vary with your computers bus speed or other factors such as feeding the drive from another external but overall I can reach an acceptable speed of over 20MB per second during an average backup . I have used this drive with both OS X Leopard and Windows 7 . So far , Windows 7 is balking at letting me use this drive for a system image backup , otherwise performs as expected . ( I am obviously doing something wrong here ) With more than sufficient venting on top , rear and bottom , the drive never actually gets truly hot . Also , operational noise is very very low , one of the quietest drives I own other than my portable mini drives . Build quality is above average overall and it feels like a very solid piece of gear . Looks good as well.Three Terabytes of storage for under 140 dollars would have been unheard of just a few short years ago . With decent quality , smooth operation and a nice clean look , the Seagate Backup Plus should be able to find a home anywhere there is a computer . Durability has so far not been an issue with my external Seagate drives and hopefully this unit will be no different.A good drive at a VERY good price . Many useful features and plenty of space . Recommended .	1
Seagate configures two versions of the 3TB desktop drive . I guess it 's only fair in retribution for all of the agony Mac users often experience in attempting to get windows based hardware to work efficiently in their environment , it is fitting windows users who for whatever reasons decide to reconfigure this drive for their setup instead of purchasing the dedicated unit get a taste of frustration.I have a hard time believing substantive differences in the internal components of the two devices exist but due to defined identifiers ( model and serial numbers ) windows users may discover initial installation of this unit could turn out to be a rougher ride than anticipated . I recently came into possession of a MacBook Pro but it is not a go to machine for me yet and I also already have aWestern Digital My Book VelociRaptor Duo 2 TB dual-drive storage - WDBUWZ0020JBK-NESNthat I will have to fabricate files for in order to justify it now , but I can always use another storage drive in the windows world.While I do not intend to use this drive for scheduled backups of any of my windows PCs I tested it in the PC environment to see how useful the dashboard software might be . The short answer is , if a PC user wants to maximize potential benefits from the marketed utilities , buy the windows version of this drive . Anyway , it is less expensive . Re-formatting and downloading the software from the Seagate website for use on the Mac version drive is a mediocre substitute.PHYSICAL FEATURESI find the 3TB drive sleek in appearance with its ' black rubberized outer surface and brushed metal strip . It is smaller than the Western Digital MyBook externals I own and noticeably quieter . Actual size is 6.2 '' x 4.9 '' x 1.7 '' and it weighs in at around 2.4 pounds . I know some users will look at the unit as a portable external however I consider it a moveable external . Portable in my opinion infers operation without separate power source and this drive is corded , with a space consuming wall wart , naturally.The one USB 3.0 port ( cable provided ) is backward compatible with USB 2.0 . Firewire and Thunderbolt adapters can be purchased separately . A power light and LED capacity indicator lights are located at the bottom of the front panel however the device lacks an on/off switch.Compared to my WD drives , I have more confidence the encasement of this drive could withstand those unavoidable accidental knock overs and in operation it is unquestionably the quietest drive I own , internal or external , including a couple of internal SSDs . I did n't open the case and Seagate is somewhat silent on exactly what is inside to the point I could n't state whether is it 5400 or 7200 rpm.CAPACITYAfter reformatting , the drive was left with around 2.7 TB of space , which seems like a substantial amount although I can tell you if pictures , movies and music files are being stored , it does not take too long to run out of room . My personal plan is to off load videos and MP3 files that do not need to remain resident on my NAS or home server but I can not bring myself to delete.SETUPEase of installation pretty much depends on whether it is used as delivered or converted to another format , in my case , Windows . The drive is shipped formatted HFS but is marketed as a crossplatform device . Yeah well , who really reads those blurbs about what to do so I immediately ported via USB ( 2.0 ) to a Toshiba satellite laptop with Windows 7 . Not surprisingly , the drive was not recognized but I 'm not the brightest flame on the candelabra so I tried again with a Dell Inspiron 530 with Vista and an ancient re-constructed desktop ( dell dimension 2300 ) with XP . Same results . I could n't even get far enough to reformat . After downloading a Paragon developed patch ( HFS4Win ) from the Seagate website ( support.seagate.com/crossplatform ) to each PC on the assumption I might at some point want to move this thing around , I was able to reformat to NTFS but I did not partition - I know somewhere in the future that will come back to bite me.The rub is in order to download the required driver ( and dashboard software ) the user is required to register the unit and enter the model and serial numbers . Yes , they are printed on the bottom label ( in Sanskrit as far as I am concerned ) and also resident in a file ... on the drive that obviously a Windows based PC ca n't read.DASHBOARDSeagate Dashboard is a utility featuring the capabilities to : - Manage data backups- Share pictures and videos with social networking sites- Download and store pictures from social networking sites- Control settings on the Seagate drive- Upload data to Seagate Cloud Storage- Disk Drive diagnostic TestingUNLESS , you happen to be a windows user with a 3TB desktop drive for Macs . Okay , any capacity desktop drive for Macs . The data protection menu is not available for Mac based units and since access to downloads requires a serial and model number , the website automatically defaults to the Mac version of dashboard when one attempts to get to the windows drive version . EVEN IF IT DID WORK , the dashboard utility is not designed to backup the windows directory , program files , system files or hidden files so if your system crashes you would still be SOL.I do n't do social media and I have a multiplicity of storage alternatives ( and paranoia ) ; I control possession of my own data across multiple redundancies ... like this drive ... and I can get to my own Home Server from anywhere ( fingers crossed since HP no longer supports it ) so the cloud option is not a factor for me ( or Mac users since it turns out the Cloud is not supported for Macs ) . Beyond that , the service is free only for one year for 4GB of data and I could n't decide which one movie I might want to upload.That leaves only settings control and diagnostics as features of any possible value . They are , to a point . Without an on/off switch the ability to define power savings periods when this unit is up is a benefit . The LED indicator lights may also be toggled on and off from the utility . Diagnostics , however , can be downloaded without installation of the dashboard.Additionally , anyone with existing PC startup time concerns will want to disable the software if you chose to install it . No reason to hang another application off the start queue . It has already crashed more than I am comfortable with on the older Dimension PC so it has been removed completely.BACKUPWell , the Seagate utility is off the table for PC users . Seagate acknowledges this unit was intended for Mac users to use time machine . Other reviewers have indicated that works well and I take their word for it . Right now I do n't have enough on the Mac to make a valid assessment . I could n't successfully backup to this device with administrative backup utilities in windows Vista or 7 from two different boxes , encountering I/O errors at around 50 % completion in each case . With a couple of different third party backup utilities , full system backup and image creation worked fine from each OS . No , I did n't try a restore ; I 'm not that brave when it is n't a necessity . Copy and paste of individual libraries worked without incident as well . I 'm not going to address speed because there are entirely too many factors in any individual environment for my results to be meaningful for another , particularly as I used a USB 2.0 port which is just about at the bottom of the interface capabilities of this drive.So , in my final assessment , the Seagate 3TB Desktop Drive may be a good option for Mac users who also desire to dabble in the windows environment but for PC users who think this drive can seamlessly accommodate their backup/storage needs , read the box carefully because there is a peer device that is a better fit . The missing user manual is also available in PDF format from the website .	1
A solid backup drive is essential for anyone who requires a decent backup system , and sometimes a RAID is not an option . I took the 2TB option and while it 's a good drive ( so far ) the cost difference between it and the 3TB drive makes it a less-than-ideal choice.This drive is set up as an external server backup drive which stands on a desk . My primary concern was power - would this drive have its own power supply or would it rely on power through the USB port ? As it turns out , it does have its own power supply which in my opinion is a very good thing.I do not have a Mac so the first order of business was to format the drive for ext3 ( Linux ) . This process took 4 hours over USB 2 . That 's a long time ! That said , it 's a big drive , and there were no errors in the process . It also confirmed something that was not clear on the packaging - this drive will work just fine with Linux , even though it is pre-formatted for Mac . In addition , this is a relatively quiet drive which is a pleasant bonus.I have not had this drive very long but so far there have been no issues with it . It seems to be reliable and stable , and that 's what is most important when using a drive for backups.Seagate has put together a nice storage and backup drive with this drive . That said , given a choice between the 2TB and 3TB drive , take the 3TB drive as the cost difference is so small ( presently between $ 10 and $ 20 ) .	1
I have been looking for a new 2 terabyte external backup hard drive with the new USB 3.0 spec for a while . This drive has exceeded my expectations , and I am glad I got it . The drive is well built , and the enclosure has a fairly small foot print compared to my older external drives . The drive is a nice glossy back , with small LED lights on the bottom of the front that indicated how full this drive is , a very handy feature . The bottom of the case snaps off revealing the direct power and SATA ports for the drive , and then the base could even be used as a temporary docking station for another 3.5in SATA drive . This is a great thing for anyone who has to pull hard drives out of people 's non-working computers to back them up . The software is actually useful , and it is simple to use . The software comes with the ability to store to the Cloud , and this is a good idea and all , but I ca n't really see people wanting to upload 2TB though their internet connection , I do n't . If you do n't want to use the software you can just delete it or just reformat the drive and it is gone.1 : VERSATILITY : While it 's nice to have , adding Firewire & Thunderbolt chips wiring and ports to the base package NOW costs money in hardware and licensing that you do n't want/need to spend . They give you USB now - every PC or MAC built since 1998 has one - and years from now if you want to make it a Thunderbolt drive or plug into a Macbook with a Firewire 800 port , you get the little base for it and plug the drive in.Manufacturing is all about tradeoffs and this is a sensible one.2 . GO ANYWHERE : READ from PC to MAC and back without formatting.3 . SOFTWARE : Having the Seagate Backup Plus 500GB Portable unit , I am familiarwith the Seagate Dashboard software . I like that it allows me to download all those pics off Facebook and Flickr that I have uploaded over the years . I also like the fact that Seagate does not force-cram it down your throat automatically upon install . Approved ! 4 . SPEEDY : ( USB 3.0 benchmarks : ) HD Tach had it doing bursts all the way up to 170MB/sec and ATTO has the drive rock steady at 85MB/sec on both reads and writes . For a 'green drive ' unit it 's fast enough for about anything you throw at it and there is nothing you could possibly store on here that demands more than this unit delivers . 2 GB video files ? Instant Open . Scroll through 1,000 TIFF files @ 100megs each ? Zooms right through it . See my other thoughts below for more.5 . ENDURANCE : Backups ( used to be ) a pain . You do n't just copy 315,000 jpg and RAW files totalling 1.57 TB at once from an old USB 2 external drive . I did . It took 18 hours . Then I wiped the source drive , copied it all back and then AGAIN back to the Seagate overwriting all the files on the drive . This was a 3 day torture test.The drive did n't even get warm.6 . QUIET : You ca n't even hear the thing . You put it right to your ear and you hear a faint hum . And the ocean . Ok , kidding about the ocean.This drive is easily my most quiet hard drive I have ; I can not even hear it at all . Then there is the speed of this thing , it is ridiculous . I have never seen a consumer hard disk that is this fast ; in fact this is faster than many enterprise drives that I have used . In most circumstances this drive will be faster than the hard drive in people 's computers . I got incredible speeds using a variety of benchmark tools , and using an OCZ agility 3 SSD to verify , I copied a 12GB movie to and from the drive , while timing it so I could get an average transfer speed . This drive averaged 155MB/s write , and 201MB/s read . I am blown away . This is seriously impressive for a consumer grade , and cost effective drive.Cons : The drive comes with a non-standard USB cable . However , the drive does work with a standard cable , but just not as fast . So I guess not all USB cables are equal . The drive claims to be compatible with Firewire , and Thunderbolt , but you have to buy an adapter , and it is quite expensive.Other Thoughts : The only other thing I would have liked to see included in the software suit would be the ability to clone hard drives . I know there are good free tools out there but it would be nice to have it all in one place.On a USB 3.0 port it 's as responsive as any internal drive directly connected to the motherboard . As a longtime user of external drives , I have noticed a delay in 'waking up ' so I can browse the contents once the drive has spin down . I have 3 external drives from other makers and it 's usually 7 to 15 seconds WAITING before I could access my files . INSTANT access on the Seagate Backup Plus 2TB . Impressed.If you work with BIG FILES like RAW Images in the 15+mp range or MPEG VIDEO , this drive is fast enough for anything you throw at it . While there are always higher performance and costlier options , if you have a USB 3.0 port , do n't be afraid to use this.Color me even more impressed . This drive is worth investing in a USB 3.0 card if you do n't already have a USB 3.0 port . It 's that good .	1
I do n't know why its taken so long for hard drives to reach these speeds but its very needed and most welcome . So far no problems using it after a few weeks .	1
i hate to review something like this after only a little bit of use . but this drive was very easy to set up on my MAC , and has been working flawlessly so far . as i mentioned , set up was plug in and use easy . the drive is fairly compact , and the look is apple like , so it fits in perfectly and discretely on my desk . there is no power switch , it wakes when needed . i use it primarily to store movies and RAW camera images , and have found the speed of the drive to be fine . i hope it continues to work this well .	1
Yes , it is a bit pricey . But with the size of RAW photo files , I needed to move up to a lager storage device and wanted to increase the file transfer speed at the same time . Since my computer has only USB 2.0 and Thunderbolt ports , this was an obvious choice - and thus far I 'm very happy with it . My workflow is to import and view photos on my hard drive , and then transfer the & # 34 ; keepers & # 34 ; to the Seagate . While I will often transfer them back if I later want to manipulate them , working with them on the Seagate with the Thunderbolt cable is significantly less painful than working with them using a USB 2.0 connection !	1
The Seagate Backup Plus 2 TB FireWire drive was easy to set up and there was no need to use the Seagate supplied software as the Mac already has decent software available.The Time Machine was a bit sluggish when backing up using USB 2 and it took most of the afternoon to accomplish this task . The FireWire 400 was tested and it was quicker than the USB 2 back up . We look forward to trying out the FireWire 800 back up and will update this review when this done.The Windows driver for the Mac 's file system , HFS+ , fromSeagate works well . I was able to transfer some data across to theMacBook from my Windows machine with it.It would have been nice to know how this drive operates and this was not included in the packaging	1
I have n't had any issues with the Seagate Backup Plus 3 TB external hard drive . It connected with my Mac flawlessly and transferred files without any hiccups . It 's easy to use and seems like it should stand the test of time . From my experience , I can give this a high recommendation .	1
The Seagate Backup Plus with the Thunderbolt adapter is super fast and easy to use with a Mac . The box comes with the hard drive and the adapter , along with a Thunderbolt cable . The drive itself has only a SATA plug ( which is used with the adapter ) . The adapter has two Thunderbolt ports.The hard drive and adapter feel sturdy . The hard drive is rather heavy and feels well built . Connecting and disconnecting the hard drive from the adapter is simple . The hard drive 's power is supplied through the adapter.When used with a Mac with Thunderbolt , this drive is super speedy for transferring files . The speed is mostly limited by the speed of the drive itself . I believe the SSD drives in the new Macbooks are faster than this traditional spinning drive . The main advantage of the Thunderbolt drive over a Firewire drive is the transfer speed . This drive is great if you transfer lots of data between computers or regularly back up large files.Considering the steep price of the adapter , I wish Seagate had also included Firewire and USB ports so you could easily transfer files between newer and older machines . You can buy the Seagate Firewire/USB adapter separately : Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex Desk Desktop Adapter - Firewire 800/USB 2.0 STAE105 '' > Firewire/USB adapter . Then , you can swap adapters back and forth when transferring between older and newer computers.For transferring between Windows and Macs , you can purchase this adapter separately : Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex Desk Desktop Adapter - USB 3.0 STAE106I purchased the latter and the drive fit in the adapter perfectly . However , despite installing the software that allows Mac drives to be visible on PCs , my PC still did not recognize this drive . The software worked well with my Seagate portable drive though , so I 'm not sure why my computer did n't recognize this drive . I was able to reformat it for use with PC , but what I really wanted was to be able to quickly transfer large files between PC and Mac.Overall , the Seagate Backup Plus with Thunderbolt adapter is a great choice if you are specifically looking to transfer large files . However , it 's not without limitations . Since the drive only has Thunderbolt ports , you need to buy an adapter to transfer files between new and old machines . If you can look past its limitations , this is a great device .	1
One of the things we all have too much of is `` data '' nowadays . From pictures , to videos to documents we just accumulating more and more of a digital footprint . If you are like me , you do n't want to delete anything because `` you never know '' when you might need it -- or for certain things , like photos , you want to preserve them forever.External hard drives have been around for a while , and they keep getting bigger and bigger -- but the problem is , they were always considerably slower than internal drives . If you had a lot of files to copy that were up there in size , you had a big wait in front of you . However , with this Seagate drive I was pleasantly surprised at how well it made use of the USB 3.0 speeds and how fast it was . Not quite as fast as my internal drives , but a heck of a lot faster than my older USB 2.0 drives ! One of the great features is that it has an `` at a glance '' storage indicator . Wondering how full the drive is ? Just look at the LED and you can tell if its `` 25 % , 50 % , 75 % '' or nearing the top . It 's a handy feature if you , like me , have several drives you use for external storage and fill them up as time goes on.It 's super-quiet operational wise , and even under a heavy load it did n't put out much heat and/or noise.Overall , a great drive with fast access times and with its USB 3.0 support makes it a must-have for those of you who have a lot of digital treasures you need to preserve for years to come !	1
With someone at home studying a career on graphic design , we had been looking into getting an external drive to add to the storage capabilities of the internal hard drive in a Macbook Pro 13 '' . While all drives may be formatted depending on your needs , it was a nice added value for us that the STCB3000900 came pre-formatted for Mac out of the box.Setting this up and starting using it was as easy as simply plugging the drive into a power outlet and then into the Mac , simple as that . Keep in mind this drive is intended to be stationary and while the size is compact enough to be carried around , the fact that it needs to be powered externally and not via the USB slots may complicate portability when used . So , after you connect the drive into the Mac all you need to do is find the .exe file which will start the installation process . The process will guide you through the backup and all the user has to do is follow the prompts . Once installed , a pop window will keep you updated on available space , backups and updates to the software . This is the first time we have used the software provided in one of these drives , I normally format the drives as we use them to drag and drop , not being a huge fan of backup utilities I have always preferred to work like that and keep my backups in order . This time though , being a student the final user , it was easier to install the utility and let the backups be made automatically . He backup process , which is triggered every single time you plug the drive into the Mac , is not as intrusive as one may have expected . Performance does not seem to be affected at all and the backups are done automatically and in a quick fashion . Every time a backup is done , the software automatically creates a folder with the current date where the backup is stored ( based on the sizes of the backup files and the time it takes , one could assume the backups are created from deltas , but I might be wrong about that ) With the automatic backup on , the user does not have to worry about saving files directly into the external drive ( though if it is a file you want to make sure is backed up you may want to reconsider ) The size of the files used ( psd , ai , indd files as well as hi-def picture files ) is quite large , which is why it is surprising that backups of about 34GB take minutes to be created.We have not had the time to experiment with the social media backups , while the idea sounds interesting , the main purpose of getting this drive was so we could backup our info as well as make sure we had enough room for the graphic design files used . While I have never been too fond of automatic backups , the software and the drive have been working incredibly well so far .	1
I needed a large hard drive for Time Machine Back-up of a MacBook Pro that is 1TB and an iMac that is also 1TB . Seagate is a known commodity in this field so the fit for a 3TB Drive seemed like a great fit . Once plugged in to the USB of my MacBook Pro , it showed up immediately on my desktop . When I set-up Time Machine , it began it 's work immediately and finished with no errors . Since then , I have also backed up my iMac and have nearly 1TB total storage on this device . It also appears formatted that it is indeed very close to a full 3TB of storage.Note that this device is not a small portable drive . Its about the size of an oversized paperback book and although you could travel with it , because it 's bigger it may be a bit more fragile . Also , it plugs in the wall and does not just use USB Power . I am now thinking of getting a 2nd one so that I can have one at home and one in a different location due to fire or flood . You ca n't go wrong with this drive at 3TB . The process for Time Machine to Mac was as smooth as you could imagine .	1
Came with a FireWire cable , and a USB , which is nice . Plugged into the wall then into my Mac Mini and had Time Machine set up in a couple minutes . Wo n't be using the social networking backup stuff . The whole marketing spin on that is just odd . Easy as pie.Update : Ended up getting the 3TB for another member of the family . Used it later for backing up and installing Lion on a laptop running Snow Leopard . Digging the speed and utility of this line .	1
So far it 's doing the job which is great because my computer was so over-loaded it was running about as fast as a faucet in Michigan in January . Using this could n't be any easier unless you could just tell it which files to copy over . We 'll see how good it really is when I need to access those files again . Just to be safe , they are also stored in the Cloud .	1
Does what it 's supposed to . Transfers are quick via USB 3.0 . It 's a good deal for a hundred bucks or so .	1
I am so computer illiterate it 's pathetic . I have a new MacBook Pro and I have n't even made a dent in learning about all the wonderful things it can do . What I do know is that I am able to store lots of music , pictures , videos and documents . I am constantly worried that my computer will crash and I 'll lose everything . My brother hooked up this Seagate Backup Plus to my computer and my worries have gone out the window.I 'm not sure how this works but I am just glad to have it . My brother says that this has excellent storage capability . I guess 3 TB is really spectacular . I 'll take his word for it . I know that we have backed up all my stuff and it has n't even made a dent in the capacity . This is a device that I will use for many years to come . I eventually plan to organize all my family photos on my computer , so it will be nice to have a backup plan should my computer ever go south for the winter.I highly recommend that everyone protect their treasured documents by backing them up . For a reasonable price , the Seagate Backup Plus seems to be able to handle anything I can give to it . This is something you ca n't live without .	1
I have had a lot of luck with Seagate drives and this drive is no exception . It 's fast , it 's quiet , the system has no trouble locating or accessing it , and it 's about as trouble free as anything mechanical can be expected to be . You just plug it in and it 's immediately recognized by the system and ready to go.Due to the nature of my content , I preferred not to install the automatic backup program . I have used this concept before but , since a lot of my content is temporary or in progress and will have temporary working titles , I have found it annoying in the past to have several versions of the same project backed up . The way it works is that it will initially back up the file . If you make changes to the file , those changes are incorporated . You do n't get different versions of the same file . But , if you change the title , it backs it up again under the new title since it does n't know it 's the same file . When working with large layered images or with video files , this eats up space rather quickly . If you delete a file , it does n't delete it from the backup , it stays there . ( This can be either a good thing or a bad thing , depending on the situation ) . For the backup system to work , the drive has to be on and connected to the computer all the time . But I prefer to disconnect it so that , in case of power surge ( of which we have many during summer thunderstorms ) I have an extra layer of protection in case the surge protector malfunctions.What I do is to connect the drive and manually back up what I want to keep at regular intervals . Even huge files back up pretty fast on USB 2 . Due to past experiences , I am pretty neurotic about keeping this up . If you do n't think you will be diligent in manual backups , then do use the automatic backups and , periodically , go in and delete redundant files . You really ca n't go wrong with this drive ( or Seagate drives in general for both PC and Mac ) .	1
Even someone who 's not the most technically proficient person out there will have no trouble installing this external hard drive to their Mac , which literally took me just as long to set up as it did taking it out of the box . No formatting necessary , it 's simply a case of plugging it into an available USB port ( this drive also works with USB 3.0 connections ) and an available wall outlet . There are also adaptors available to connect this via Thunderbolt/ Firewire 800 but you 'll have to purchase those separately . This aesthetically pleasing external hard drive is easy on the eyes and also comes packaged with software to backup all of your Facebook and Flickr files , which is all also a very simple affair . LED lights at the bottom tell you where your capacity levels are at but at 3TB , it 's doubtful youll be seeing it get filled up at any point in the near future , unless of course you 've got tons of files that you need to transfer into it . All in all , I came away impressed with this drive and I 'd gladly recommend it .	1
The actual external drive is great and simple to use . It comes with a usb cord and a cord to plug into a wall outlet . I was also surprised to see that it had two international adapters as well for those who travel often . Each of the cords are a good length , nothing too short but also not too long . I could place the hard drive on my desk without it getting in the way of my laptop and my paperwork . It 's a bit heavy , but its 3TB so it was expected . Has a nice smooth finish to it and looks nice . When I initially plugged it into my computer , I actually had to manually go in and start up my time machine . Last time I did this , it automatically detected the hard drive and began to back up my files . While this was no big deal , its worth noting . It took forever , almost 5 hours to back up all of my data , my last drive ( a western digital ) took about 40 minutes for the same amount . The software was an absolute bust , I still have not gotten it to work . I was able to register my device which is good but I figured I 'm not going to really be using the software at all so its not going to worry me . I 'll tackle that obstacle on a day when I feel like taking the time to troubleshoot . Until then my hard drive works just fine , and its also very quiet which is great .	1
Every year , I 'm stunned by how cheap storage is compared to the year before . Seriously , 3TB ! ? This drive is perfect for doing a weekly image backup of the 7 computers in my house.Pros : This device is out of the way in my house , but for those concerned , it has been running very quiet.Speed , at USB 3.0 , is outstanding.Like I said , SIZE ! ! 3TB ... and they even have a 4TB versionCons : The included `` Backup Plus '' software is ... well , a bit silly . I can kinda see why someone would want it , but it felt a bit gimmicky to me.Thunderbolt is prohibitively expensive . I saw I could use thunderbolt with an adapter , and thought that would make using this drive with Lightroom run amazingly . Unfortunately , this adapter is a hundred dollars . Also , the thunderbolt version of the 3TB drive is currently an additional two hundred plus ! ?	1
I originally got this for my Mac . But I have decided to give this a try on my new Samsung Series 7 Gamer Laptop and it works great . Go to Seagate , download the software ( Windows HFS driver ) & off you go . With USB 3 , FireWire and Thunderbolt connections , this works with whatever I throw at it . First differences I notice over my trusty WD 2 TB USB Drive : *FAST using USB 3*Nice physical size with rubberized texture ( 6 x 5 x 1.7 ) *Quiet enough , sort of `` odd '' sounding , unable to define what I mean by `` odd '' however : - ) *Heavy=I suspect it will survive all the ugliness of even this 2012 Presidential Election ! *Encryption=It has it but then so does my Windows 8 Pro . Still , NICE to have . *SHORT 2 foot USB Cable ? *Power Plug Adapters are INCLUDED*Not any `` real '' documentation to help PC users convert.This is a VERY nice looking , rugged appearing drive . Blazing fast IF you use the 3.0 USB . I have not had stellar results with Seagate in the reliability department but am hoping to do better with this drive . Time will tell . I will adjust this review up or down as long term use dictates . I hold high hopes for it so far . I really wish they made it easier for the casual user by including clear & comprehensive printed instructions . That aside , they counter with the addition of including all the extra power adapters so depending on you and YOUR needs , this may not be any issue at all ? I 'm sure it is far easier to search online for a way to set this up to your particular needs than it is to be in some foreign Country , not speak the language & be searching for a power adapter to avoid frying equipment : - )	1
It probably deserves 5-stars but I never will give that many for a hard drive , simply because they do crash sometimes . But this is a good drive and I trust Seagate quality . I 'm using this as my backup drive for my main HD and I have a second external that I use for my projects . It 's so quiet that I forget that it is even there sometimes .	1
I use this as a backup for my iMac and so far it works very well . Only thing that kept it from getting 5 stars is that I thought they could have done better with the look . I would have rather had the all silver look instead of the back trim . Also it would have been nice to have wireless capability .	1
I do not have this product right now - placing the order today as I have 2 Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7 '' tablets , however I have ZAGG products on ALL my other devices : Apple iPad , iPod Touch ( 2 ) , iPhone , Acer Tablet , and finally on my LG Android cell phone . ZAGG is the BEST product you can possibly have , those `` cheap '' screen protectors do nothing to keep the screen safe . Yes it is trick to put on , yes if you do n't do it right it will get messed up -- but follow the instructions and the ZAGG will install flawlessly ! I will NEVER , EVER put any other product on my devices unless they are ZAGG - they simply are the best and they work.The only reason why most people give them bad reviews is because they are not able to put the ZAGG onto their device -- as I said , I 've done it on all of mine without any issues . The first device I installed it on ( full body protection ) was my iPad ( 1st generation ) . The protectors are still on there 2+ years later and not a scratch on the screen and it 's easy to clean , so much so that I usually use a damp sponge to clean the screen without worrying that water will damage it .	1
I have hade it for 1 year and my screen is still intact this is the best one I have ever used	1
I did my research and picked this one . It works very well , sounds great . Its pretty cool that you can listen to internet audio or just use your iPhone 's airplay functionality . I did a test and was able to start Airplay streaming from my iPhone WITHOUT turning on my TV . It is very convenient and keeps the music playing in extreme laziness I need some music now emergencies . Zone 2 functions have not yet been tested.I noticed two updates since i have bought it , which means that Denon is supporting this product . The updates were mostly to support network streaming.What is really cool is to listen to stereo music in 5.1 Cinema mode . It is a trippy experience and very fun.ALSO IF you buy this , I highly recommend Batpigworlds Denon to English guide for all sorts of setup tips for example what to do with all of the knobs on a powered subwoofer since the denon manual does n't specify . Batpig also explains how to maximize the benifit of the Audessy calibration routine.Disclaimer : I am an AAPL investor so my glowing review of Apple 's airplay should be taken with a grain of salt .	1
Yet a bit expensive for the features you are missing . I could notice an improvement in sound over the receiver I replaced but lost a couple features I frequently used .	1
Works immediately . Small and portable with no extra wires . Hooked up to non hdmi projector at school immediately . Still need to figure out something for the sound but definitely makes older technology work with new technology .	1
The Apple TV is an amazing device , but only has 1 output : HDMI . This adapter allows me to output via VGA , which permits me to connect the Apple TV to projectors .	1
Update 2-Sep-13 : Put on CM 10.2.2 ( Android 4.2.2 ) last week . I 've got to say , it 's nice . Fonts are small , though one could choose dpi if they had visual issues ( google this ) . Netflix works , and the UI is really quite nice - pretty much no need for Button Savior , battery life is same as CM7 . In general I like it better than CM7 . My major hardware dislikes are headphone jack requires a little wiggling sometimes , no BT , no GPS . Seems to charge fine with a normal cable.At this point I lean toward Samsung tablets - I like the IR and the microSD slot.===========================Update Jul 2012 : I 've installed Cyanogen 7 , which works with button savior . I had trouble installing from .zip booting into recovery but was able to install without a hitch using a bootable microSD card . Fonts are sometimes a bit big , as is line spacing , but in general , CM7 frees you of the B & N ; walled-ness , even as somewhat mitigated below . Netflix does n't work , and Google Chrome wo n't run on Android 2.3 . Headphone jack a bit intermittent - need to wiggle wire sometimes.===========================Original review , Dec. 2011.===========================First I give a summary , followed by the details if U are interested . I hope people will read reviews here , as , if you say much at all on B & N ; 's site , they do n't post your review and do n't allow you to modify it so that U can post it ! : A Nook Tablet could be quite good if you only want to : - Read ebooks purchased from B & N ; - Browse the web on a tablet- Play a small selection of games , having to pay 3-4X normal Android/Apple pricesGet something else or modify it if U want to : - Buy a full selection of games/apps- Pay the same price for a game as U would on an iPhone/iPad , Android Phone buying from either the Android Marketplace or Amazon App Store.- Play music where U can sort by artist , album , genre , etc.- Play mpeg videos- Watch YouTubeIf U are willing to do a bit of work , you can do all this by modifying the device . I used it rooted with the modifications described below for 11 months , before installing Cyanogen 7.2 on it . This is a huge improvement over rooted with the below modifications - it 's essentially a normal 7 '' Android tablet now.The Details : ============My daughter got a Nook Tablet for Christmas 2011 . She 'd been saving for an iPad ( ~ $ 500 ) but at the rate she was saving , we took pity after a year and a half.While she does read ( and so do us parents ) , she also wanted to use it as a music player , and a movie watching device while away from wireless in the car , on a plane , etc , and she wanted to play some games.I did my reading and we seriously considered an iPad for the family with each of our 2 kids putting in $ 150 or so.I read about the Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet - the Fire only had 8GB of onboard storage at the time , and no micro SD slot . A deal-breaker . This was pre Samsung GalaxyTab , Nexus , etc . Since the Nook Tablet has 16GB and a micro SD slot , we went to a store to take a look . Sales guy was good , and the device hardware shows well . Once we got it home and were doing more reading about setup , we found the first of our issues : Issue # 1 : Onboard Memory========================Of the 16GB of storage , you can only place your own items in 1GB . The rest is for B & N-purchased ; content . 1GB is not enough for a music collection , or any significant amount of video . A 32GB Class 4 micro-SD card was also in her stocking , having read about this ahead of time.Once she unwrapped it and we set it up ( easy enough ) , annoyance # 2 showed itself : Issue # 2 : App prices and quantity=================================2 Examples : Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja.- BN Market : $ 2.99 , $ 3.95.- Amazon 's Android Market : $ 0.99 ( ad-free ) , with free ad-supported versions available- Android Market , $ 0.99 for either , plus free , ad-supported versions available.- Apple App Store , $ 0.99 and $ 0.99 , plus free , ad-supported versions available.YouTube : free/pre-installed on all Android/Apple phones/tablets I know of , not available on the Nook Tablet , not in the Nook store.I did n't buy either game , but instead looked back to some of my pre-Christmas reading - U can load Amazon 's Appstore without rooting the device , esp . if it 's running v1.4.0 of the software . I got that working and bought $ 0.99 ad-free Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds . While I was at it , I side-loaded a few other apps by e-mailing them to myself and web-browsing to get them , and got usb drivers working on an XP laptop so I could sideload via adb over usb.I was n't home for Christmas , but I did have my work laptop which has music on it . I copied some over and began to use the music player ... .Issue # 3 : Built-in Music Player Limitations===========================================The built-in music player in Android is decent - has been since Android 1.5 - the first version I used . U can , generally , sort by artist , album , etc , and the UI has dark backgrounds rather than white . The Nook built-in music player does n't allow sort . For this , I did n't want to buy a music player , so I went ahead and rooted the device and installed Honeycomb 's ( Android 3.0 's ) music player , which is free . Also put the standard Android YouTube app on since I could now access the Android Market . The problem was n't quite solved , because changes to the SD card ( adding files ) were n't recognized . I tried Winamp , Songbird and Android 4.0 's music player when ICS came out . They had the same issue . TTPod does work - you can manually refresh at any time . I now run Cyanogen , whose music player ( modified stock android to add gesture support ) works just fine . They were aware of tablets when they wrote it.This is ironic - B & N ; had to do actual work to make it much worse than using the normal android version , plus they had nice opportunities to improve on the experience of a phone due to the large screen - Cyanogen 7 Android supports gestures for music - do an arrow to the left like `` & lt ; '' , say , and it 'll go back a track . This would be great while driving . ( Note that U can unroot by putting a copy of 1.4.0 on an SD card which , though I 'm not sure , would probably allow you to return the device if U needed to ) .Issue # 4 : Built-in Video Player Limitations===========================================I 'd also brought on my work laptop half a dozen videos I nabbed from our TiVos from which I stripped the commercials , saving them as mpg videos . These would n't play with the built-in player.I solved this with MX Player , free version , which plays them fine . U can do this only if U 've installed Amazon 's App Store or rooted and can access the Android Market . People out there are selling PC software to convert videos to a format Nook Tablet can use . No need - just get another video player . MX Player Tip : brightness control is an up/down swipe on the left hand side of the screen , volume on the right.Issue # 5 : UI Inflexibility==========================U ca n't add shortcuts to the desktop , and ca n't do much with the sliding apple-style bar either . For this , I installed App Manager ( tough to find a .apk to sideload using adb , so I needed rooting and then got it from Android Market ) . This is a fantastic app and I do n't use my GoLauncher screen much any more.Also , there 's one physical button . Standard android buttons such as menu ( right-click ) and back are n't always around in the UI , and holding home does n't bring up a list of open applications as it does in carrier or stock android . They should have put those standard 2 buttons on the device . Update after a month rooted : use Button Savior , which gives soft buttons with a flyout . Once in a while , you have to use NT Hidden Settings to check USB Debugging unless you use Cyanogen . Update post Cyanogen : CM7 can have soft buttons ( back , menu , home , etc ) displayed all the time , if desired , and has Button Savior installed as well.Issue # 6 : Can only charge with their charger/cable==================================================Nothing more to say . BlackBerries and Android phones in the house all can charge in the car or at all the computers by just connecting a cable . It charge very slowly , even if it does n't tell you it is , when connected to a PC because or other charger . With some irony , B & N ; has had to mail me both a charger and a cable this year due to breakage . If they could charge with any micro-USB cable , they would n't have to . Update post-Cyanogen : With Cyanogen , it charges with any micro-USB cable , though slowly unless it 's the actual Nook stuff - there must be something in hardware.Issue # 7 : OTA update breaks all the niceness I 've achieved==========================================================An OTA update , v1.4.1 , will break the ability to mail yourself .apks to be used to enable non-BN apps to install and to enable debugging . I imagine U could have done these steps while on 1.4.0 and gotten sideloading via PC/adb to work , but U ca n't disable OTA updates . U can if you root , though , so I did , then used SQLite to modify a setting to only update when done manually . It 'll never auto-update . Update post-Cyanogen : irrelevant now.Goodness # 1 : Hardware is pretty sweet=====================================Snappy , installs apps fine , opens them quickly , videos are fairly smooth , scrolling is pretty good ( but not as nice as Apple 's ) .Screen is great from angles , clear and bright.It 's lightweight and can be held easily in one hand.Speaker is pretty loud - louder than any of our phones except maybe BlackBerry.Goodness # 2 : the Reading Aspect===============================The reading end of the device is well-implemented , though I give Amazon 's original Kindle and all subsequent ones and advantage - an order of a book on an original kindle appeared on the device in less time than it took me to back out of the purchase UI . Doing so from the web is also very fast . A web order using a computer of a B & N ; sample appeared about an hour later , but quite snappily when done from the device.Goodness # 3 : Books with Videos/Sound====================================Yes , these are available on Kindle Fire and iPads . I know . I do like the talking kid 's books ( reminds me of a LeapFrog Tag pen , but without the ability to touch words and hear them ) , and the free cookbook sample had a video of making a chocolate sauce . This is good for cooking ! U can see what each stage is supposed to look like.Goodness # 4 : Good if U Root it , for $ 250========================================When rooted , it 's a nice tablet + it has the B & N ; connection , and it cost $ 250 . It is n't an iPad ( no cameras or BT ) , and it 's half the price . Update Nov 2012 : There are now a multitude of 7 '' tablets ( ASUS , Samsung , Google ) which get my recommendation .	-1
The price of this tablet I do love.Thats about it.First of all the design of the the tablet feels very cheap.Almost the whole shell of the nook is plastic.Since also the home nook button neing plastic sometimes it gets stuck and makes it hard to push.The format of the homepage I do not like.If you want new wallpaper you have to download a picture file file onto your nook same with music and video.You do get the apps hulu netflix and pandora but thats very limited.Whats also very limited is the app store.What a joke.The apps are all very boring and overpriced.The book are usually never free.The only Up to this tablet it you can watch flash video which is basically the only upside to this piece of junk.Either save up your money for an ipad or or kindle fire.I will be returing my nook ! ! ! !	-1
Beware . I bought this used and the person or company I bought it from did n't have the common sense to de-register it from the previous owner . That should be done before you sell it . No excuse .	-1
in my honest opinion nook is unfinished product.none of my technical books in pdf format i was able to read due to pdf reader rendering formulas all over the screen with middle-size font.i am able to see formulas in small font but then the rest of text is unreadable.formula rendering in medium font is a mess however text is readable . i would have expected developer of the device spent more time on fine-tuning the text rendering on ebook reader .	-1
I got this for my wife as a Christmas present because we have a bunch of books in ePub format . I put them on a microSD card , went through the arduous setup procedure and now it will not open any of my books . I have , over 6 hours invested today trying to get support help . Phone goes to some third world place and I can not understand the people . Chat ( 4 times ) is better but they finally concluded it wad my credit cards fault ! ! Basically , useless support.Returning it tomorrow ...	-1
I think that all international customers should be forewarned that Barnes and Noble prevents you from being able to purchase any books online from their bookstore , you will be sent emails stating that books can only be sold to customers `` physically '' residing in the United States . This is all despite having an international credit card accepted all over the United States ( even by Barnes & Noble themselves as this is the same card that I used to pay for my B & N ; membership ) and despite even giving them my US postal and physical address where all of my packages would be signed for by a real person.The thing that angers me the most is that I explained to Barnes & Noble ( via phone ) that I live in Trinidad and they said that it would not be a problem for me to purchase books , but after purchasing a Nook color plus additional items such as screen protectors , a leather case and a 32 gig Sandisk memory card ( all bought on Amazon ) , I have not been able to purchase a single book.If International Customers are not welcome , there should at least be some type of warning on their website . I feel like I was ripped-off by Barnes & Noble , and the sad thing about it is that I bought it all as a birthday gift for my wife . Shame on Barnes & Noble , that sales rep lied to me just to make a sale , my money was good enough for them but I am not good enough for their product . Now I have this New Nook color with all of these extras just gathering dust.It is sad to see just how low some companies will stoop to make a dollar.The real slap in the face is that after registering the nook on the Barnes & Noble website for the purpose of purchasing books , they have no problem sending me offers week after week to purchase even more of their products but as far as I am concerned , they have lost this customer permanently.P.S . This review has nothing whatsoever to do with Amazon.com , my gripe is with Barnes & Noble for giving false information to secure a sale and caring nothing about International Customers . ( UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE ) In the interest of fairness to Barnes & Noble and giving you Amazon.com community 100 % reliable information I decided to open an account with a bank that 's based in the USA to see if B & N ; would be able to access the funds from that account , I 'm trying to find out whether it 's a location issue or just a payment issue so we can all know for sure.I decided to try this little experiment because I just ca n't understand how I can gain access to sample books from B & N ; but every time I try to purchase one there seems to be a problem , what makes this whole thing even more confusing is the e-mail that was sent by B & N ; after I tried to purchase a Book via my Scotia Master Card ( books can only be sold to customers `` physically '' residing in the United States ) .I now have a Bank Of America Visa Debit Card which I have not tried as yet , it is possible that the issue with Barnes & Noble is that they can not access funds from my Scotia Master Card which is based in Trinidad so I will give the Bank Of America card a try seeing that it 's based in the USA and if that does not work then the last resort will be to try using my Pay Pal account . I 'll post an update as to whether it worked or not . ( UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE ) I 'm sorry for taking so long but anyway , let us get on with it . As I said before , every time I tried to purchase a book there seems to be a problem , what makes this whole thing even more confusing is the e-mail that was sent by B & N ; after I tried to purchase a Book via my Scotia Master Card ( books can only be sold to customers `` physically '' residing in the United States ) .Well I found out that IT IS POSSIBLE to purchase books on the Nook once you are using a US based card . I was not able to purchase books using my Scotia Master Card but I had no problem whatsoever when using my Bank of America Visa Card , so it definitely has nothing to do with our geographical location , or IP address . The only issue that I see here is the fact that not everyone has access to a US Bank Card but you may still have a chance with making purchases via PayPal.I have noticed that there are some US based sellers that have problems accessing funds from Trinidad based Credit Cards , some even have problems accessing funds from US based Cards although they are also in the US themselves , in cases like this I 've found that the best payment method to avoid any headaches is via PayPal . I 've never had any issue when paying via PayPal , even when other forms of payment could not work.I hope that this helps a little .	-1
Received this as a gift last Christmas ( 11 months ago ) . Manual claims that at a typical rate of reading , one should be able to use it for a month on one charge . My battery already lasts only 2 - 2 1/2 hrs on one charge before the unit wo n't start due to a low battery level , requiring recharging . This is either a false claim on the part of B & N or else the batteries they use are of exceedingly poor quality . I 've used hundreds of rechargeable batteries of various brands and technologies over the years ; if this thing suffers from a battery problem , then the batteries in these devices are on par with the cheapest quality / lemon nicad rechargeables I use to encounter 25 years ago . Keep away .	-1
I had to put generic Android on it because Barnes and Noble had it so hamstrung . Should have gone with the new 7 & # 34 ; Nexus . No built in GPS turned out to be a major lack .	-1
I am already a kindle owner and I love my kindle . The kindle does have some limitations , most especially in the handling of pdfs . The kindle does not annotate and curate highlighted text of pdf 's you upload . This is where I found the Nook HD more useful , apart from the fact that it gives you full access to the Play Store . In handling big pdf 's , the Nook HD is slow and the highlighting of scanned pdf 's is not very smooth . I really tried to love the Nook but did not and so I did not use it beyond the first month . I will not recommend the Nook . If your goal is the android store , just get a nexus tablet and download B & N app . It is cheap and works much better than the Nook .	-1
Bought this to replace the broken micro usb cable on my old charger for my Nook Tablet . Wished I could just get the cable as the AC plug works fine . After 2 weeks the micro usb end of the cable broke again . This is the 3rd Barnes and Noble cable I have gone through and will not be purchasing another from them again . Any plain micro usb cable will charge the Nook Tablet , so save some money and get a cheaper unbranded cable instead .	-1
Drive simply will not mount . I imagine this must be fine for the person it works for but I 'm returning mine as non-functioning .	-1
After just two cycles of the batteries , they stopped working in my tactical flashlight . I measured the voltage and found them to be almost 4.2 volts fully charged ( when it is supposed to be 3.0 ! ! ! ) . I do n't know if this can damage a voltage regulated light , but I 'm not willing to take the chance ( they do n't work in two separate types of flashlights I have anyway because they immediately shut off when turned on with these batteries now ) . I 'm returning these and buying some surefire non-rechargeable batteries . What good is a tactical flashlight if at the exact moment you need it to work , the batteries fail ? And if you are n't using it for tactical purposes , then why get a light with CR123A batteries in the first place ? Even when this charger WAS working ( only on the first cycle ) , it got way too hot for comfort while charging and took way longer than it says . Also , the light turns halfway to green but stays halfway red , and does n't charge both batteries evenly .	-1
Would n't buy this again . I never really used the product because it didnt fit the phone that well with the phone case on .	-1
Well it seemed to be working fine for about six hours , then it began discharging my GPS completely . Had to charge it several hours in car to get it working again .	-1
THIS PRODUCT IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE AT J AND R. YOU ENTER YOUR INFORMATION AND THEN GET TO THE PLACE WHERE IT SAYS : `` PLACE YOUR ORDER '' AND THE CART GOES TO `` 0 '' . REAL DRAG . i CALLED JANDR TWICE ABOUT REMOVING THIS PAGE FROM AMAZON BUT THEY SAID IT TAKES TIME .	-1
I used this product on a Philips DVD Recorder . Horrible Mistake ! ! ! It must have screwed up the lens alignment because all discs that are now inserted into the drive come back with the message `` NO DISC '' and no playing or recording can be done . It ruined my machine !	-1
Trust me it does not work . I have tried it on all rooms , anddoes not transmit . Waste of money . If you want an item that does work I have found the SBC wireless to be the best and you can buy it at amazon or walmart .	-1
This product does not have caller ID and makes a hissing sound that is irritating . I bought it from BuyAccessories , who weregreat with customer service and refunded my purchase . I will buy from them again . It 's not their fault the product is mediocre .	-1
I thought I ordered both receiver and transmitter , had to re-order by phone . They told me they would send me a R.A. by email and I never got it now I 'm stuck with two orders .	-1
This device did not work for me . They use the electrical wiring in your home to send and receive the sound signal . That electrical wiring can also carry a lot of noise from electrical appliances and even from light dimmers . In an apartment the noise is increased by all the electrical devices used by the neighbours , so in my case it was very noisy making the RCA adapters a total waist of money . I found a similar device that uses 2.4GHz and it works great for me . But the device called DualJack could potentially interfere with other 2.4GHz signals like a computer wireless land or even wireless phones , so far I have not had any interference . You have to try them and see what works for you .	-1
This extension requires one of the following Wireless Phone Jack Systems : RCA RC 926 , GE GE926 or D916 . ( per packaging ) . It does NOT work with the RCA RC 930 , which Amazon is bundling with it . Do n't buy it with the RC 930 !	-1
I used it once and my sister long distance could n't even tell . I have used Plantronics plastic tube-type microphones at work and the sound quality was better the sister said.It was weird to have a very lightweight headset on my head -- instead of a phone clenched between my head and shoulder . But ! I knew it was something I could learn to love quickly.The mike was not quite long enough however ... call me a big mouth ! It did n't reach around in front of my face . It was very much to the side . Just in the peripheral vision ... again something I was sure I could get accustomed to.But . The next time I plugged it in , if I touched the cord or the phone or moved there was massive crackling . I gave up after a few more tries . I should of sent it back ( Amazon is SUPER about replacing items ) but did n't really think about it until the warranty had expired.I am ready to try again . But this time will read all the reviews before purchasing .	-1
I 'm not brutal with equipment , but in a few short weeks , the flimsy plastic part that holds the ear pieces to the headset broke on one side . Within a month or two the other side went as well forcing me to use office paper clamps to hold the whole thing together.I use them in bed late at night when the household is asleep . A second convenient bedside charger would be nice . I tend to put them down on the bedside table before I doze off rather than get up and walk across the room hook it up for recharge . If you 're a late night TV watcher , you too might call this justifiable laziness . Too many times I put them on the next night and find the battery 's down.I honestly think that before I replace them with another wireless , I 'd find a way to sneak an extension wire across the room through attic or basement space and go with a standard wired headphone .	-1
I 'll never understand why re-useable cable ties are so expensive , or so unavailable . These Belkins are really for permanent stereo or computer installation . And even for that purpose , I do n't care for their design.If you are a musician looking to tie up microphone , speaker or instrument cables , these are not suitable .	-1
the whole tie Velcro to it self only at the end of it is there the opposite type of Velcro .	-1
Instead of the pictured Belkin cable , I got a flimsy generic cable . Total and complete rip off .	-1
I bought this bag for a 15.4 '' laptop mbp , an extra battery , a spare HD , and some papers . Not very much stuff . So I was extremely disappointed that a $ 90 leather bag that supposedly was of good quality had one of the straps completely rip off the body of the bag , where the strap was stitched in the side.This bag was used for 7 months before the strap ripped under normal , daily usage . There was nothing done to shorten the life of a bag such as this one .	-1
I was going to buy one of these cases for my new Palm Vx . It looked great and I figured if it was made by Palm that it would be a good buy to keep my new toy ... I mean tool ... safe . Fortunately , I saw one in a store before I ordered one . As some of the other reviews have said , it 's made out of cheap plastic with a thin sheet of metal on the front for decoration . The hingers are fragile and the spring-loading is weak . I do n't think it 's worth the cost and I 've seen them as low as $ 25.If you 're buying a hardcase , I 'm assuming you want some protection for your Palm . This wo n't give it to you . If you just want something that looks good to cover-up , there are lots of nice leather ones out there.As for me , I decided to spend the extra money on a Rhinoskin molded aluminum case . I 'll let you know how that goes . So far , so good ... check them out .	-1
I have owned five of these UPS units over the past four years . I purchased three for my Mac and PC at home . Then I had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit . Currently only ONE still works ! I have very infrequent power outages , perhaps three in the past four years . These units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down . My G5 mac was so power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch LCD . I ca n't comment on other UPS brands such as Belkin , but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores . There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this may be a reflection of APC 's popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand . My experience over the past four years has been mixed . These are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes . If you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear . I chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms . Many users do not have that flexibility so a UPS is essential insurance . The units I puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years . I can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years ; three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until I bought new batteries . Prices vary from $ 15 to $ 50 depending on the vendor . Battery life depends on many factors so I do n't begrudge APC for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable . I bought APC branded batteries and ca n't explain why the recurrent failures . I 'm frustated with my APC products but it may be a problem with this model . Just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an UPS !	-1
Unlike many of the other Minidisc owners on here , I happen to like MP3 . The minidisks are great ... .but for something small and light to tuck in my pocket , nothing beats the Rio ! It 's at least half the size and a third the weight of my minidisk player . And yes , the size DOES make a difference to many people.I love getting free MP3 's off the web , and while I *could* put them on minidisks , I like being able to every day or so put a completely different assortment of songs on the Rio to listen to . It 's certainly not much harder than recording a disk and I 'm one of those people that can listen to favorite songs over and over so a little repetition does n't bother ME any.Unfortunately , the Rio is not without faults . In fact , I have a hard time recommending it . 32 meg is definitely NOT enough . I got a Flash card , and have started having varying problems , first with my memory being unusable , and then having small chunks become corrupted . Am now having problems with the player intermittently stopping on its own and freezing up so I have to remove the battery . Oh , should mention that the first Rio I got had a broken battery compartment and was returned . Am still waiting on my rebates . HATE not being able to use it on Windows NT , and not having USB . And the headsets that come with it are worthless for many people . Personally , I 'm not sure I even want to try the later Rio models , as I 've had so much trouble with this one in only a few months of owning it .	-1
. STOP ! ! ! . 1/ This camera is NOT 640x480 , is a fixed 320x240 . CCD is not even 1/3 megapixel , is 1/10 I think . Images are bad ( like enlarging a thumbnail ? ) Print them in an 1x1 inch rectangle and they 'll be somehow fine , anything bigger is like old CGA ... awful . When you take shots they look very bad , whatever you do to edit ( software ) and fix them . I have another ( true ) 640x480 camera and pictures are excelent , but these ... 2/ It does n't include an AC adapter , so be prepared to buy LOTS of AA batteries or spend another 50 bucks.3/ Fine as a serial videoconference camera ( 30 fps ) , but watch for the batteries.4/ Take your first picture , and begin to wonder if it 's ok . The lack of an LCD screen begins to bother you when you find out you ca n't review your shots . Think about it : you wont review your pictures untill you get to the PC.Sorry I am very disappointed .	-1
I got this from a yard sale . The cords are unwieldy . The bass is too strong and is not adjustable . Stay away from systems that do not have adjustable subwoofers .	-1
I was very disappointed with this product.As one other reviewer said the stem is too short . So others can hardly hear me . Obviously , if they can hardly hear me then what good is the product ? For instance , ever try getting a flight itinerary straight when the other person can hardly hear you ? ( And I 'm short myself , so it 's definitely not a matter of my having oversized head/mouth dimensions . ) But , even when I took off the headset and held the mike right near my mouth and at other positions the sound was described as muffled and somewhat low , though without background noise.I also found the headset somewhat uncomfortable and difficult to put on at the moment . I do n't have a need to wear one all the time , but just for certain calls . I often found myself fumbling to get it on . I think I 'll try an over-the-head model next .	-1
I bought a new pair of Motorola Talkabout FV300 radios and it simply does not work with them . When I plug it in , turn it on and press the PTT button , the radio starts transmitting and does n't stop until I shut the radio off . I knew the VOX feature would n't work , but it was my understanding that it was supposed to still work with manual operation of the PTT button . It does not . However , it does work with my older Talkabout which is a T5000 , but not with VOX . I 'm giving it two stars because they should have been more clear as to which radios work and which do n't .	-1
JR Music and Amazon must be KIDDING to think that they do not need to have a policy to make it obvious that this is a USED product . To bury the fact that this item is `` reconditioned '' at the very BOTTOM of a multi-page description instead of in the TITLE or first line is deceitful ! They are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice it .	-1
'Snagless ' ..I thought is was a flat wound cable or something , but it 's just a regular cable and overpriced at that .	-1
I ordered both the Belkin 25 ft CAT 5e and the Belkin 50 ft. CAT 5e cables since I was not sure if the 25 ft cable would be long enough -- - as it turned out the 25 ft cable was just what I needed so I did not use the 50 ft. cable . The 25 ft cable comes in Belkin packaging and markings but ( like other reviewers stated ) the 50 ft. cable comes in a plastic bag that says made in China and there is no indication that the cable is a Belkin.I gave this 2 stars because it does not appear to be a Belkin product -- - I would give the 25 ft. cable 5 stars .	-1
The only positive thing I can say about this tripod is that it is very light and very cheap . I tried to use it several times - does it 's job only if the camera is positioned right on top ( 90 degrees ) . If you move the camera and change the angle the top stand twists and fall back under the camera weight . I was using canon powershot S3 IS , which is really light . I ca n't imagine if you use it with a dslr camera . My final conclusion - It is good if you do n't need to change the vertical position of the camera .	-1
Does Not Work for 720k formatting . If you need to be able to format to 720k , this will not work . Otherwise it works fine , but I gave it 2 stars because I am unable to use it and I hope others can be saved the trouble .	-1
Well , I had read all the reviews of this model on Amazon and based my purchasing decision partly on this information . I expected picture quality from the 310 to be at least as good as my old PAL Sony 8mm . However , after 2 weeks of using the 310 we had to conclude that it simply provides inferior picture quality in most lighting situations . Inferior in both colour reproduction and in clarity , whatever the technical specs . say . For example , I have a coat with a maroon sleeve but this appeared bright red whatever exposure or program setting I used ; same with the shop model we checked with when returning the purchased unit to the store - it did n't appear to be just a snafu with the particular unit we had purchased . We also compared the 310 picture with the supposedly inferior Panasonic 910 and both colour and clarity were actually better on the latter . Why ? What is Sony playing at ? We were expecting twice the clarity ( & quot ; resolution & quot ; ) and 3 times the colour depth from this Digital 8 camera , as widely advertised . What are they talking about ? When it comes down to it , its about picture quality , no matter what bells and whistles the machine has.Boy , was I glad to get my money back !	-1
Bought this to use for labeling binders and to label how much money remains on gift cards.The ribbon that prints seems to have been sitting on the warehouse shelf for too long . It partially prints each letter/number like some of the ribbon has gotten old and wo n't stick to the label . I would not recommend this product .	-1
Used it for a couple of months and decided to switch to a VHF radio . Reach is minimal , even two cars driving next to each other does n't allow for good communication . Go for a talkabout if you look for something simple or a VHF if you want long distance good quality communication .	-1
As hanheld the range is very poor . Forget about using it inside a car , it will not pick anything , not even the weather channels . Running on batteries as a handheld picks up car engine noise from even 3 feet away . Paired with Midland 18-2442 Mobile CB Antenna for use in the car and while the range has greatly improved , there is a lot of noise , making it hard to understand any conversations . The antenna was tunned with a SWR meter to about 2:1 , which is great , but noise still present . NOAA channels were clear the first two days but now barely work . Also picks engine noise . Tried using chokes on DC powerline and also on RF but no luck , engine noise still present.I got this to use on my car as I spend quite sometime on the road but for now I 'm quite disappointed after a week of usage and tweaking . It should work right out of the box ! Going on a trip to Canada this week so I 'll be testing it further ( 1200mile trip ) then i 'll decide if to exchange it or just get a refund and look for some other solution.The idea is great . Love it.The implementation sucks . : (	-1
This through the glass unit performed well enough for my needs as I am only looking for local traffic tie-up information of close-by autos ... .the problem is that it will not stay on the windshield ... .I am on my third unit in an attempt to get it to stay on permanently instead of a few weeks ... .the first one was put on by professional installers of all my 3rd party electronics ... have dealt with them for years as they do excellent work ... it fell off and was lost after about 10 days ... .the second one I put on myself ... and followed the directions to an exact degree ... .including the heating of the glue with a hair dryer for 4 minutes ... .cleaning the windshield as directed etc etc ... .using silicon to seal the unit further ... this one stayed on for more than a month and then fell off and was lost ... .the third one was supplied to me directly by Midland at no charge , much to their credit ... .I havent tried putting on the third one yet because of the weather ... I have my fingers crossed ... .would I buy this again ... .definitely not ... ..probably no through the glass units from anyone else either ... ... ... ... ...	-1
This thing does not work.If you buy it you will throw it away , swr 's are always high , and can not be set , it may look cool but that is all it has going fo it .	-1
I did my homework , and though I knew this trackball was mechanical and rather an old model , I still thought that overall many people had been happy with it . I have used trackballs before to a limited extent , and my husband has the Kensington Optical Trackball with the cool red glow , but I wanted something that would better match my Mac . Well , forget about that . The Orbit got very difficult to manipulate very soon after use ... I had cleaned it several times in the first week , and I am a clean freak where the area around my Mac is concerned . I found that the tiny springs inside were very fragile and one was not really in the right place . After two weeks I sent this back to AMAZON . It is pretty , it SHOULD work better , but after thinking it over I ditched `` matching '' , went out to Staples and tried the Logitech Marble Mouse . It is a great fit for my hand , and now resides on my desk . The marble mouse is cheaper too , which is odd . If I had n't wanted a trackball right away I would have bought it at AMAZON . Your options are n't that great pricewise as far as trackballs go , which makes the Marble Mouse a really good deal , unless you are a power user of photo manipulation software or other specific apps which need many buttons programmed .	-1
Bleck , bleck , bleck ! Do n't let this trackball sour you from the concept . Trackballs themselves are MUCH better and MUCH easier on your hands , wrists , and arms then regular mice , but this one is a real stinker.First off , it 's FAR too heavy . The ball is mechanical , NOT optical , so it makes for slow , plodding , difficult motions . It 's a chore to push your cursor across the screen and it really causes a lot of fatigue in your hands and fingers.Secondly , it 's just not as comfortable as other , similar designed trackballs like the MUCH easier and OPTICAL Marble Mouse by Logitech . This one is just too wide in the base for me and the buttons were too far stretched apart . There was n't any natural & quot ; drapping & quot ; of the hand on this design.Thirdly , it 's WAY overpriced . For ten dollars less you can get an optical trackball which will give you a lot more percision with a lot less effort.For those who like this style , I highly recommend you opt for the Logitech Marble Mouse . At about $ 20 , it 's a much better value . I used one for about five years and noticed a GREAT reduction in wrist pain.For those wanting more options ( such as scroll wheels and such ) , I would suggest the very well designed Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman . It 's what I upgraded to after using the Marble Mouse for so many years . It does require a slight change in position of hand , but it stays away from those horridly uncomfortable thumb-wheel designs you see ; you still use your fingers to roll the main ball around.Do yourself a favor and get a trackball . Just make sure it 's an optical one instead of a mechanical one . You 'll really be thankful you did and you 'll notice improvement and relief from wrist/hand/arm pain .	-1
This was a good starter card for watching television through my computer . It worked well with Windows 98 , but if you were thinking of using it with any operating system released this century , you 'd find yourself out of luck . Initially , with 98 , I thought very highly of the TV Wonder . However , upon upgrading to Windows 2000 , I had to download extra drivers from ATI which ended up locking up the computer after watching TV for more than a few minutes . After that , I thought XP would handle it a little better . Unfortunately , it was worse . I could n't find any software support from ATI that would co-exist with Windows XP , and have yet to.In retrospect , I probably should have gone with the TV Wonder VE which is compatible with Windows XP after downloading an updated driver from ATI 's site .	-1
I have had this changer for approximately 5 weeks , past the Amazon 30 day return policy , unless stocking charges and shipping costs are paid by me . JVC will not exchange the unit but will repair it at their local authorized dealer.At first , there were seldom , random skips , garbles , and lyric repeats . These have become more frequent and annoying . Pristine discs made no difference and changing the optical cable did not help . My ten year old Yamaha changer , it has drawer problems , plays my discs flawlessly.So far , this is the only problem but a major one that is getting worse . Everything else is working and I do like the unit . The sound quality is superior to my old Yamaha and the remote is better.I do not know if this unit can be fixed or , like with cars , the repair people can not duplicate the problem.I am not going to put a lot of time , energy , or gas into getting this changer repaired beyond my first attempt . Maybe DVD changers are made better and I can use one as a CD player ? I am disappointed , to say the least , and from my experience , I know purchasing electronic components can be a gamble . I hope your purchase goes better.Update : 1/21/09I took the unit in for warranty repair . They replaced the laser and on the technician 's equipment , both analog and optical cable connections were tested , the unit played flawlessly . On my home system with a new optical cable , I again had the original problems . I gave the unit to a friend and it works perfectly on his sytem using the analog connection . It must be a hand shake issue with my equipment so I no longer believe it is the unit itself . I have read that some electronic equipment combinations do not always work well together . I conclude that was my situation .	-1
This product is made in China and runs for ten seconds one cycle at a time with automatic rewind and no sound or video accompanying . This product is not like the previous head cleaner which had four cycles of aproximately two minutes each with a sound and video format . I liked the original product much , much better - not happy . Try to find Maxell SKU : 290058 , UPC : 025215290053 , to see if it does the job .	-1
I put the tape in and it immediately turned off my vcr and ejected the tape . I tried again and the same thing happened . I tried it in another vcr and the same thing happened . Amazon gave me a full refund .	-1
Warranted for lifetime but 9 dollars return EACH ( even if shipped multiples ) for shipping plus whatever you pay to ship to them to repair facility . They can be shipped for 3 dollars or less ( no matter how many ) very easily so Koss is definitely cheating us here . Used to be 6 dollars and even then they charged individually for these tiny items but you could gain a little over this 12 dollar for new price.Ear buds themselves are fairly good ( usually last me about 2 months ) when compared to how long most others last at this price and sound is also pretty good . They fit well and stay in good too .	-1
I wanted to try these because I use my mp3 player in noisy environments , and they were supposed to be able to fit tightly into your ears and block the outside noise . Well , I never was able to use them and finaly gave up on themn . I tried many times to squeeze the foam and hoped that they would mold to the shape of my ears , but it was never satisfactory . I found them very uncomfortable .	-1
Good sound isolation , too much bass for realistic sound , might be ok if you only listen to disco ... very uncomfortable after about 30 minutes .	-1
I 've tried out a number of noise-cancelling and isolating headphones with an iPod . Here are my impressions : Shure E4c ( isolating ) : the most accurate and open I know of . With high-quality source electtronics and material , these ( or the E5c 's ) would be the pick of the lot . Unfortunately , they 're too revealing for listening to compressed source material through the mediocre electronics of an iPod and very quickly become very fatiguing in that context . Their other disadvantage is obvious : they 're quite expensive.Sennheiser PXC 300 ( noise-cancelling ) : these are my favorites . Very accurate without being too unforgiving for an iPod . Their disadvantages : comparatively bulky & wo n't play as loudly as any of the others mentioned here.Sennheiser CX300-B ( isolating ) : considerably more compact and somewhat less expensive than the PXC 300 , these are also quite good . Bass can be very tubby ( that might be improved by stiffer custom inserts , but that would more than double the price ) Koss `` The Plug '' ( isolating ) : laughably innacurate . Buy these only if you have tin ears and a habit of losing small things on airplanes . Otherwise do yourself a favor and invest a bit more in one of the alternatives .	-1
Does n't have much range . This definitely decreased the volume in my headphones . It works as a volume control but it should n't decrease the volume to do so .	-1
Seriously , are these airplane headphones ? That 's how poor I found the sound quality in these . I was shocked after seeing all the great reviews for these and then after finally checking them out for myself , wow , what a let down . They do look cool but even the $ 5 Skullcandy earbuds with poor sound quality sounds better than these . I can not believe this is Koss , I have owned numerous headphones by them but this is just sad .	-1
Based on all the reviews I thought this was going to be a nice set of cans . Unfortunately I 'm very disappointed . I 'm comparing them to the Sony MDR-V6 , which in my opinion rates against headphones in the $ 200+ price range.The PortaPro is not a bad headphone , but its not a good headphone either . The bass is present but muddy . Not clear or crisp at all . The mids have a decent amount of detail but the muddy bass bleeds the mids out quite a bit . And the treble ... . where is it ? I have n't heard a headphone with less treble . This lack of treble futher leads to the overall lack of detail and excitement found in other headphones . Are they worth the $ 25 that I paid ? Yes . But I would n't pay more than that for them . Save up and buy the ~ $ 67 Sony MDR-V6 , its several tiers above the PortaPro , not only in sound quality , but in noise isolation and build quality . If you can afford the Sennheiser HD598 , I also very very highly recommend them as well .	-1
My girlfriend only had these for like two weeks and they just fell apart on her all of a sudden .	-1
Total junk . Installer shut down , forcing a manual installation . Image is grainy , regardless of settings , colors are n't right . Horrible , avoid .	-1
I 'm wearing my headphones now listening to music on my laptop , which is good . The bad news is that my right earpiece is attached with shoe-goo because it broke and there was not enough surface area to just glue the stem piece . That is to say , the whole earpiece is glued solid to its bracket so it does n't move . The over-the-head thing is taped together with packaging tap because it , too , broke when I put the things on my rather large head . They sound fine and all , but I could make a more durable headphone set out of balsa wood . Do not consider these things portable unless your bodyguard is willing to carry them in a padded suitcase.Maybe I should just glue to the earpieces to my head .	-1
After owning these headphones for over 6 months I can tell you that they just do n't compare at all to the Sony MDR-V6 model . The overall sound quality is muddy , flat , and lifeless . The bass tone these cans produce is more of an upper mid-bass rather than a smooth , tight , and deep bass . The mid-range sounds are muddy and offer very little ambient presence to the sound . Highs are more harsh sounding rather than clean and precise . If you 're buying these mainly to listen to music I 'd suggest you look elsewhere as these sound pretty bad . I currently use the Sony V6s ( not the V600s ) for listening to music and some studio work and the difference between them is quite dramatic.The build quality and comfort of the Sony MDR-V600 is about all that is good about them . But , if you want something that sounds accurate for studio monitoring than get the classic Sony MDR-V6 model ( many studios and radio stations use the Sony MDR-V6 or the Sony MDR-7506 headphones for monitoring sound ) . They fold up just like the MDR-V600s and are just as comfortable.If sound quality is important to you then avoid the Sony MDR-V600 headphones like the plague . They 're horrible .	-1
My first pair lasted 16 years . Somewhere along the line , Sony decided to make the plastic film covering the ear pads thinner , that they would wear out after a year or so and need replacing . Most of their headphones are designed this way . After a few months , the ear pads come apart at the seams . Within a year , bits of black plastic will begin to tear off and stick to your face . Within two years , the ear pads will be completely shredded.These are low-quality , overpriced headphones . You will do better with other brands .	-1
I work from home and use my home phone at least 3 to 4 hours a day . I have Panasonic and have used Panasonic headsets previously . After I cycled through two of them , I decided to give this one a try . I just got it in the mail and it has 3.5 mm jack . My home phone takes 2.5mm jack . There is no information in the product description about the headset jack size so I relied on some of the reviews where people used it successfully for home phone . I also had someone comment that they also received a jack adapter 3.5 to 2.5 mm . I did not get that so this is useless for me.I will be contacting the vendor for a return . Disappointing !	-1
Awkward to use and the pieces were difficult to put together ( the padded ear cushion would NOT go on ... and no instructions were provided ) . Uncomfortable on my head and basically more trouble than it was worth . Will keep trying to find a good & # 34 ; plug-in & # 34 ; headset for my iPhone as an alternate to bluetooth . My biggest problem was that it was n't clear from the description that I HAD TO ALSO ORDER the 2.5 - 3.5 adapter in order for the plug to work with my iPhone 4 . Went all over trying to find such an item to no avail ( even Best Buy did n't carry anything ) . Trying to return it .	-1
Excited about this based on good reviews , but did not have the same experience.Tested on my Nexus S cell phone , person on the other end complained about static and poor quality sound . I unplugged headset and switched to using my cell , and they said the problem went away , so unfortunately problem seems to be with this headset.Also , just FYI , this does not come retail packaged , but shows up in a plastic bag with no instructions . Not a problem for me , but makes me wonder where these are from and the quality .	-1
you sent me the wrong item . the item you sent me was suppose to go to MR. FELIZ BIRDI . WROONG ITEM/i really do n't know what your going to do .	-1
USB Cable was dead on arrival . Not cool considering I ran it through a wall.Today 's lesson : Test your cords before running them .	-1
I connect a USB item to these cables and , maybe , % 25 of the time it works . I have to fiddle with it to really get any connection . I have older , worn out cables that work better than these .	-1
This cable is advertised as having `` 480 Mbps transmission speed '' which is false . On the packaging it says only 12 Mbps , meaning this is NOT a USB 2.0 cable . Be careful ! I would have left one star but thankfully Amazon let me return the cable without any hassle .	-1
It was great out of the box . Within about 6 months the center plug somehow got bent inside so I ca n't plug anything into that one anymore . After 10 months the lock stopped working so when it 's extended I have to put something on the cord to keep it from reeling back in . I should also add at this point the cord may have been pulled out a couple dozen times at most.Update - I opened it up today to see if I could get the lock to work again . Turns out there are 2 plastic cogs that work together and one is mounted on a rivet . It had gotten a little bit bent so straightening it out seems to have fixed the problem . I also cranked the spring up another revolution so it retracts a little more forcefully and all the way to the end . Easy repair with a screwdriver and pair of pliers .	-1
I 've had a 909 for 10 years . It 's gotten several thousand hours of use , has fallen on the floor a few times , and is still going strong.It 's very true that this radio is hard of hearing using its whip antenna . It has inferior sensitivity . I just bought a $ 20 analog SW radio which is vastly more sensitive . You must add your own external antenna . The reel antenna will do nicely . After that , the 909 truly performs . It can hear everything then.The speaker is also poor . It has inferior sound . Again , the $ 20 analog I bought has vastly superior sound to the 909 . The sound on the 909 is disappointing . I only ever listen to it using headphones.The 909 has a tuning knob , which is much better than up/down buttons for tuning . You can tune in 1 KHz increments . That 's fine for SW.The narrow/wide filters are okay . Not great . Using the narrow filter and tuning away from an interfering station can help with the interference.The tuning for SSB is unacceptable . SSB should not sound like Donald Duck in a radio with this price . If you rip off the display glass , you can adjust the BFO screw and almost get SSB to zero-beat . I prefer the BFO knob on the YB 400PE to what the 909 has . Poor SSB performer.The sound mutes when you tune . That is bad . I ripped my radio apart and modded the radio so it would not mute.The radio frequently beeps when you press buttons . This is annoying . I ripped my radio apart and removed the beep speaker.The memory function is very nice . Nearly 30 pages of 9 memories each . Most of them are preprogrammed and out of date . You have to find a cheat online to bypass the memory lock so you can store your own countries and frequencies.Decent FM and MW reception . MW DXers will not be disappointed.No DRM . This is an old radio . If you want DRM , you need to do another mod , buy a mixer/filter chip , pipe the signal into your computer , and decode it with the appropriate software.No synchronous detection . At this price , the radio really should have had sync . It makes a huge difference in terms of listenability . Sync completely removes adjacent interference and fading distortion . If you listen to SW you want it . The 909 does n't have it.I like the 909 . But I must suggest you get the Sony ICF-SW7600GR instead . It is much cheaper . It has much better sensitivity . It has much better sound . It has synchronous detection . Or if your focus is SSB , get the Grundig Yacht Boy 400PE . It is cheaper , has better sound , and zero-beats SSB.Sorry 909-lovers , but your radio is greatly outclassed by the competition .	-1
I 'm revising my rating downward after failing to get my printer to operate consistently with this hub despite its bulky and heavy-duty power supply . When I switched to a lighter Asante 4-port hub , I no longer had any problems . Maybe the problem was in my USB cable , because the D-Link seems to be a solid , well-designed piece of equipment . The price is right , so you could do worse than give it a try for yourself.The D-Link hub initially worked fine with my iMac for lighter tasks . But as Harry Carey would say whenever a fly ball fell short of the bleachers , one more biscuit for breakfast might have insured a home run . Lately I 'm finding that heavy-duty print jobs involving photos are requiring me to unplug the printer from the hub and directly into the USB port of the computer . Occasionally , the unit causes everything to freeze when attached to its power supply , then resumes functionality when I unplug its electrical source ( the instructions claim the unit is 5 times more powerful when run by electricity ) . Fortunately , at these prices you can afford to just toss it and try something else .	-1
This antenna did not work at all . The only good thing I can say is that is was cheap enough that I did n't go to the bother of sending it back , just into the trash .	-1
Worst Drives Ever ! Had 3 fail already none due to excessive heat or impact . The WD drives I purchased at the same time are still going strong . Buy what you 'd like but I 'm sticking with WD .	-1
stay away look for updates in other reviews for failures.Pros : Works fine until it dies ! Cons : I have had 3 failures of this model disk in the last 45 days in 2 different systems . These were not gamer systems and are well cooled in large Antec boxes . Clearly Seagate has a problem and expect additional failures - next time I will put the service / shipping charges towards Western Digital units rather than replacing junk with junk.Cons : ... died without any warning after two months.The return policy is horrible - you are literally not allowed to use packing peanuts , bubble wrap , or newspaper to package a dead drive when you return it for warranty replacement . It has to be 2 inches of foam rubber in a corugated box or your warranty is void.Also , you are sent a REFURBISHED drive as a replacement.You are also required to pay for shipping the drive back , and can wait as long as 30 days from the day they receive it to get your new one.This last point is n't too bad in itself , but when mixed with everything else , it 's stupid.Oh , and the RMA form on the website was down for two or three days before I could actually get it sent in . Customer service could n't even fill out an RMA request for me - the entire system was down for `` maintenance '' .They also make sure to withhold the detail about packing until you already submitted the form ... and possibly gave them $ 20 to avoid waiting a month for your replacemeOther Thoughts : What happened , Seagate ? I have two more of the older 7200.10 drives in here and they 've run absolutely beautifully for the year I 've had them - as a matter of fact , they 're the only thing holding my degraded RAID5 up right now . I still have the old 160GB drive that came with my Dell five years back , and it still works like a charm . I order a couple 7200.11 drives , one arrives DOA and the other dies within two months without any warning.Cons : Had a SD15 failure . Drive was making a high-pitched noise just before it failed on machine reboot . Was able ( with effort ) to get SD1A flashed onto drive . But then drive became very noisy -- every few seconds , it would sound like the head was tracking accross the drive ( a 'farting ' noise , as some have said ) . Performance would also drop to near zero at these times.Got a warranty replacement from Seagate ( which cost me $ 20 ) -- another drive with SD15 ! Sure enough , one week after install this one just started to make the high-pitched noise , so I 'm typing this before I 'm computerless once again.Other Thoughts : I will never , EVER buy Seagate again . I will do everything I can to make sure no one I know buys their products , either . Shame , shame , shame on you , Seagate .	-1
I 'm disappointed to report that my unit blew out after a few days of modest use . It was plugged-into a standard 220-volt outlet in a UK hotel . But it overheated witin 15 minutes and had to be shut down frequently . Now I am using a Tacima step-down transformer . Look into the Proctor-SIlex model as well . This Recoton could n't handle the job , and I was using the 50-watt setting .	-1
It lasted only 2 months , that 's pretty bad for a Router/switch . See if i can get a refund for it . My D-link lasted 5 yrs .	-1
Junk , Only one ethernet port worked . Tech support sucked . Will stay away from net gear . Purchased a china model for 10.00 cheaper and it works great .	-1
Could n't find anyplace else on Amazon to review the Dymo Letra Tags . I am probably returning both models that I purchased . The more expensive model ( QX50 ) has a Qwerty keyboard , but prints horribly , if at all . On a single line of bold text , it printed just about nothing . It prints 2-lines of normal text , with contrast set at the highest level , very irregularly . You can see some letters but not others . This is supposed to be their newer model . The next level down ( a few bucks less ) looks more like a calculator in it 's design ; long and narrow ( N10926 ? ) . It prints really well ; very crisp letters even just at regular contrast . Unfortunately in 2-line mode it will not center the lines , has less symbols ( I need inch marks ) , and requires 6 batteries to the other model 's 5 . ( Perhaps the extra power makes it print better though ? ) I 'm pretty disappointed . The tapes are much more expensive than the old emobossed wheel gun models they make . LetraTag tapes provide only 13 feet of tape . I wanted to make labels for my garden stakes . I 'm going to take a look at the Brother and Casio lines of label makers and hope there 's something better .	-1
I 've used both Replay and their competitor Tivo , and I have to say I 'm much happier with Tivo . For one thing , Replay included Firewire ports on their original unit which they marketed as being available for adding external hard drives . After a year the software still does n't support them and they ca n't say when it will ! I 've also been bitten by quite a few software bugs and find their management mechanism for recorded programs to be byzantine and often surprising . I 've had the unit delete a program I was watching in order to record the latest episode when it had plenty of space and was supposed to keep several episodes of the program . Also , several times I 've gone to watch recorded programs and found that the unit had crashed.Also , if you change recording characteristics for a show ( number of episodes to store , quality , etc ) , Replay deletes your currently recorded episodes ! I 've also had Tivo crash , but only while I was actively using it . Tivo has never failed to record a program for me , and I 've found their interface for managing what to be intuitive and easy to use . Some of Tivo 's programming guides are poorly designed , though.The live pause feature of both Replay and Tivo is wonderful , and Tivo is limited to 30 minutes whereas Replay is limited by the amount of available space ( usually much more than 30 minutes ) .Also , be aware that the quoted times for both Replay and Tivo are for lowest quality recording . You 'll probably find that the lowest quality is TOO low and that you 'll want to use the next best quality , probably halving the available record time.In short , Replay should spending their energy on getting existing products to work reliably , and on supporting features they promised a year ago , rather than introducing new products .	-1
Within a month of purchase , 2 of the 5 channels on this switch were dead . This is unacceptable quality control on such a simple device .	-1
If you buy this product you better pray it works . I purchased this product and it did n't work , sent it back to Amazon to get replaced . Then it still did n't work.You might think that it was my setup but tech support has confirmed that it was n't , and that this is the 2nd 'faulty ' switch . However they have failed to send me an RMA number to send it back to them . I have called every day for the past 2 weeks to try and obtain this elusive 'RMA confirmation email'.As of right now their tech support/customer service 800 number is n't even working or is overloaded.If you buy this product , I hope it works for you . But if you think you might need some service from the company , you may want to think about going to a competitor ( are there any in this price range ? ) .	-1
it came and it turned on and nothing hap-end - ran an ip check on the network and nothing - software program ip check in case they changed the interface ip - the program sees my isp router but not this thing	-1
I really liked this card until I bought a Netgear FS108 10/100 switch . No matter how I configured the LNE100TX card , it would only talk to the switch if I forced it to 10mbps mode . Forcing to 100Mbps would n't work , nor would autonegotiation.If I wanted a 10Mbps card , I would have gotten one . This is a poor performer .	-1
Skip this digital camera and go directly to the Coolpix 880 by Nikon ( also on Amazon ) . Why , you ask ? Well , this Coolpix is quite old ( in terms of digital ) and you 'll be throwing your good money after a badly outdated camera . Here are the details why : Megapixels . The Coolpix 800 takes 2.1 megapixel pictures , but the 880 take 3.1 megapixel . ( More pixels are preferred to less since this will affect your image quality . ANd believe me - you will SEE the difference ! ) Zoom . The 800 has a 2x optical , plus 2.5 digital zoom lens ; however , the 880 has a 2.5x optical and the digital zoom . You always want as high an optical zoom because using pure digital zoom will make your pictures look fuzzy ! Memory . Both the 800 and 880 come with 8 MB of CompactFlash , but most people would agree that this is n't enough . Purchase an additional CompactFLash card for 32 MB or more and you 'll be happy you did.Downloading . The 800 only connects via serial port , but the 880 connects via serial OR USB . THe USB connection is MUCH MUCH faster for downloading pics to yoru computer , but the serial ( 800 's only method ) is horrendously slow.Batteries . THe 800 uses 4 AA batteries , but the 880 uses far superior and much longer-lasting 2CR5 lithium batteries . The 880 's batteries also weigh less.Price . This is the ONLY reason you shoudl consider the 800 ( $ 499 ) over the 880 ( $ 699 ) . But let 's face it , if you have $ 499 for the 800 , you should fork over the extra $ 200 and get the 880 so you can have a digital camera that will last you more than a year . The 800 is being phased out by Nikon . RUN to the 880 today ! : )	-1
Failed after two months of use while only having a 42 inch tv plugged into it . Inferior monster product . I would n't buy again . It seemed a good price for the item but not worth the headache .	-1
Looks and feels nice , but broke after two weeks . I used it for rather high power appliances ( 3kW total ) though .	-1
I 've used Monster surge protectors in the past and had no reason to complain but when put to the test , this one totally failed me . This is your basic surge protector strip , with right angle plug and color-coded plugs for various audio-visual components . But does it give them sufficient protection ? Unfortunately it did not for me . I was using it for my Tivo-TV combination and a bad storm one day fried the hard drive in my Tivo . So dock a few stars for it failing to properly protect my device . So now I get to experience this Monster warranty process . Suffice to say , you will be lucky if you get anything out of them , or can fulfill the requirements and 3 pages of information they want you to send them . In my case , I have a Tivo DVD that no one within several hundred miles of me is `` authorized '' to repair as they require , and they require an inspection of the damaged equipment by such a technician prior to filing a claim . I have to order a replacement part on the internet , which they do n't accept and they wo n't reimburse after the fact . You also have to pay to send the surge protector back to them for inspection as well , so basically you have to spend a significant amount of money to file a claim and may get absolutely nothing out of it . So basically , the warranty in a lot of cases is of little use and not worth the trouble they put you through versus just paying for repairs yourself . So you can dock another star or two for that . So while I like the design of this surge protector , I probably will go looking for another one that will properly protect my equipment at least .	-1
I do n't know how Monster charges these prices with a straight face . My cable guy said `` we do n't use these '' -- `` not recommended '' -- `` does not improve reception '' . My cable company uses standard , red-labeled , lower cost , 5-1000mhz splitters . They work just fine !	-1
In my first review a failed to mention what systems and software I was running . I believe this may be the cause of many people 's woes ... I run these cards on 3 very different systems : 1 ) AMD athlon 1ghz biostar mb 2 ) Intel p90 `` Micron '' who knows what kind of mb 3 ) Intel p133 `` Gateway '' ditto on the mbBut , for all three , I am running windows 98se ( second edition ) .I believe the determining factor in getting your PC 's to talk to each other using this device and provided drivers is having the same operating system on each platform.As I recall , during software installation for the Netgear cards , I was required to `` insert the windows installation CD '' for the complete software installation . As the Netgear software relies on windows networking software this is key to getting these things working . There are a lot of differences between windows95 , windows98 , and windowsME , especially in the area of networking.Netgear 's installation should overcome these differences , or at least document the problems . For this I am downgrading my rating to only 2 stars ...	-1
They do n't last half as long for me as they are advertised which is all i can say . I have used them in digital cameras and dslr camera equipment .	-1
I highly recommend NOT getting this unit . The Garmin unit does n't work well enough to do anything with . I 'm up high on a mountain with great sky coverage , lots of satellite lock in , awful inaccuracy . Waste of money .	-1
This is a bad CompactFlash Card . Compare with Viking ( I bought two from an internet store because it should be the best one ) , SimpleTech , Microtech , 128MB Compact Flash Card . SanDisk CompactFlash Card read and write speeds are so bad . I use CANON PRO70 and CANON D60 camera , which have RAW format . SanDisk CompactFlash take twice time to read and write data . Even the newest SanDisk Ultra CompactFlash does n't work faster than others . However , its price is so high.You could get full test review on-line.If you use basic digital camera with below 2.0 megapixels resolution and save with JPG format , it is ok for you with 128MB . Otherwise , please do n't buy this one . Choosing other company 's CompactFlash is better for you .	-1
I used this 128MB Sandisk CF card with my Nikon 885 digital camera on a recent trip to Vietnam . While it does store plenty of high quality images , the issue I have with this card is the read/write rate . As the card fills up with pictures it becomes slow to store the picture you just took . I estimate that this took up to 15 seconds , an eternity while waiting to take another picture . Even more painful is reviewing and deleting pictures . Going through thumbnails of about 100 pictures took 5-10 minutes as the camera struggled to read from the memory card . I also took along a Lexar 16MB 8X card that displayed my pictures almost instantaneously . This is a lower capacity card but it gave me a comparison . Sandisk does n't do a very good job of stating its read/write speeds . These speeds ( along with # of MBs ) is what distinguishes mainstream from professional quality cards . Professional photographers do n't have time to wait to take another picture or review their older pictures . I am buying a large capacity Lexar 12X card to be my primary high storage card and the Sandisk card will be my backup for overflow situations .	-1
! ! ! ! BUY A MAXTOR AT YOUR OWN PERIL ! ! ! I have a Dell 1Gig , 512 machine , with the Maxtor 40G hard-drive as part of the initial build . Less than two weeks after my machine came off Warranty , the drive failed , completely and utterly.In breaking down my box , I found that the warranty was marked on the outside of the HD as `` aug 03 '' ( it 's presently jul 03 ) . So I called Maxtor . They claimed the HD warranty ended in May 03 . The rep asked me to `` send proof '' , which after some further discussion was a fax sent to Maxtor ( which I had to send 3 times ) . After getting Maxtor support to help for about 15 minutes , they suddenly said , `` this drive was OEM 'd by Dell and as such you have to deal with them . '' When I pointed out that the warranty was still good according to the HD , I was handed around and eventually told , `` tough luck '' .I 'm going to try my luck with Western Digital .	-1
I own two such drives . Both failed in less then two years , one completely , the second one still works if mounted & quot ; upside down & quot ; ( otherwise the motor can not start ) . I think there are some motor reliability problem with this particular drive and it is more common that one can assume from the posts or WEB research . May be similar to IBM 's problems , but I may just have a bad luck . I also own 4 I Western Digital drives with 8MB cache and they all are still alive . Again this might be a coincidence , but please be careful before buying this drive , especially as a replacement .	-1
This thing is a dinosaur at this point . Are they even selling it ? I would n't waste my money on it .	-1
I do n't understand how these get more than one star.They are poorly constructed and I could n't get them to focus.Believe me , I 'm not a binocular snob , these are crap . The knob sticks , they feel cheap and the image is poor.They should be putting these in cereal boxes . Seriously , they are not worth the effort of ordering and carrying around your neck.I sent them back .	-1
Within days of receiving this product , the rubber around the eye piece fell off . Not a big deal , but annoying nonetheless . The quality of the optics of the binoculars leaves much to be desired , but of course , that is a function of the price . In humid and wet conditions the binoculars just did not hold up . The lenses were always fogged and then a permanent cloud settled in the lenses , making them almost useless . I just left them somewhere when I was traveling . On the plus side , they are small , light and convenient to carry around . Would not buy again , even though they are inexpensive , it just is n't worth the $ 20-30 that I spent on it . If casual birding in your backyard is all you will be doing with these , this is the product for you . Otherwise , do n't bother .	-1
I ordered two of these to keep in the car . One of them had to be returned as it was out of alignment and resulted in vertical double vision . Not very good quality control . The one that worked was fine but I gave them two stars to call attention to the bad one and warn customers to check them carefully on arrival .	-1
Not having done my homework , and knowing nothing about binoculars , I mistakenly expected a higher magnification to be better - not ! Using these 16 x 32 binoculars is like viewing through lenses held by someone with Parkinson 's Disease - very shaky ! I kept checking my hands - which did n't feel shaky at all - to make sure they were n't actually shaking , and they were n't . Later I read that binoculars with higher magnification produce very shaky images unless the binoculars are held still as with a tripod.Worse , you have to constantly adjust these if you try to view to the left , right , towards you , or farther away . In short , a pain in the butt . I get eye strain and headaches after just a minute or 2 of using these . A waste of money . No , I wo n't buy a tripod ; I bought these because they were cheap and because I did n't want to spend much money for the limited viewing I 'd be ( hopefully ) doing . I ordered a pair of 10 x 50 , and will see how they work out ... .	-1
Very convenient to use , nice focusing , rubber eye cups , but you get what you pay for . Binocular users do n't usually realize what they 're missing until they check out Nikon or Minolta binocs . The images focus into crystal clarity but the price is close to a hundred or more bucks . But it 's like a digital camera . It does n't matter what the features are if the images are crappy.The lenses in these binocs have rings around the inner perimeter that are always out of focus . The center image is pretty good until you compare it with better binoculars , then there are more colors , a brighter image and , of course , consequently , greater viewing pleasure.Also , like most lens caps on binoculars , the lens caps on these should be discarded with the plastic wrap and box . They fall off with gravity and you 'll soon lose them anyway.This one 's a good model for kids . For yourself , use your tax cut and buy a more expensive model . If you 're going to walk 12 miles into the woods , you deserve to have primo optics .	-1
Received these today . Made sure the interpupillary distance and the diopter were set correctly and the binoculars still produced a double image . The factory seals on the package indicate these were not previously returned or tampered with . They either slipped past quality control , or were somehow knocked out of alignment during shipping.Binoculars that ca n't handle a 2 day trip in shipping are n't durable enough for field use , and if they left the factory like that , QC needs to be more vigilant . In any case they are unusable in this condition.It 's a shame because they otherwise appear to be good build quality . The fit and finish was nice . But I need to look through them , not just look at them .	-1
I have owned this unit for six months . Everything was fine until I built a new PC and attempted to set the PPPoE for the new PC . After accessing the Setup Menu and making the necessary changes , everytime I hit `` Save '' I would get the logon/password window , and could n't get past it.Multiple calls to Linksys Tech Support were routed to India , where I was repeatedly instucted to uselessly reset the modem . Finally , they told me to RMA the unit . I was not happy when I discovered I was required to pay for the return shipping of the suspect unit , even though my unit was still under warranty.The replacement unit arrived and I wired it up : SAME PROBLEM . Infuriated , I called again . The guy who answered listened to my description of the problem said `` I know how to fix that '' , and had me make one change in Windows : VOILA , it worked.Now I had to return the unnecessary replacement router , again , on my nickel . When I expressed my frustration with all the previous CS reps who did n't know the solution , here 's the really funny part : He asked me `` Were you talking to India ? '' Yes , I said , and he replied , `` The Indians are all idiots . We 're in the Philippines . Next time you have a problem , make sure you 're talking to the Philippines . `` Well , there you have it : The Third World at war with itself for America 's hearts and minds . Linksys corporate should be proud . SHEEEEESH !	-1
This router seems to have problems creating connections . As long as a computer stays up and connected , everything seems ok . However , upon computer reboot it may take several tries to obtain a connection from this router . Tried updating the firmware since the firmware was out-of-date but because of bad documentation and a clunky update method the router was temporarily & # 34 ; bricked & # 34 ; . Thank gawd others with the same router posted remedies online ( see ? The process & # 34 ; bit & # 34 ; other folks too ) and after a very painful half-day of work the router was back . Original problem was not fixed , however .	-1
Bought this to replace a D-Link router that is getting flaky and spent an entire frustrating afternoon with it . IP obtained , no network capability . Updated the firmware even , no help . The website offered advice on resolving that in no way matched any software either available on the website , or the software that came with the product . Finally I plugged back in my D-Link and am temporarily back in business - will look elsewhere for a solution . At least the D-link came with understandable software and a website that is comprehensible .	-1
I read reviews ( but not on usenet ) about how great this router was - but when I started using it with my linux and windows 98SE boxes attached to an @ home cable modem , I noticed that EVERY ftp download and every other image had checksum errors . Very odd - in my 20 years of BBS/Cerfnet/Internet experience , I had NEVER seen CRC corruption issues.The user experience was that ftp was COMPLETELY broken , and that every fifth image on a webpage would look like noise.Linksys has a firmware upgrade - and even after applying the thing , I still have connection refused issues and corrupt downloads that mysteriously go away when I take the router out of the picture . Terrible.I returned mine and got a NetGear router . Make sure you do some usenet research - or be prepared to take it back - this seems to be a common problem with this router - it even refers to the corruption problems in the & quot ; Frequently Asked Questions & quot ; that came with the thing . It tells you to use a different ftp client - hah ! - as if that would fix their hardware issue ! Oh well . Viva la competition .	-1
Yes , this router is easy to use , setup and does exactly what you would expect . However , it 's disposable . Expect to buy another one within a 2-3 years . After just over 2 years , mine died ( it only came with a 1 year warrenty ) . While it still works , I have to reset it by unplugging it and then plugging it back in several times a day ( like 10-20 ) . Then you have to wait about a minute for all the computers to deal with the reset . This sort of disposable lifespan seems pretty par for the course for Linksys consumer products.I was gullible enough to replace my first with a second ( like I said they are cheap and cheap ) . The second has lasted longer but every time the house power goes out I have to reset the router using Linksys ' Netset utility which means physically connecting a computer directly to the router - which is a pain for me since I keep it in a closet next to my patch panel . Netset works fine except it is Windows only . So , Linksys are not Mac friendly ( though Macs will work with their products ) .So this is my last Linksys product . I replace my Linksys wireless AP with an Apple Airport Extreme - much more stable.So in short , with Linksys - you get what you pay for - they are cheap and cheap .	-1
Two reasons I bought this : 1 . To move all my computers behind a router so I would n't have to leave one on all the time ; and 2. to be able to handle inbound FTP connections to my FTP server . The router functioned acceptably for basic functions ( easy to configure , etc . ) , but inbound FTP connections would consistently fail after transfering a few thousand bytes . Each failure would require that the router be reset.This item is probably OK for most people , but it could n't handle the one primary thing that I needed , hence the low rating . It 's now running as a replacement for my old hub ( also a LinkSys ) which has an overheating problem . You 'd think I 'd learn ...	-1
I returned this item because I could not get it to work with my computer . However to be a refurbished item , it looked practically new . No problem returning it .	-1
What they do n't tell you is that the item works with very limited OS systems and there has n't been a firmware update forever to accommodate newer OS . Sent this back right away .	-1
I had a poor experience with Sennheiser as a company . I received a pair of HD 265 's . These are not inexpensive headphones and wanted closed not open headphones . I unpacked the product and put them to my ears and they broke in half . I had a piece of headphone in each hand . I called the seller and they said send them bak to the manufacturer . Nothing like like making the customer responsible for a problem . I sent them back to Sennheiser and asked if I could upgrade to a better headphone such as the 600 's and that I would be happy to pay . I have to give Sennheiser credit . They did call and offer to uprgrade for $ 250 plus the HD 265 . I explained that I could get a pair of 600 's on Amazon for less than that and keep the 265 's . That did not seem to matter to them . I guess they could not follow the logic of pay more and get less.My suggestion is to stay away from Sennheiser alltogether and take a look at Ultrasone , GRADO , or Pioneer.Unlike the Ultrasone 's these headphones the 600 's have an in your head sound as opposed to the much more natural sounding and accurate Ultrasone 's . These headphones are also very tight and uncomfortable and connot be worn for long.Although I own a pair of Sennheiser noise cancelling headphones which I like , I prefer to give business to a company with more character . I also think there are headphones with a much superior build quality and superior sound such as the Ultrasone and GRADO headphones . When it comes to reviews most people purchase headphones and do not compare and write a review about the only headpohone they have really listened to . The initial impression of most quality headphones is mindblowing . That was my initial mistake . Now I have experiences GRADO 's Ultrasone 's and STAX 's . Save your money and do n't buy a name , buy a headphone .	-1
I bought this cause I needed something fast and did n't want to spend a lot of money . The unit ok ok . It eats batteries fast and picture quality is mediocre at best . I should have ponied up the cash for a better camera .	-1
Bought two of these cameras to take photos for insurance purposes . There was no flash when I took the photos , so when I called the company they confirmed that was correct . When I took another shot , there was a flash . Needless to say , nothing came out . Can anyone recommend a digital ?	-1
I have had this unit ( DI-701 ) for a year or so and recently found a problem in addition to the security hole thats posted here.I upgraded to the newest firmware 4.10 because I needed the IPSec protocol that the 4.06 didnt have and it seems to work fine until I tried to access Netflix.com . The unit totally halts . All lights stay on and the unit can not be found through its configurator . I have to recycle the power to the unit to get it back up and running again.I called tech support and they told me to call Netflix and ask them what ports they are using to send back http requests . I told him that Netflix didnt have a tech support since they do not provide hardware . And it should n't be the case since I was able to access Netflix with the 4.06 firmware . Who knows what other site it can not access . So to the recycling bin it goes !	-1
my onboard LAN went out on a gigabyte motherbaord . darn right ? the way the connectors go , the metal outside would have to be inside let alone go through my motherboard before it would connect . I of course sat there trying to figure it out , and realized it would n't work so I gave my UPS uncle the package with a return label and sent it back . I would not recommend this unless your motherboard is upside down , where the smaller part of the pci port is closer to the outside of the shell	-1
D-Link makes low-end NIC 's . My problem with them is why they 're made so awfully . Quality is so inconsistent . Their help desk is indifferent to the card 's many installation problems . D-Link 's diagnostics work only in DOS ( ? ) .Skip this one ...	-1
A thousand versions of MP3 and Ipod type players . Numerous small radios that you must listen thru earpieces and not thru speakers . Why is it that not a single manufacturer can build a small pocket radio that has a digital tuner and direct tuning push button presets as in your automobile . Radio Shack built a couple of version some 5 to 10 years ago and they were excellent . I have had 3 or 4 of them but all have now broken and RS no longer offers ( they do offer a rather miserable version that has presets but you must scan thru all presets to get to the station you wish ) . Could you imagine doing that on your television set with some 2 hundred channels ? This seems such an obvious product instead of the 1001st version of another MP3 player . There are those who carry a radio in their pockets when walking ( think postmen ) , going to the beach , working , hiking , camping etc . This is a natural and yet no one builds such a unit that I can find . Again Radio Shack had such a unit some years ago ( a couple of models -- I would suggest a couple of ergonomic improvements but on the whole they were excellent and some bean counter at RS decided to no longer offer them ) . Sony has such a unit , but you can only listen via an earphone ( not thru a speaker ) . Someone once told me that the key to business success was always to know what the chikens are eating .	-1
The sound is just fair - Cheap Sony headphones sound much better . And despite purchasing these through Amazon Prime , the seller was going to let me return them after I paid shipping and reshelfing fees , which together added up to more than the headphones . I had purchased two sets and this return applied to only the unopened set . Now I have two worthless headphones .	-1
I dont do well with headphones they irritate my ears . I itch when I use them so , if you dont have that problem then order these . For the price your cant go wrong . For the kiddies they are a bit too cheap and wont hold up under the hard useage .	-1
I bought my first set of these in June , 2010 for $ 4.27 . Great price for the sound quality . Ten months later , for no discernible reason , the left earpiece went out.OK , I figured , they were only $ 4.27 - besides , perhaps I did something to cause it ( unlikely , because I 'm gentle with my electronics ) .So , I bought another pair in April of 2011 for $ 4.80 ( tax this time , doncha know ) . This pair lasted six months before it became necessary to wiggle the plug to get the left headphone to work.If you do n't mind replacing these every 6-10 months ( that 's my experience , anyway ) , these are a great budget pair of headphones : they sound good , and are comfortable . I 'd prefer to pay double , or even triple , the price and have a set that would last for at least a couple of years.Why must so many products be designed this way ? ! It 's bad for the environment , and it 's inconvenient for me .	-1
I returned this because the headphone jack did n't connect well with my samsung smart phone . I use the phone with several other sets of headphones and do n't have this problem with any of them . If I compare the plug with the other headphones that work I ca n't see a difference so I 'm assuming that it 's minor but enough to cause a problem .	-1
I bought these headphones for use with my iPod . While I do spend up to 20x the price of these for home usage , I do n't like spending too much on phones for my iPod as they get beat up easily . I figured five bucks , good reviews , worth a shot.These headphones sound bad . I do know these are quite cheap , but I 've still heard better even for this price . The problem is the sound is plain tinny . Even with some equalization in the mix , I could n't get `` good bass '' or a full sound out of these . Also the midranges , specifically the upper mids are screechy and overproduced . Another issue is the volume . I have to crank up about 70 % of my recievers volume for moderate volume , and the iPod is even worse . Yes , they are cheap and comfy , but they sound as good as they cost . I 've found that both the Sony Walkman headphones ( MDRA110 ) and the Coby CVH42 for the same price sound better .	-1
I bought two sets about six months ago because they were cheap . While the sound is good , the fit is terrible . Both failed within four months -- likely due to stress on the cords . They also do n't have a volume control and they are not good for television watching , if that 's what you had in mind . I believe they are under warranty , but at this price , it 's not worth the postage to send them to Sony .	-1
When I first received these glasses , I was happy ... lite and perfect ... but , they never aligned properly ... I had one image slightly higher and one slightly slower than the other ... I have to give full credit to Amazon ... they immediately gave me a credit and I purchased the Barska Gladiators which I love ... and they showed up the next day ! ! ! ! !	-1
I really wanted to like this Jornada . But when I got it it just did n't feel right in my hand . The cover - which apparently others like - I hated it . The requirement to store the stylus in the cover is okay , but when you do n't use the cover and put it in a pack or case there is no where to store the stylus - that can be a problem.The screen is not as bright as I had hoped . I am new to Windows based handhelds , but in PocketPC OS it is EXTREMELY difficult to shut down an application , and when you get 10 or so different things running it gets SLOOOOOOOW.HP usually turns out intuitively designed products , but the wheel for scrolling is useless due to its placement . The aforementioned placement of the stylus holder was an issue , and then comes my biggest complaint : the CF slot cover . This little flimsy piece of plastic which is designed to cover the empty ( or full ) CF slot , but it is very cheaply made and poorly attached - I gave it about a week before it would have broken off ; and its placement was such that I hit it all the time.The multimedia was fair , mp3 files sounded good with or without the headphones , but the player ... [ is poor ] and I never could get any sort of avi or mpeg video files to play as indicated . Even with USB connection , it took forever to download mp3s to the 548.COST - VERY EXPENSIVE ! For that price it should be manufactured with better materials.There are virtuosly no accessories for it . An external keyboard is nonexistant . There are two companies with ads in the Accessory guide who show external keyboards , but upon further checking - neither makes one for the 540 series of Jornadas.If you want to really be efficient , I would reccomend the HP Jornada 690 it has the same memory with better battery life , an internal modem , a built in keyboard and more.It works as promised , but is n't as exciting or valuable as it claims . In time , I am sure there will be better accessories and programs , but for now - I 'll keep my paper organizer and pen , its faster , cheaper , and unlimited storage ! Palm organizers are simpler and , in most circumstances , better ; unless you NEED color and multimedia .	-1
I do n't believe that these batteries are fresh . They seem to arrive already weak from age drain or some other issue . For the price they are not even as good as the readily-avilable AA 's .	-1
This is more a review of the seller than of the product . I ordered from Best Deal Supply and the battery was not only different from what was pictured ( it was a different Energizer CRV3 ) it was loose in a paper bag so I had no way to check the expiration on the battery . When I put it in the camera it seemed like it barely had enough juice to turn the camera on . This continues to be a problem , so I am guessing they sent a very expired battery . I have used the Emergizer Lithium Photo ( silver and blue one ) before , from other sellers , and they worked great , but the one 's being sold by Best Deal Supply are not a best deal , so just be careful which company is filling your order and you will probably be fine .	-1
I added these batteries to an order of a few other things , and did n't realize that they were going to ship this separately from Circuit city . Make sure if you pick this , that you are getting something else from CC , or else you will end up like me . With a huge box ( you could fit 4 Tom Clancey novels in the box ) shipped to you with a pack of batteries and end up paying more for shipping then you spend on the batteries !	-1
At first I bought this item it worked okay and was better then having to plug my camera in all the time , but after starting to conflict with other software it would lose contact with my computer after a couple uses . I would have to re-boot to re-establish contact . I ended up tossing this product . I recommend a Kodak reader for your Kodak cameras .	-1
Have used the Fine Pix for 8-months now.My PERSONAL experience with it : Pluses : Reliable , easy to operate , nice combination of features , small and handy ( but see below ) , battery life : ok for about 25-35 pictures.Minuses : Have to work hard to get sharp pictures - usually I do not succeed ; not really a 'pocket ' camera ; red-eye reduction never worked with my kids.Overall : If you can get it for $ 300 it is a good deal , current price of $ 500+ seems too expansive for what you get .	-1
I bought this lens on a killer clearance deal after missing an opportunity for some nice shots of a coyote . I just wanted a simple lens for an occasional wildlife snapshot . The image quality was so bad , I took it right back to the store . It is unlikely my expectations were too high , as I love my Rebel XTi ( 400D ) kit lens , which is considered one of Canon 's worst . I picked up a Tamron lens of similar focal length and have been reasonably happy with it . I 'd steer clear of this one unless you just want an SLR to look cool .	-1
This lens is cheap , and for a reason . It wo n't focus sharply when the aperture is wide open , so it 's hard to get shots with a narrow depth of field but sharp focus on the subject . Its high f-number means you pretty much need sunlight or a tripod to avoid camera shake , and forget about action shots unless it 's full sunlight . It also has very bad chromatic aberration ; this may be corrected by a UV filter , but I have n't tried it . It shows purple halos around dark objects when they 're set against a bright background.The lens does have very nice autofocus , though . It 's very fast , especially after it 's found the general distance of your subject and it just has to make minor corrections for different shots.Overall , this is a good lens for learning to frame shots and use a zoom lens , but its quality is low and it 's not good for much more than learning .	-1
I admittedly bought this in a bit of a hurry , as it was for a nearly-late birthday gift for my son , who had just moved into a new apartment and wanted a router for his new cable service . The reviews for this model sounded good - and I have another model from Linksys that works fine - so I took the bait . Bad decision ! If I 'd read the review dates more carefully , I 'd have noticed that most of them were many years old , going back to 2001 or earlier ! This I failed to do , however ( my bad , I know ) .I knew something was out of whack when I opened the sealed package , and discovered a layer of dust coating the top of the router . The included ethernet cable refused to plug into the back of the router - a bad cable end - so I replaced it with a cable of my own . Entering setup , I found a primitive UI and limited set of choices ; there was enough there , though to set it up for what he wanted . But it was all looking older and older . . . ! Unfortunately , the router would n't work right away , and after getting information from the cable company to no avail , we called Linksys support to get configuration help with our `` brand new '' router . We were told that it was out of warranty ! No , I said , it 's brand new ! Checking the model and serial numbers , the tech assured us that it was indeed well out of warranty and offered to provide support for a charge of $ 29.95We turned down that generous offer and figured the configuration out for ourselves . Properly configured , it has worked fine for the last week . But I call it unethical to fail to mention in the product description that the new product you are purchasing is NOT COVERED by the expected manufacturer 's warranty . Knowing that would have altered my buying decision.Prospective buyers , be aware that you will not be able to get support for this router without paying a fee - this thing has NO WARRANTY COVERAGE from the time you open the box . It may be new to you , but not to Linksys .	-1
I do not know why this thing got all those great ratings ; unfortunately I bought this on the strength of those reviews . It seems great when you set it up , but you will find it has the most annoying habit of losing the connection VERY frequently . If you have an always on broadband connection , do n't get this unless you just miss the old days of dialup and waiting to reconnect every time you want to get onto the Internet . It 's certainly the cheapest thing out there ; spend more and get something else ! Furthermore , Linksys tech support is non-existent ; they do not respond . I had decided to return this , only to find that my wife had just thrown away the box the day before and now I am stuck with it . I will wind up paying twice to replace this peice of trash . By the way , the next model up ( BEFSR14-4port ) has the same problem ( from what I have read of other reviews ) . If you still want to take a chance , just save the box and the receipt !	-1
I bought this 6 years ago but should have returned it immediately . Although I live in a large city the FM reception is practically non-existant . The antenna has to be set just right to pick up the strongest station in town , but even that dissolves in interference when a person or pet walks across the room or a car goes down the street . I 've tried the antenna at different lengths and attached wires and foil to it to no avail . The AM reception is no prize either ; the box has to be re-oriented just right every time you change the station.Now the CD player is dying . At first cleaning the lens helped a little but not anymore . Either the disc wo n't play at all or only plays the first few tracks , then spins out of control making a chattering noise . This is after very light CD use over the years . When it works it only plays factory CDs ; it does n't take CD-RW or mp3 , and is very touchy about CD-Rs.That leaves the dual cassette players ... .they make a lot of mechanical noise when playing , and dubbing from deck to deck yields poor quality copies . Of course the cassette decks are purely mechanical , meaning they ca n't be remote controlled.This box convinced me Sony 's days as a quality brand are over and is only cruising on its past reputation . The products lately are in the same class as Emerson & other cheapie store brands - preferring visual flash to catch kids ' eyes while disguising junk inside .	-1
this head set works like it says it does , but it is cheply made and no good for motorcycle use .	-1
Plantronics T20 : 90 % PERFECT , 10 % DEADLYThis would be the perfect headset phone if not for a few deadly missteps that led me to return it.Perfect : -- Quality build ( solid ) , the right size , the right features ( buttons for mute , hold , redial , conference , and flash , plus volume and tone controls ) . And the mute has a red indicator so you do n't forget ( although I 'd prefer an indicator that flashed like on the Polycom conference phones ) . -- Also , high quality sound in the headset - I could hear the other party perfectly , with only a faint background hiss.Deadly , starting with the most serious : -- The people I talked with said that I sounded distant . It appears that the microphone does n't come forward far enough to pick up my voice well. -- The headset cord is not shielded and picks up noise from the computer . In particular , I had to be careful to route the cord so that it avoided the keyboard or it picked up a loud tone both parties heard. -- The headset cord is very thin and I worried that a minor mistake ( such as catching it in a closing a desk drawer ) would seriously damage it. -- There is no headset for the T20 that covers both ears ( binaural ) . I called to verify this . Although the headset jack in the base is physically compatible with the binaural headset from my M12 , the headset from the M12 does not work with the T20.It seems like they could make this the perfect phone just by making a few straightforward engineering changes . But until then ... PS - There was always a low hiss in the headset . In looking into noise-canceling technology , I learned that these systems typically introduce a hiss of their own . In a noisy environment , you do n't notice the hiss because the noise the circuitry takes out is much greater than the hiss it adds . But in a quiet environment like mine , there is no benefit to the noise-canceling feature and you hear the hiss . I ca n't guarantee that this was the source of the hiss I heard , but it seems likely . ( There is no way to disable the noise-canceling circuitry . ) I do n't think the Amazon listing mentions the noise-canceling feature of this phone , but it 's on the box .	-1
Bought it . Returned it.Pros : -It reads mp3's-It comes with a reciept.Cons : -Overpriced-Other models have way more options at almost 1/2 the price-skips-doesnt read folders names or songs-bugs galore , turn off it doesnt return to the same song , its sometimes skips 3-4 songs ahead.-sound is poor , and very low . I plugged it into my stereo , had to turn my stereo up full volume just to hear it..and it STILL was low ! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ! Buy the Memorex mp3 player , its everything this should of been , but is n't .	-1
This product does not work with Mac OS 1.4.7 and above , though there is no indication of this in the literature . Logitec tells me that it is discontinuing the item , and will not update the software . BE AWARE OF THIS ! ! !	-1
My old review is below and I still think the ergonomics are great with this tracball . HOWEVER in the last 6 months I have gone through 2 controllers . I have 2 wireless tracballs and 2 broken controllers . I am sorry but there is no excuse for electronics without moving parts to be so fragile . Until logitech builds durability into the controllers , STAY CLEAR OF THESE UNITS and get a corded one.Real shame , these are very wrist friendly designs but 2 breaking without any damage is wrong . Fool me once shame on you , twice is on me.Some have complained that the control part of the wireless mouse that plugs into the USB is too big . I velcroed it to the lid of my laptop and also can stick the wireless trackball unit itself to the velcro on the lid also . That taken care of , this is one excellent ergonomic trackball . Having it now wireless is only that much better.Best trackball/mouse for ergonomics but so far not as durable as it should be.I will try a second one and report back on that one as well	-1
Unfortunately , it does not fit OS sized road handlebars ( 31.8 mm bars ) . Basically , its a worthless lump of plastic to me .	-1
For Cx owners , if a different cover were supplied , it would be a good product . The Cx models are designed to hold the microSD card under the cover . The replacement back supplied with this product does not fit the unit . Garmin could have easily molded a back for this mount that would accomodate BOTH the newer and older versions of the Etrex line with a rubber gasket seal . When you purchase a Cx series GPS , there is a supplied add-on mounting clip for the cover that protrudes and catches items when carrying the GPS off the mount .	-1
The case has a plastic window over the GPS display . Unfortunately , it makes the GPS harder to read , especially if the light is not ideal . Also , the window is a little too small , and tends to cover the top of the screen . Since two of the main menus are at the top of the screen , this is a problem . Although I would like the protection provided by the case , I find I ca n't use it .	-1
There 's nothing wrong with this product , it works as advertised , I just do n't like it . The reason why I do n't like it is because it 's not that convenient to access the garmin . I have to either take it out of the protective skin , or pull out the carrying case altogether . Again , this is totally my fault that I do n't like it , there was no false advertising at all , but if I had a chance to purchase it all over again , I would n't .	-1
After reading rave reviews about the capacity , I was confident the bag would accommodate my Rebel xsi body , one short lens and multiple other accessories.Big disappointment.The bag held only the camera body and lens -- just barely . This rendered the bag entirely useless.The bag is very attractive . I can not attest to its ruggedness or reliability , as other reviewers have done.If you have a Rebel xsi , choose the bag made for that camera . It is n't as attractive , but it is a much better choice for that camera and lots of gear .	-1
The bag looks great , and was well made what I did not like is it was just too small for me . If you just have a point and shoot camera this is all you would need but anything else , and it will not be enough space .	-1
When I bought this item I was sure that I had finally solved my quandary of wanting a fully functional PDA combined in one unit with a versatile and easy to read Ebook . Unfortunately the Ebookman misses the mark.The unit fits in the hand very nicely and its rubberized grips make it a joy to handle . The unit is also very light which is usually the bane of electronic Ebook readers such as the Rocket Ebook or Gemstar devices . These are the pluses.The negatives soon became apparent . The downloadable OS is a nice idea but does n't work consistently . The unit is prone to freezing and crashing making it necessary to reload the OS and setting the unit back up . You do n't have to re-enter all your data but you do have to set it up for name and other specifics . Quite a pain . Another issue I have is the battery life . I realize that standard alkaline batteries are cheaper for the manufacturer but if you use this item as both a PDA and regular Ebook device you will need to replace both batteries several times a week . This is a little expensive and inconvenient in my book so I would have liked to see a rechargeable battery with the cradle being the charger.There were several other problems I had with the unit . I thought the device was very slow . I would press for actions and it would delay a half a second . This delay made games useless and data entry annoying . The display is larger than a palm but still is not quite as nice as the larger Hiebook device or Rocket ebook . The display is very difficult to read without the backlight , which exasperates its power issues.The unit does sync well with Outlook and hopefully the future versions of the OS will only improve the unit but for now I returned my unit . I also find it a bit unethical to make MS Reader one of the big selling points on the box and then only in small print read that they have n't figured out how to make it work yet.Overall a device that shows promise but does n't deliver yet .	-1
After owning the EBM 911 for two years , reading several books on it , and really wanting to like it , I finally gave up in total frustration and threw it in the trash . The main problem is the operating system ... which must be downloaded anytime the batteries run low . What you learn very quickly is that the unit drains the batteries even when it is turned off . So when the batteries die , you lose everything that you 've had on the unit : addresses , books , notes , even the operating system . On a dialup connection , it takes 30 minutes or so to get the OS online and then resynchronize everything so that you get your files back and get the darn thing running again . If you were in the middle of reading a book when it went down , it 's very time consuming to find your place again . While it comes with a CD with the OS , if you have gotten a book from a vendor different from Franklin 's distributors , you sometimes run into little problems of compatibility that have to be corrected . I began to add up all the time I 'd spent messing around with this thing and finally decided that it was a massive waste of time and an aggravation nobody needs in their lives . I was surprised to discover that two other friends had given up on this product long before I did . I wonder how many eBookmans have found their final resting place in landfills . Franklin owes consumers an apology for this ill-conceived piece of junk .	-1
I may have read the specs incorrectly , but these are not the more robust zip ties I was hoping to buy . That said , they came on time and were packaged decently . I do wish that there was a strength/pressure rating to help make purchases easier .	-1
I was looking for a bag that would be big enough to carry my Nikon D300 , 18-200 , 70-300 , 28-70 and 17-35 lenses . Not to mention assorted filters , batteries , flash cards , etc . I thought , after doing quite a bit of research , that this bag would suffice . And I suppose it might , if you carefully tucked everything away in the bag and never actually tried to get at anything . Sure , the bag will hold a bunch of 'skinny ' lenses ( problems stuffing in my 17-35 ) , but those lenses are buried under layers of padding velcroed in such a way that makes all but the exposed camera and attached lens readily accessible . For example , the camera and attached lens has to sit on the 'second tier ' of padding in order to use the 'lens gate ' . Under the body , totally hidden , might be another lens . Another problem with the body and lens sitting high up , is that the bag 's center of gravity is higher up and more prone to dump out your gear . And speaking of velcro , trying to rearrange the pads is sort of like herding cats . Another problem are the storage spaces- there simply are n't enough zippered compartments to hold loose items . The front compartment is less of a pouch and more of a sleeve . The side pockets only velcro shut , good luck if it rains . And inside the top lid ? Great for storing pieces of paper , that 's about it . The bag comes down to personal preference . I misfired by choosing this one .	-1
I have tried two of these cards from Amazon , and neither has worked with my Dell 8100 running Windows 2000 . Eventually , not having endless time to resolve the problems , and getting sluggish and frankly useless tech-support from DLink via their website , I gave up and am getting a refund.Do n't waste your time on this worthless piece of junk .	-1
I 've done everything I can think of short of paying the long distance charge to call tech support to get this card to work . I 've decided to sell the card to a friend and get another one that will work with WinMe .	-1
I am using this for an outdoor speaker setup including 4 sets of speakers on 3 separate outputs . The unit is a nice size and seems to be good build quality . The connectors are solid and I had no issues . My only complaint is that when I only have my zone 2 speakers selected there is still some output to the zone 3 speakers . Its very low volume but noticable.Since this is an outdoor setup its not a big deal for me but keep this in mind depending on your application.Update : After a year or so the unit now seems to play full sound over all three speaker pairs . I have to lower my rating for this .	-1
This is a word of advice to any would-be buyers of the jamcam 3.0 : & quot ; Do n't ! & quot ; . The product is a toy at best . But the real problem ( yes , there is one worse ) is the business practices of this company . Non-existent customer support ( emails bounce ) , invalid toll-free numbers , and unclaimable rebate offers . There is defintiely something fishy going on . I would go as far as to say beware of KBgear in general . I learned at a price . I rate this product a one-star only b/c a zero rating is not possible .	-1
I bought these bacause of the good reviews ; I was amazed upon getting an iPod that the 'phones included with it have so little volume and so little bass . ( I am especially annoyed with that , the whole 'no bass ' thing ; I love rock and roll and I love it loud and punchy as I ride that mountain bike ) . Anyways , I got these and found that they fit well in my ear , looked forward to comparing with the other phones I purchased at the same time , to test them out against the inexpensive Philips phones , the best I 'd found thus far.A horrific comparison . These phones are trash . No volume to speak of . Junky midrange , junky treble , muddy , soft bass , no bass , really ; it 's like listening to music under water , maybe if you have a radio on when you take a bath and then dunk your head under the water - that 's how these headphones sound.I 'm sending them back for refund but even if they did n't refund the dough I 'd not keep them , I 'd gladly cut them up with a smile on my lips , a song in my heart.Buy the Philips HS500 Behind-the-Head Headphones instead . They absolutely rock , great throughout the entire range , loud as can be ( though I 'd have them louder if I could - LOUD is best on that mountain bike ) , clear , thumping bass , great highs , great midrange , all clear . And nine bucks , to boot . I have tried at least twenty pair of phones , the Philips HS500 stand alone , the best .	-1
Not sure if it is genuine or not , but this cable does not work properly . The sound cuts out of the left channel and you have to wiggle the cable to make it work . This is not a good product .	-1
I use this for my iPod in my car . After 4 months of near daily use , it is cutting out the right channel very consistently ; I have to jiggle it to get it working correctly . Total pain when you 're driving . Although , it started cutting out about two months ago , I 've just been putting up with it since then . I will be ordering a more expensive one ( $ 8Mediabridge - 3.5mm Male To 3.5mm Male Stereo Audio Cable - ( 4 Feet ) [ New design accomodates iphone , itouch , smartphone and mp3 cases ] ) in hopes it will last longer .	-1
1 . I have a iPhone3Gs with a case , the cable wo n't get on without removing the case ! 2 . I did manage to use the product for about 10 days ( hence the extra star ) , as I was compelled to do so . I was on a 4000 mile road trip . Shielding is not that good , but good for the price I guess . But somehow the sound quality deteriorated after around 8 days of use . When I moved the cable a little bit , it would go back to normal.I later returned the product as I had already bought a aux cable from radioshack , which I have to say , works flawlessly , I do n't even need to remove the case . Its not too over priced , I think I bought it for $ 7 . I definitely would recommend this over the Belkin . That said , I am a big fan of Belkin products , if it were not for the first issue I would have definitely reordered a replacement !	-1
On my first use , the connector from the wire to the wrist band broke . Its not worth the cost or shiping . I have not been a fan of belkin , and i will never buy another product of theirs again , period . Over priced equiptment with horid quality .	-1
I got the product and tried to hook it up to my pc case to ground my self as i was reaching over the clip broke from the yellow strap . I guess you get what you paid for , good thing is its cheap bad thing is what a waste of money .	-1
Thought it was to remove scratches and stuff but so much for that Ideal . . maybe for tiny scratches It may work !	-1
I purchased this product since it was a `` recommendation '' , along with a case , when I purchased my Fujitsu scanner . This cable does n't even fit the scanner ! I 'm sure it 's a good cable and should be rated higher than 1 star - so take that into consideration . Do Not buy this product as part of a `` bundle '' from Amazon because it 's totally useless and is n't needed for the Fujitsu scanner . I expect better - and normally receive better - from Amazon .	-1
I got this cable because it was a bit more appropriately priced and because of expected Belkin quality . I fail to understand why these cables are so expensive in US ... it just does'nt make sense ! ! I have been buying network/ethernet cables all my life at one-tenth the cost in other countries and hardly ever had issues with them . There is hardly any difference in quality of these products to make them worth anything beyond US $ 5 for a 15ft cable . Anyways seeing the somewhat better price on this product and perfect ratings I ordered this from Amazon . The cable arrived promptly a few days ago and I only got to test the cable out yesterday . To my disappointment the cable did n't work . I am also doubtful if it is a genuine Belkin product because of the cheap feel of the package it came in . Anyways I never expected this even of a fake knock-off product since its very easy to test these cables before packaging or sending them out . Have requested a refund and will probably not order these cables from Amazon again .	-1
I remembered after getting this cable , why I returned 2 years ago . I update my cables every few years , once I switched to this my network basically came to a halt	-1
This set was barely enough to remove the back of my MacBook laptop . I could not replace the battery and had to order another set to get the needed screwdrivers .	-1
Makes typing awkward and the cover looks weird on the keyboard . I guess if I were in an environment rife with nasty stuff potentially spilling on my keyboard , I 'd like this better , since it would probably protect . I was just looking for something to cover the keys and protect the cheapo letter replacement stickers from wearing off again ... this is n't right for that use .	-1
Instructions for installing this card were a nightmare to follow . I bought this card to help my mom out and even I could not understand the instructions which were poorly translated from Chinese . The proper driver was not included on the disk and it was extremely difficult to find a Windows 7 driver . Netgear does not seem to fully support this hardware with windows drivers . I would have sent it back , but the price was so cheap , it just was not worth the hassle . I did learn to never buy a cheap NIC card like this in the future .	-1
Buying this hub could be the worst thing you ever do to your computer . I run Windows XP , and it warned me that this hub is not Windows XP certified . Fine by me , since most hardware is n't , but works just fine.Everything was going fine until I tried plugging in USB peripherals . None of them worked , including my Logitech Quickcam , Epson C80 printer , and Handspring Visor cradle.Later that night , it was driver conflict hell . Before long , I lost my entire Windows XP install due to repeated appearances of the Blue Screen of Death ( yep , it does exist in Windows XP after all ) .Needless to say , I will never buy another Belkin product again , if I can help it .	-1
I 've had this hub for a while and it worked fine ( even though the AC adapter was a little bit clunky ) . But recently I tried attaching an 802.11b receiver via the USB and the thing would n't work after 3 days of use - Windows reported it being an Unknown Device . Plugging into the back of my computer would still report the same problem - I figured the wireless adapter was faulty . But then ... The other day I plugged a trusty Sidewinder into the hub to play some old games . Tonight the same thing happened - Windows now refuses to recognize the gamepad I 've used faithfully for years now . I am convinced this hub is the culprit . Spend a little more money to buy a hub whose quality you can really depend on ! Perhaps this was purely my own experience with a faulty hub , but I 'd strongly recommend you consider another product - you may be putting your expensive electronics at unnecessary risk .	-1
Let 's face it , these are n't high quality automotive parts , there not meant for stress . After a few years of sparingly using this toolkit . The driver magnet fell out , so bits do n't stay in place . The bits are damaged and chipped.There are better sets out there , the wirestripper is a JOKE . Your better off buying a good quality brand name set , snapon , craftsmen , even duralast .	-1
I 'd recommend selecting a different security cable product , especially if you have a PowerBook or MacBook . This one is poorly made , even more poorly documented , and may have permanently damaged my PowerBook G4 . ( Yes , the product web site claims this model is compatible with the PB G4 . ) It 's unclear from the cryptic instruction diagram on the back of the packaging which direction is locked and which is unlocked . ( Hey , would it be so bad to actually use *words* to explain things ? Even in 4 or 5 languages if you like . The diagrams make no sense . ) In the process of trying to get this to work , it appears that the locking teeth chewed up the security slot of my PowerBook . It may have permanently damaged the slot . Needless to say , I will attempt to return the product for a refund.There are plenty of similar products on the market , including others avaiable through Amazon . I 'd suggest trying one of those .	-1
I 'm not exactly sure how the manufacture expects you to use this product on an airplane , as the stabilizing bar behind your head prevents you from leaning back into your seat.I bought this and the Aiwa noise cancelling headphones at the same time . The Koss headphones are going up on eBay .	-1
Amazon is always greatHowever ; these are cheap plastic tools made in china . Something you would purchase from Harbor Freight . Amazon 's return policy is always outstanding . Sorry Belkin	-1
On my third battery in 4 years . Not sure if the UPS is no good or the batteries are . According to the mfg these should last 3-5 years ... no where even close . The battery is a good fit and does work just not for long . Am shopping for another brand of UPS .	-1
We ordered 2 of these APC batteries . We received 1 APC , and another one from a company called `` ABC '' that looks like a cheap knock-off.I could n't believe Amazon was shipping a knockoff after we purchased the original . So I requested a replacement . They apologized and sent one out.We received it , and guess what , it 's another ABC battery ! I complained again , and this time the guy admits if he orders another replacement , it 'll probably happen again , so he 's just going to give us a refund ! WTF , why does n't someone at Amazon ask themselves why they are shipping knock-off products as real products ? If I was APC , I would be pissed .	-1
I can not believe how stiff these keys are . I thought that this was not going to be a big deal , but it was a deal-killer for me . On the plus side , it is angled nicely with a comfortable hand pad . Unfortunately , the hand pad takes up a lot of real estate and can not be removed .	-1
This might perhaps be a good product , but it will only work with a headset that has a quick-release plug . I have not found such a headset -- even the headset I have from Plantronics has the normal 2.5mm plug ( and that one is loud enough so that it does n't need any amplification ) . I 've tried adding on an adapter , but adding extra adapters and connectors can ruin the sound quality or make sound output too weak for anyone to hear.This amplifier plugs into the phone 's handset jack instead of into a 2.5mm/3.5mm headset jack -- this means you have to pick up the receiver and set it down somewhere whenever you want to make or answer a call , instead of just pressing a button to use the phone 's headset feature .	-1
1 year and 7 months after installing these batteries , my APC Smart-UPS 1000 UPS is telling me to replace the batteries . Ridiculous !	-1
I 've owned MANY lens filters throughout decades of shooting.This filter causes Odd Muddy-Mutated Tones..Very weird looking.You Get what you pay for . I recommend , do n't waste your money .	-1
The Panasonic Lumix FZ35 has a really nice Leica super-zoom lens that opens to very wide angle - great feature , very useful . When this filter is mounted on the lens ( it screws onto the end ) the four corners of the frame show the edges of the filter . All four corners are black . Once you zoom in a bit this goes away , but it 's annoying . I do n't know if this is a problem with the filter or the lens but I 'm disappointed .	-1
I needed a CP in a hurry and was on a tight budget for some photography I was going to do out in the desert . Although it DOES have a high degree of polarization , when you are doing landscapes with large areas of sky there is VERY pronounced color banding . Depending on how you have it set , it is very easy to end up with a dark stripe right in the middle of the sky with lighter bands on both sides . I 've not seen this issue with the more expensive CPs .	-1
This is the first Tiffen filter I have purchased in decades and it is a huge disappointment . I remember the older ones having more threads on each side . This filter ( 58MM Circular Polarizer ) is so minimalist it barely has enough threads to fasten to my camera . Trying to rotate the filter is a trick . There is nothing to hold onto and if I am not careful the polarizer can come off the camera .	-1
Honestly , it does not do anything . Literally , nothing at all . Aside from lower picture quality . It is very cheap , so really cant be upset . If you want a Circular polarizer , get something nicer .	-1
I seated this on my Nikon 70-200 2.8 VRII lens , The thread depth is very narrow and difficult to seat on the lens . Unfortunately I have discovered that putting it on the lens was the least of my isues . Getting it off is a whole new challenge in its own right . Might as well order the filter removal tool when you buy this filter . I will say functionally it did a nice job on my photos , but getting this filter off my lens has jaded me on this product .	-1
I 'm confused by these reviews . Amazon , what 's going on ? Am I wrong or does Amazon have to pay more attention to these reviews ? I googled `` close-up attachments '' and went into amazon . No , I did not want a warming filter , polarizer and UV wrapped into a 3 filter package deal . I wanted information on the close-up attachments that usually come numbered 1 , 2 and 3 , indicating each filters relative close-up focusing capabilities.These reviews are a mixture of the above.Pay attention Amazon . And stop profiling my interests and saturating me with offers on items that you are certain I will like ... ..all the while trying to make the automation look personal . Do you people really believe that we consumers are that stupid ? If all that selling is what pays for amazon ... ... ... .you can have it folks .	-1
The most important part of a camera is the lens . And in the lens is glass , and the optics of that glass will in many way set the price and the quality of the lens . That is why proline models , like the Canon L series costs more than the standard models and if you compare them you will see a difference . One thing to keep in mind , is that if you damage the image coming in to the lens , the lens and camera ca n't repair it . The quality of the filter you put in front of your lens will affect the quality of the image you get . Most filters , even some of the top Hoya are just plain window glass , granted some are coated but the optics of the glass are still low quality ! This will affect your image . If you are using a simple basic lens like a Sigma or Tokina then a lower optics quality filter like this wont make much of a difference . However , if you are using a higher grade lens , you need a higher grade filter . The only 2 ground glass filters that I have found are the B+W and Heliopan . They are more expensive , but well worth it ! You get what you pay for ! A UV filter serves a 2 fold purpose.1st it helps to protect your lens and keep it from getting scratches or damaged ! I have seen a camera dropped and the uv filter shattered but the lens was still working and so was the camera . What would have happened w/o the filter , I dont know , but I would guess it would not have turned out so good . I am often out in the outdoors , and the UV filters I use , B+W mostly , have protected my lenses from several scraps and scratches that could have cost thousands to repair or replace ! 2nd the UV filter does filter out some UV light , and thus you will see less haze in some of your shots . Not a Good Circ . Polarizer can also help in this matter as well ! Note if you have a very wide angle lens , like a 10-18MM you should get a slim model UV filter or else you can see black corners in your picts when you are at max wide angle.Hope this helps .	-1
I got this Tiffen filter to protect my new Panasonic FZ28 's lens , and it has just proven that it cost $ 10.81 more than it is worth . I was testing the camera outside during the evening and , as I focused on the city lights , I suddenly noticed that the lights were bouncing off the filter and reflecting into the camera . I took a couple of test shots with the filter , removed it and took another couple of test shots . When I downloaded the images into my computer , there they were : horrible `` ghost '' lights scattered in the dark sky over the real city lights , and only in the photos taken with the filter in place . I know there is a technical term for them -- glare or flare or something else ? -- and I also know that they should n't be there . This obviously means that the Tiffen 46mm Haze-1 is worthless . I want something that will protect my lens but that wo n't spoil my photos.My FZ18 ( which is my mom 's now ) has a Quantaray multi-coated UV filter that never interfered in my photos in any way . I looked for that filter on the web but unfortunately could n't find it . By the reviews here I thought I 'd be okay with the Tiffen . I was wrong , and must now look for a new filter .	-1
It 's not the most clear glass , but it works . However , I bought it for the protection on my Canon 17-40mm lens . It always sounded a little loose and moved easily ... then finally it CRACKED . I 'm lucky it did n't scratch my new lens . I 'm going for the B & W filters from now on . So much for savings , now I 'm paying more than I would have if I just did it right the first time !	-1
This is cheap gear . The only things I can say it does as expected are 1 ) it fits , and 2 ) it will protect your lens 's front element ... mostly.The glass fits the ring poorly and shifts , letting dust get to your lens , thus requiring you to clean your lens 's front element , which presents the opportunity to damage it that you were trying to avoid by installing this `` protective '' filter.The optics are questionable , as other point out.If you 're broke , and just want to keep fingers off your lens , sure . Otherwise , get anything better , like a Hoya , or splurge and get a B+W .	-1
The 58mm UV filter would not fit any of three 58mm Canon lenses in my bag . The threads are just poorly cut . In the mailbox for return already .	-1

glass lense filter rattles in the housing ? ? ? ? I am filling in with this comment to fulfill the word requirement ! dumb requirement .	-1
This filter flares excessively and is unworthy of any optical system . All inventory should be recycled immediately . Once again you do n't get what you do n't pay for . The clear Nikon filter that I replaced this with functions very well .	-1
I got this filter before I understood the difference between cheap filters and ones that actually work well . I was getting such great results with my new 50mm f/1.8 lens during the day , but at night i was getting a lot of ghosting and flaring in my pictures . It took me a while to realize it was because of the filter . After doing some online research , I decided to remove the filter , and my pictures were all suddenly better with that lens . The glass was affecting my picture quality ! The glass used is cheap , and not very good quality , so it can actually degrade your pictures . It works well to protect the glass on the lens from scratches or dust , but it 's a much better idea to pay $ 20 more and get a good filter that will actually help you get better pictures . If you do n't want to pay the extra for a decent filter , you might be better off just leaving the filter off . I reccomend Hoya Pro1 and B & W ; filters ; and in the 52mm size , the price is very reasonable . Once you start buying nicer lenses that require 77mm filters , that 's where the good filters really start adding up . But again , you are n't going to want to put a cheap filter on a $ 1000 lens.I know this review might sound negative , but if it helps someone capture a memory better because they decided to get a little nicer filter , it will be worth it .	-1
ok it could happen i got the one bad filter on the rack , but unlikely . my gear lens wise was given to me by my sister really sweet stuff awesome quality , either she unloaded tons of cash on the lenses or the quality has dropped like crazy over the years.this really just a sup par product , it gets stuck on the lens hard to get off , then the build quality is just terrible.the glass seems pretty cheap , but im probably gon na have to keep it cuz it 'll probably cost more than 5 bucks to ship it back , we 'll see what they say at the post office .	-1
I 've read a ton on filters for protection of my lenses ... Do n't buy Tiffen , do n't even buy Hoya ... spend the money on B+W clear protector filters . They really do n't mess up your images . The Tiffen filters pickup everything and add nasty ghosting to your images .	-1
I bought this Tiffen 77mm UV Filter for my Canon 100-400mm IS lens . Since I got the lens I have not been getting the quality of shots I expected . Long story short , the problem was this filter . I took it off and instantly had the lens of my dreams . If you care about image quality you may want to reconsider .	-1
Again , the headline says it all . I bought this for my VIXIA HF S200 . Does not fit . Kinda bummed , ya know ?	-1
barely works as a lens protector . Do n't waste your moneyThese are NOT multi coated , I doubt they 're even single coated . I see they 're no longer advertised as multi-coated . They were when I bought them . These are plain glass , they reflect every thing a sheet of glass will.Why someone is trying to sell a warming filter in this day and age should indicate that these are old technology , aimed at film cameras . Digital cameras can correct for light sources , so this filter is for the bin . The polarizer does polarize ... ... . a bit . but not much . It does n't handle reflections well at all . The `` UV '' is plain glass - it really is a joke.The pouch is a ridiculous idea . who can keep filters clean in a pouch ? Mine were clearly used also . with scratches in the threads indicating they 'd be installed several times before . the glass was also very dirty , and was clearly handled by several people . I 'm not taking stars off for the seller incompetence , but the condition I received these in was unacceptable.A poor product , clearly returned by several others . look else where .	-1
I had a home network with my dial up internet access and when I switched to Comcast @ Home was told to go out and buy a router with a firewall . I bought the D-Link 704 in large part because I was under the impression that it integrated seamlessly with my cable service . Setting up the port and attaching it to the PCs was a snap as was getting the network to work . In about 30 minutes , I was up and running . However , the firewall built into the hardware required constant tweaking to get things like mIRC and other software programs that my son uses to work . The package comes with a quick start guide and manual but they were virtually indecipherable to me , an admitted non-techie . After a few days of trying to tweak the firewall , getting a completely unhelpful response from the tech department of D-Link and emailing with some other users who had the same problems ( based on usenet posts ) , I gave up and put everything back in the box . I ended up buying a simple port and using Live Alarm Pro as my firewall . Works like a charm . I will be selling my D-Link 704 on Amazon in a few moments if anyone wants a used one that is virtually brand new !	-1
Amazon incorrectly states the following in its writeup under features : Compatible with Canon EOS 10D , D60 , D30 , Pro90 IS , G1 , G2 , G3 and G5 modelsThis does NOT work with the G3 model . The battery has a groove at the bottom which makes it impossible to fit in the G3 battery compartment . So , if you need a lithium battery for your G3 , look elsewhere on Amazon . I noticed in the writeup from the manufacturer , below the Amazon description , it does NOT list the G3 as being compatible . I wish I had heeded that instead of Amazon 's description , which is usually very accurate.BTW I love the Canon G3 and Amazon too .	-1
i do n't know what to say about this item . when i place my order i was expecting something that work but when i got it , sorry to say this but the item is dead ... . ( no work )	-1
It only works in low light because the suns ' rays interfere with the infra-red sensor . You have to be in front of the camera and at close range.I bought this wireless-remote control and it is SOOOO much better for wildlife , micro , sunsets and fireworks or anything you want to shoot , but ca n't be touching the camera : http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KDXQLA/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1	-1

I have bought Cables to Go cables for years - excellent quality at an excellent price . I purchased three cables ( supposedly Cables to Go ) from Marginmart fullfilled by Amazon ; a 2m white USB A-B , a 3m white USB A-B , and a USB mini cable.The 2m cable is great , no complaints ( it might even be the real thing ) . I knew I had a problem as soon as I opened the 3m cable - not white , but grey . The two cables were supposedly identical , except for the length , but they look totally different , even different connectors on the ends . The wire on the 3m cable is about 1/2 the thickness of the 2m cable ( same product , longer cable = smaller cable ? I do n't think so ) . I tried hooking it up to my printer and immediately started getting printer errors.I then tried the USB mini which I bought for a backup HD . As soon as I plugged it in the HD started making beeping noises I have never heard before , then refused to mount . Hmmm ... Based on past experience with Cables to Go , the junk I received is NOT their product , but a super cheap knock-off . Beware this vendor - this is not legitimate stuff .	-1

I just bought a Spanish Program to enhance my Spanish skills , so I needed a microphone to help me out with the program.Microphone is light , weak and does n't do too much for me . I would prefer a more heavy duty mic for anything.Secondly , it does n't work at all . I understand it is typically used for online chat and what have you but my comp does n't even recognize it or hear anything when I speak to it.Obviously I 'm not too upset because I paid a measily [ ... ] bucks for it , but stay away from this mic anyway . It 's not woth the [ ... ] bucks.Overall quality is very poor as well .	-1

This device did n't work at all . Also the driver disc does n't identify which drivers are for which devices . ( IE : The phrase ST100S is not mentioned on any drivers , and there are a lot ) .Went to their website and downloaded the drivers . The folder for XP was empty . ( Even though XP is supposed to auto install this , nothing I tried worked ) . Refund was instant and I did n't have to return defective product !	-1
Most slot fans are n't `` worth a bucket of warm pi** '' This one is . I ungraded my video card to a GeForce GTX470 . That sucker puts out some serious heat and my HP Pavillion case had no room for another case fan . Enter the Antec slot fan . Its quiet ( quiet enough ) and does cool down my system.11/2011 Update : Downgraded by review . Fan grew increasingly noisy and died recently . Had to yank it out and put in a new one , same brand . Guess what ? Started making noise after two weeks . Returned it and wo n't try another .	-1
I bought this product in December 2007 and it was working great , I used it for my video card , but after six months of use , it started to make a big noise due to dust accumulation , and the rpms reduced notably . It stopped working after seven months of use . I have a vantec PCI fan in other PC , and have been working for over two years and no problems.Tried to clean this fan , but it come in a sealed case , so it is not possible . Really did not like this product . Really short lifetime .	-1

These headphones are AWFUL . Yes , the construction is excellent and they are quite comfortable considering they 're girth , but the bass is NON-EXISTENT . I tried them out right out of the box with my iPod , first with some Public Enemy and then some Guns n ' Roses . They failed both tests epically . I did n't even bother to run them through some classical or jazz , since , even at high volume ( both on the headphones themselves and my iPod/laptop ) there was an abysmal response . Do n't waste your time . I 'm returning them right after submitting this review .	-1

I got this watch for Christmas and so wanted to like it . Ultimately I returned it because of the following issues:1 . Watch is a lot bulkier than it looks from the photos . This is a big bulky watch.2 . Dark background and contrasting numbers is far from & # 34 ; easy to read & # 34 ; as stated in the description . Almost impossible to read in dimly lit environments . No way to increase the contrast . This was my biggest issue.3 . Backlight is very dim . You can not even tell it is working except in pitch black environments . Even then you have to squint to read the dial.4 . Many complicated button functions . Be prepared to spend a whole day with the manual ( which does not come with the watch ) to figure out the multiple combinations that you will never remember . It might have helped to label the buttons . As is , the labels are invisible as they are molded into the plastic and so small you need a magnifying glass and good light to even read them . A contrasting color might have helped .	-1
I bought this router about a year ago . It looks nice and sets up easily and would be a strong recommend -- if it would continue working properly.After only a few months , I started noticing the occasional internet access outage . Never even really thought about it . Then it grew progressively worse , up to 15 or 20 times a day . Not being a network guru , it 's taken quite a bit of time and effort to trace the problem back to the router . Linksys tech support did n't even answer my emails ( and phone support is now a 900 number ) .Do n't buy this product unless you hate yourself and enjoy having your internet access fail whenever you seem to need it most .	-1
I have one of these which worked very well for six months . At that point however , it failed . Be aware that if this happens to you , you will be at the mercy of Linksys 's antiquated RMA process . After spending 1/2 an hour on the phone , doing several hard resets , the very nice woman informed me that my modem had & quot ; gone bad & quot ; and that the process of getting an RMA number sent to me via email would take 2-3 days . She then informed me that I should fill out the emailed RMA form and return it with the defective device . She said I should expect to receive a new device 7-10 business days later.I cringe at telling my spouse and kids that cable modem access will be out for the remainder of the month.All told , they appear to have a well designed product that was fairly easy to get running . But I find their response to a clear product failure six month 's after purchase to be woefully inadequate . My recommendation would be to find another product .	-1
I got this router two years ago and used it to share my DSL connection among my computers . Setting it up was very easy . I did get disconnected once or twice a week , but I never investigated if it was the router or my DSL provider who dropped the connection . Now it 's been two years and the dreaded Diag light went solid red the other day . I contacted Linksys tech support through on-line chat from their web site and got a quick response . Unfortunatly they told me the router is broken and there is nothing they can do . Easy installation , low price , good tech support , but possibly dropped connections and limited lifespan -- that comes out at two stars in my book .	-1
I bought mine at a local Micro Center . I wish I 'd looked here first . The Linksys was easy to set up and would probably work fine for 99 percent of people . I also like the fact that this is not an 802.11b base station . I prefer to have the security option of unplugging the wireless base station and therefore it needs to be a separate physical box.What about those 1 percent of users who wo n't like this product ? If you like to keep TCP connections open for a long time , e.g. , if you 're a developer using ssh or telnet , this Linksys is problematic . My old SMC router , after upgrading the firmware , was rock solid and I could keep an Emacs up and running on a remote server for days or weeks . With the Linksys connections will mysteriously die . I have n't changed my cable modem or my cable service .	-1
Do NOT buy this router . It continually looses it 's connection to the internet . If you take the time to peruse the chat rooms at Linksys you will find that this is a know issue with this unit and there is no solution .	-1
I installed two of these cards on my Mom and Dad 's laptops . One , a Compaq Presario running Windows ME , became completely hosed after the install software destroyed the registry . I 'm going to have to reinstall the whole machine.The other , a Dell Latitude running Windows 2000 Pro , goes into an endless reboot loop if the card is plugged in . Both the HW and SW are junk in my opinion .	-1
Do not buy this camera ! The batteries die in less that one set of 36 pictures . The quality is poor even on the highest setting . Do n't compare megapixels , there is a difference in image quality between cameras of the same resolution . The flash takes almost a minute to charge sometimes . And it shuts off after taking a picture . mine is a combination of defects and poor design . It 's going back . I made the mistake of thinking I could get a digital camera for $ 200 . You have to spend $ 500 to get a decent one which is just too much for the mass market right now .	-1
Buying these are like buying a cheap bike . They 'll probably stay in your drawer and quash any interest you have in either viewing celestial or terrestrial ( or in some cases , telestial ) objects . In short , these binocs will probably last at least a lifetime because they 're so poor in rendering a respectable image . Seriously , buy a NIKON . You wo n't regret it . Also , if the people who gave these binocs a good review knew what they were buying , they would n't be buying entry level Bushnell binocs.There are so many things going on when binoculars are focusing an image , things like chromatic aberration . Colors focus at slightly different points and a good lens has to bring them all together into one crisp image . The best way to see what I 'm talking about is by picking up a pair of these binocs and then comparing them directly with a decent pair . Now please realize , even NIKON is n't considered GREAT , just decent . To get GREAT optics , plan on spending six or seven hundred clams , and more than a grand for super-photo quality optics . But , as with bicycles and everything else , there is usually a point of diminishing marginal return somewhere along the way . The basic rule of thumb is to NOT TO BUY CHEAP . If your binocs have Busruby-coated lenses , run , do n't walk away from them ! ( These Bushnells are n't that bad , but your eyes deserve crisp , contrasty images , and with these binocs , you 'll find yourself first focusing and then refocusing , vainly trying to find that sweet spot of clarity that never comes . ) So what are you doing still reading this ? Point your mouse to a NIKON or try to find a pair of these used . You should be able to find them cheap .	-1
These binoculars are n't the quality that Bushnell claims.I ca n't get them to focus clearly.Not very happy with this purchase	-1
One reason to buy circumnaural ( around the ear ) headphones is to reduce environmental sound.These headphones block nothing at all ... .nothing . I can hear the environment just as easily as if they were not on.Otherwise , adequate for the price ... nothing special .	-1
I have had lots of problems with this card , and I have still not gotten it to work . I have an IBM Thinkpad , a Sony Vaio , and a Powerbook G4 . This card doesnt work in *any* of them . I have followed the instructions very carefully.An important note here : The Windows 95 instructions are downright *wrong* and make no allowances for differences in system configuration ( for example insisting that the CD-ROM be D : , as opposed to E : ) . There is _no_ installer on the CD , and Windows was n't able to find any drivers on the disk.Linux is another story . The card does not seem to power up correctly , so the Linux kernel module cant seem to talk to it . This is probably due to the poor fit of the card in all three of my laptops . I 'll get into that in a moment.In MacOS , the card powered up ( the Powerbook has a very slick PCMCIA dock , so that doesnt surprise me at all ) . However , there are a ) no drivers and b ) it doesnt even attempt to identify itself as 99 % of the other PCMCIA cards out there do.In general , this card has been bad news , and I 'm not sure what to make of it , other than chalking it up to $ 100 down the drain.A further issue , which really prevents me from ever wanting to buy Linksys hardware in the future , is that the card just doesnt & quot ; fit & quot ; right into the VAIO or the Thinkpad ( both very mainstream , expensive laptops ) . It is necessary to push the card in so hard it feels like the antenna may break off . This is a horrible way to manufacture a product.Lastly , and mostly least , is the fact that the card comes with no case whatsoever . Because it has this huge antenna sticking out the side , it could be easily broken by leaving it in the laptop when moving the laptop around ( which you do with every other card , right ? ) . Your only choice is to continue to use the static baggie that comes with it or improvise something.Overall , the implementation and conception of this product is poor at best , and I will never buy another Linksys product again . Its a miss in three different operating systems on three different laptops .	-1
A new version of the card is on the shelves now ( version 2.5 ) that has more problems than any previous version I have played with . I am a network engineer and I have had previous experience with 802.11b gear in the past.The documentation that comes with this card is incomplete . I can not get the device to send data to either of my BEFW11S4 routers , although it shows that the link is valid . No setting change would make this better.Forget about linux support for the v2.5 card . I ca n't get windows to work with the card , and linux seems to have a problem with the CIS . Maybe it will change sometime , but what I get from the linux wireless development groups is that no plans are in place to make this card work . The previous versions do work.I have had this card for over a month , and have yet to get a live body on the phone , or a response from linksys via email , regardless of the number of requests I have made for simple answers to questions such as : & quot ; What configuration must my LINKSYS befw11s4 and WPC11 card have for the two to communicate ? & quot ; amoungst others.My suggestion : Do n't buy anything linksys . If you do , pray that it works as intended , and out of the box . It does n't matter if you do it for a living , or if you have experience with the type of gear you are buying . Go with another vendor .	-1
I like my Linksys equipment . But in my cinder block Hawaiian house , the wireless hub is on one end , and not more than 40 feet away , I ca n't reach the dining room table or the kitchen , where I prefer to watch movies stored on my Linux machine.I even got past the problems with the XP install and it works like a charm sitting right by the hub.This card needs some more boost ... ..	-1
I bought this card together with a LinkSys wireless access point to replace an older D-Link combination . Tried to install it on my laptop under Windows XP . The bottom line ? After 16 hours of trying , multiple visits to the LinkSys website , multiple converasations with their tech support , installing new drivers , installing new firmware , attempting to reinstall it more than 10 times , I gave up . Reinstalled my old stuff and sent this thing back . The most aggravating part was tech support . All I got was & quot ; you need new drivers & quot ; even though the stuff was BRAND NEW . The install procedure in the manual is wrong ( according to tech support ) . How can they sell stuff like this ?	-1
These were the headphones I longed for for more than 10 years . I felt connected to Koss so I was `` electro '' estatic when it arrived . But this soon turned into agony when I found out the front part of the amp had scratches all over on the front face and two careless razor nicks where the amp had cut outs for switches etc . ( Note I ordered these phones direct from the factory after what I suspect were used ones I had been receiving elsewhere despite being advertised as `` new '' ) . These were brand new and the leather bag had a pleasant leather smell that permeated for days in my room and the black box it came in was not creased all over like others I had received . The previous ESP ( s ) were not like this.Calling Koss was a great shock . The customer service lady kept referring to the scratches sarcastically as smudges and basically refuted what I was saying , even though I had the evidence right in my hand ! I could not wipe it off with anything , including with mild solution . I thought being their most expensive audiophile product I would get better service from Koss , but no , you are treated like you are trying to rip them off ! The scratches could easily be seen when light was angled on it . I decided to return it to their famous lifetime warranty service and hoped they would just give me another brand new one . In fact , I offered them to just send me a faceplate and I would replace it myself , as the ESP seemed to be brand new I did n't want to let go of it based on my previous experiences , but they said no . I began to have a bad feeling about this and reluctantly packed it up and sent it back.I sent the entire unit back per their instructions and received an amp that had no scratches on it back but minus the factory plastic protective bag and the manual that was sent with it ! ! ! The worst part was the right earpad ( I can not tell if it was the original or not ) began to make a static sound ! I decided at paying so much for the ESP that this should not happen and the cost of returning and sending them back was getting too prohibitive . It cost me a total of $ 80 bucks , and to take another chance at their `` crack '' lifetime warranty repair staff was something I was not going to do twice . Maybe this time they will make it perfect and the left earpad will start making a static sound to match the right and there goes another $ 40 plus a another lifetime warranty repair fee added ! Well they say the 3rd time is the charm . Probably the Koss repair department has that engraved on their front wall.To my surprise I received my refund minus the free shipping cost they offered ! I complained to Koss to refund my entire cost as the ESP was defective on their part and their famed lifetime warranty service made it worse , from defective to unusable . They refunded my total cost only after I threatened them to take it up the `` chain '' .Quality control or reliability is another issue as I found out some supposedly new ESP phones sound different from each other ( especially in the bass area ) or have cosmetic flaws , gold rusting on the logos or the earpads are mismatched in the cushioning areas . The inside of the amp seemed ill connected to the circuit board with connectors and the small bulb light not really lining up correctly , but it still was somewhat solid . Surprisingly the volume/balance knob worked fine and seemed accurate and firm . I am only complaining because at this price could n't they take the time to make sure at least it looked correct ? Conclusion : after thinking about this for awhile I decided these headphones may be too fragile and not worth my cost to own again and may weigh heavily against a future decision . I might have changed my mind had they just replaced it with new one pulled from the rack or maybe if the lifetime warranty service had done a careful `` audiophile '' job on it . ( I am particular at this price range ) . It 's also apparent to me that maybe their famed lifetime warranty service is not all `` cracked up '' to what it should be and I hate to think if I ever owned one and it needed repair that it is being repaired by people who do n't care for their product or have been working there too long ( maybe a lifetime ) and have only daily contempt for it.Currently looking for a new audiophile headphone to replace these . Though I doubt I can find an electrostatic one in this price range . It was an excellent value . Too bad ! I have not commented on the sound since it is an already `` proven '' electrostatic . But if it is something that is not reliable and the service behind it is the same , this puts it in a `` useless '' category that is not even worth commenting about its purpose.PROS : Excellent Value ( when it works ) Includes everything to play or connect with.It 's portable.Comes with a quality real leather carry-all bag.Lifetime Warranty Service ( in name only ) Longtime manufacturing record of ESP with no changes to model.It is comparable or better to the Stax headphones.CONS : Lifetime Warranty Service ( You 'll go broke using this unreliable service . See below ) .Shipping cost plus Koss repair fee can be prohibitive and a deal breaker if not fixed correctly the first time.Poor 2nd tier customer care ( less ) service both via their no response e-mail service and phone.Manual is just a single semi-gloss fold out paper ( no color ) , no wonder they trashed it ! Comes unsealed in an ill-fitting box.Some quality control issues.COMMON PROBLEMS : Rust on the Gold Logos.Headband can be hard to attach to earphones.CONCLUSION : Buy these headphones only from the factory . You pay a lot more but it will be guaranteed brand new . I would recommend these headphones only to those that just want extreme low distortion and a very flat response up and down the bandwidth and understand how this applies to the music you will listen to and do n't mind an unreliable repair department for a lifetime .	-1
bought this one for $ 15 . After 10 minutes of use , the smoothness of the trackball was gone ; made it useless . Threw away in trash next day . Do n't buy it .	-1
Microsoft should really take a lesson from Logitech here . I tried the Trackball Explorer as a replacement for my WELL worn Logitech Marble-Man FX ( discontinued - though I 'll never understand why . ) My hands are M/L - totally typical.After 1 hour of use , my thumb was killing me . You see , you must reach BACK to far to hit the thumb button . If you compare it to logitech , you 'll see that they have the buttons in-line with the ball or just under where your thumb falls naturally , meaning you can click on them without bending your thumb at all.The mouse is accurate , and the ball feels nice , but you have to use those buttons ... and they are awful . If they 'd move them forward about 1 '' this would work as well as the Logitech MarbleMan FX does.It 's no wonder those things are going for $ 150 USED on Ebay ... Logitech had it right and nobody has yet repeated it .	-1
The WDT11 will work if you buy the WPC11 version 1 . The problem is , no one sells the WPC11 version 1 . The current version of WPC11 is version 3 , and Linksys customer service told me that version 3 does n't work with the WDT11 ( it works fine in a laptop ) . Linksys customer service recommended the newer WMP11 card which is made for desktops . This WDT11 is an adapter to get the laptop peripheral WPC11 to work in a desktop .	-1
I agree this is a solid cookware . But it is so hot on the handles everytime I try to remove it from the stove . I believe they can do something about the design of the handles . BTW , my hands are not so sensitive to heat normally . But this is super hot beyond my tolerance .	-1
I bought the eTrex Legend three years ago to replace an older model that I passed on to my son . The price was right and it came with Garmen 's software , a car lighter power cable and a protective case . A big improvement was the ability to run the unit off of the car 's DC power while driving toward the final location and then run off of battery while on foot . However , I did notice that it seemed to be less capable of getting a good signal and would frequently bounce all over the place in the woods . Now it has a propensity to lock up after a few minutes of usage . I 've read from earlier postings that this has something to do with outdated WAAS protocols . Clearly if this is not something that Garmen has fixed in the firmware , the product will be useless . I found that the only way to unlock the unit was to remove the battery cover and pull out a battery and replace it . Sometimes the `` reboot '' and reacquire process takes a longer period of time than the unit will function before locking up again . I am now looking for another replacement , hopefully one that will make it easier to go paperless .	-1
It 's very simple , everything I have ever owned by SimpleTech has died on me including this SD Card , 4 USB sticks , 1 Hard DRive , and 1 CF card . Not one of their products lasted me more than 2 years and caused me a lot of headache .	-1

I work in the computer section of a mid-sized printing company , and I also do a lot of web work on the side , so I see a lot of different , and at some points odd ) ways to store media.I bought my external 250 drive a few months ago , along with 9 disks to go with it ... all of which ( drive and disks ) are sitting on a shelf collecting dust.This drive does not work well personally , or professionally , whether you want to reuse it a million times , or store important back-ups . The disks are not dependable enough to rely upon to keep long term back-ups , constant use corrupts the disks , and forget about sending them through the mail ! No matter how careful you are in packaging them , chances are you 'll get a few back with messages saying & quot ; I ca n't open most of the files , they 've gone bad & quot ; .Buy a CD writer , test your CDs before you give them to someone else , and you wo n't have any problems , mail them ... step on them ... pour some soda on them ... as long as you do n't play hockey with them , or melt them , you 'll be OK .	-1
OK , what do you do when you need a PDA and you do n't have a lot of cash ? You buy this completely forgettable Palm device , use it as a stop-gap measure until you can afford a decent Pocket PC or Linux based PDA . Palm has pefected the calendar and address book features of their handhelds ( they thought them up and have the most practice after all ) , but the lack of versatility and connectivity with other windows programs makes this Palm a sorry purchase .	-1
This item was such a HUGE disappointment . Initially , it worked well . BUT the more it was used ( we are only talking 50 rolls or so ) the more it started to deteriorate . First came the noises . Then the grinding . Then the failures to load film . Forget trying to load the rolls of 40 pictures , it would bring this thing to a grinding halt in many cases . This thing was only built to scan maybe 25-50 rolls tops . Read the reviews on other websites . Others have had the same thing happen . Inevitable failure . AND this is my SECOND one , both with the same result . For Nikon to release such a poorly constructed product is surprising . Especially since the scanner ( I have the Coolscan V ) it goes in is actually a well built and excellent product.Bottom line ... WAY too much money for a hunk of plastic with such poor construction . It will do the job if it is a small one ( 25-to 50 rolls , keep the number of rolls of 40 pictures to a minimum ! ) . Be prepared to use that warranty and send it back to Nikon at least once or twice . And wear a headset , becuase that grinding squeaking noise as it rolls your film out is unbearable !	-1
After a lot of research I bought this unit rather than others from well known electronics brands , with a lot of trust and excitement . Mi RioVolt worked fine for a short while then started showing problems reading burnt CDs it used to play fine . I upgraded the Firmware to latest verion 2.10 and the probles worsened . After many hours of testing all conceivable settings and brand media wasted , ( both CD-R and CD-RW ) I contacted Tech support to get an answer that my unit was fine ( how can they tell ? ) and the problem was with the burner . Many hours and tests with burners later , my Rio does not work at all and am waiting for a reply from Rio .	-1
If you really need an *MP3* boombox , this seems to be the best of the bunch : it plays MP3s well . The sound quality , though , is very poor compared to comparably-priced boomboxes ( with regular CDs ) : annoyingly bright , hard , and distorted highs that make it unpleasant to listen to for long . The AM and FM reception is poor . There 's no tone controls , no anti-skip protection , no way to power it in a car , and no audio out or headphone jacks for other speakers or dubbing.In short , you 're trading off features and sound quality for MP3 playback . Without MP3 playback , this is a very attractive ... boombox.I bought this to provide background music for my massage therapy practice . On synthesized music without vocals , the sound is tolerable , and the ability to put 10 hours of music is very nice indeed . But I regret buying it .	-1
Would be nice if it worked . Tried everything my Pentax K-x manual indicated that I should do and still no action . Not impressed . Perhaps a two pound mason 's hammer would do the trick .	-1
This card worked fine for a while , a couple of months , in my Minolta Dimage 7 . Then , for no apparent reason , it would hold only a few more images than a SanDisk 64 MB card I have .	-1
