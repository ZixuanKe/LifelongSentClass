I had been researching bulbs to increase my vision at night on my cruiser motorcycle . After much hunting and reading reviews , etc , I decided on these . I put one into my headlamp , and WOW ! ! ! What a difference ! ! ! I love the results . I will carry the other bulb in the bike 's toolbox for a spare , just in case .	1
Purchased the bulbs to replace some dim bulbs with nearly 100k miles on them . The packaging for these is very protective but was a hassle to remove the bulbs from . Easy to install , fit perfectly on my vehicle . Definitely brighter , but I was replacing original factory bulbs so I ca n't really say whether they are brighter than new factory installed ones . I ca n't comment on the life , but for the price I would definitely purchase again provided they last a decent amount of time .	1
These light do make a difference for a 2012 Jeep Wrangler , stock light were not bright at all , I estimate that there is at least a 50 % increase in brightness . Well worth the expense for the upgrade !	1
This plugged right in and worked as advertised . The packaging when I received mine had & # 34 ; 9008 xps2 & # 34 ; vs & # 34 ; 9008 H13 & # 34 ; as shown in the circle , so do n't worry if that happens to you . The end result was a very much more white light vs the factory yellow/orange . The distance it goes out is about the same as the factory . The fill out to the sides and near the front of the Jeep is better . It 's not holy crap better , but a bit better . Now I do n't feel the need to run my fog lights all the time . I think the brights are no better than the low beams on these really . I got mine with a rebate for about $ 20 . In theory because they are burning brighter they will burn out faster.TIPSDo n't touch the bulb when installing .	1
Maybe I 'm biased because the Toyota FJ Cruiser seems to come with the most anemic headlights ever made ... but these Philips were a marked increase in brightness for me . I 'm very satisfied .	1
Still have not blown out on me as other people keep saying . I ca n't help but wonder if they know not to touch the bulb itself . It can be difficult to see improvement in a headlight on any regular night but I have found on wet and rainy nights these bulbs make a huge difference .	1
I have a 2001 prius c dim lights . I used a cleaner on the plastic and it was brighter . I tried these headlights cause of the ratings . I put only one in for now and was trying to compare in the dark . the package says its 80 % brighter , I dont think so . More like 25 % brighter and a little wider . I really want to know how long these will last , some have said one year , I hope so . Ive had them for a couple of months and they are better than the old ones , the price was not bad on amazon too !	1
No complaints . I previously had the Sylvania 's in there and I do n't know if it 's because they lost power over time but I do n't have the issue of low light on those dark stormy nights .	1
I had some other bulbs in the car before that I thought was pretty bright but then I tried these based on reviews and price , and all I have to say is that I am amazed at the distance these light bulbs project to ! I feel much safer driving at night because I can see a lot further and the angle is much wider . So worth the money !	1
**UPDATE I recently installed a set of these on a 2002 Subaru Forester . They are much brighter than OEM and other replacement bulbs as my previous review states on the other vehicles I have used these with . HOWEVER the DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS NO LONGER FUNCTION by automatically turning on the low beam headlights when the car is turned on . To me this is not a problem , if one wants to drive during the day with their headlights on they can do so by simply turning them on manually . Just note that this may occur if you car is equipped with daytime running lamps . Personally I prefer them as is and like the complete control of when my headlights are on or off and think exchanging FAR brighter bulbs for them being on automatically during the day is more than worth it , and again the price here on Amazon was much cheaper than in the stores , still think these are the best halogen bulb replacement deal out there . Fast and easy way to make your headlights brighter . **Yes these bulbs are about as good as you are going to get with your stock headlights , they have a noticeable improvement in brightness over the stock bulbs , but do n't expect too much . These bulbs have made the biggest improvement over stock among the various similar bulbs of which I have tried . I like them a bit better than the Silver Stars for example . The price here was very good and they basically did about what they were advertised to do . I would recommend them . However these or any other bulbs may not be enough if you have other issues such as the clouded headlight lenses . These are good halogen bulb replacements , they will be brighter than stock but not without clear lenses and not turn them in to HID brightness levels . If you have old clouded lenses as well then using a headlight restoration kit will help a lot as well . I used these bulbs along with one of the Maguires headlight restoration kit with the Plastic X compound . My mothers 98 Toyota Camry had very weak headlights and I noticed the clouded lenses and purchased these bulbs to try to give her the best vision for night driving I could . Especially important if one does not have the best night vision to begin with . So that gave her clear lenses again which was needed for any new bulb to work better . This is about as good as one is going to get with a halogen bulb upgrade from all of those I have tried to date and they are very easy to install . So a good improvement for the money as they are easy to change and inexpensive.It is easy to see the difference in brightness with these bulbs . Just change one out and turn your headlight on shining on your garage door for example . It should be obvious they are both brighter and whiter . The easiest and cheapest way to make your stock headlights brighter . While I keep the bulbs I have replaced in the vehicle just in case one is needed in an emergency I have yet to have one of these bulbs burn out prematurely . I have had them in one vehicle for 2 years and still working . For about 25 bucks they are both a good deal and better than found at the local parts stores.If they are not bright enough for you just do not make the mistake of going to a plug and play type HID kit ... See Below about that.The only real way to get an incredible improvement ( 3-4 times brighter ) from your stock headlight housings is to do a PROPER HID retrofit . But as for HID I want to make it clear that they are great and will be about 3- 4 times brighter than stock for sure and use less wattage as almost all run at 35 watts . BEWARE if you are going to go with HID 's one should NOT buy an inexpensive `` Plug and Play '' kit that uses ballasts and HID bulbs that you stick in your stock halogen headlight housing . Doing so will cause the huge increase in brightness with no control of the beam pattern and while also illegal almost everywhere more importantly they will blind oncoming traffic and are a hazard will likely burn your reflectors in your headlight housings and are just a horrible thing to do period , no exceptions . HOWEVER there is a CORRECT way to upgrade to HID headlights which is known as `` retrofitting '' which means that you install projectors designed for HID bulbs . This is a great improvement and they have cutoff shields built in to the projectors so there is a very controlled but wide and bright low beam and super good high beam output . Doing this requires opening up the actual headlight housing and installing the new projectors and mounting the ballasts and new wiring harness . There is a place that sells these sort of kits for retrofitting and web sites dedicated to this subject . It is far from just plugging in a new bulb such as this so it takes a bit of effort or paying a shop that does HID retrofits to do this for you . Just a warning to those that think the cheap HID kits everywhere are not an option to even consider . Get the best halogen bulbs you can find or do a full HID retrofit . Do n't make the mistake that just using a HID plug and play kit such as is commonly sold here and other places is a `` middle of the road option '' . It is most likely illegal and never a good idea no matter how enticing the cheap prices seem.Use these halogen upgrade bulbs and if that is not enough for you then go all the way . There are just way too many that go for these plug and play kits that are illegal and cause accidents that I want the message out that they should not be considered which many that are looking for brighter headlights such as those purchasing these bulbs could potentially consider . If interested in HID try a web site forum like the HID planet for advice .	1
Nice white light , a little brighter than a `` regular '' bulb . It helps me spot El Chupacabra that has been spotted in the area recently and a nice unpromoted feature of these lights is the color balance of these lights are specifically made to fend off vampires . I had the chance to try it out the other night on my way home from my competitive bread making club and they worked great .	1
After doing alot of research on aftermarket light bulbs for my late-model vehicles , I decided to go with these . And i 'm glad I did ! ! ! First of all , I think the wavelength of the Silverstar lights is inefficient and obnoxious to say the least . I 've utilized silverstars in the past with less than pleasant results , often hindering my driving ability in everything but clear weather . This is not the case with the Philips bulbs tho . While I was n't blown away by the brightness of these lamps ( as other reviewers have noted ) , the lights pattern is MUCH more effective than stock lamps . These bulbs also retain the OEM yellow/incandescent color , thus matching any stock fog light bulbs you might have on your vehicle . This simple fact keeps the vehicle appearance clean as opposed to having different color/intensity sets of bulbs . Good stuff ...	1
Nice bright white light . I hope they last more than one year , but let 's see what happens . Consumer reports say these brighter halogens are basically just whiter lights , not much brighter anyway . But I got it for 20 bucks if my rebate check ever comes in . But you can buy regular phillps for 12 bucks a pair and they will last at least a few years , but I personally like the whiter light .	1
I noticed the extra field of vision from these bulbs . I used them in my Subaru replacing both bulbs as one was out , they were GE bulbs . They are brighter then the old bulbs .	1
I purchased these love-beam headlight bulbs to replace the stock bulbs in my 2003 Toyota 4Runner ; per the Amazon parts tool . I 'd never replaced the bulbs myself , but after a quick 'how to ' on Google , I easily replaced the bulbs myself and was pleased with the illumination they provided.The light is visibly whiter than the stock bulbs they replaced , and seem about 30 % brighter with good coverage to the sides as well as the front of the vehicle.The claim by Philips that these bulbs provide 'up to ' 50 % more width and 50 ' longer beam is debatable , but I would imagine that depends a lot on your driving conditions , age of your vehicle , type of vehicle and similar.A single OEM bulb was about six dollars , so for a little bit more per bulb I believe I installed a much better product . I 'm pleased with my purchase and would recommend these bulbs to others who are looking for brighter , whiter low-beam headlights at the right price .	1
For some reason all of the bulbs in my VW Golf , not just the headlights , seem to burn out frequently . I 've gone through about 7 pair of headlight bulbs in 10 years . I 've tried expensive ones , long life ones , and many others . None seemed to last any longer than the others and even light output seemed to be the same . The last set I bought were these and so far they seem to have lasted longer than the rest , including the OEM bulbs . I bought this set to keep in the car for when the other do go out , which I 'm sure they will . These are not supper premium , high output , magic bulbs , and therefore are reasonably priced . Even though they are not the newest wiz bang bulbs they seem to me to put out the same light as any other bulb yet also seem to hold up better .	1
So far so good . I hope these last longer than some of the other reviews I had read on them.My vehicle is white , and these lights are whiter than the ones I had in them before . I enjoy the look and the clearness of them . I do not think they go 50 ' further though & # 8230 ; The price is the same as if you purchased it from the local store ( in my case ) . The shipping was really fast , I am pleased with the purchase .	1
Definitely brighter than stock bulbs . Have been using them for 2-3 months now and no issues . They do illuminate the road a little further .	1
The quality and performance of these bulbs can not be equaled by any other $ 18 pair of lights I have used yet . After a couple of trips , and more extensive night driving in my 1997 F-150 , I can , with all confidence , say these are the best lights I have ever used . Properly adjusted , in my truck these lights easily reach out another 50 feet on the pavement , as advertised . The distance may be a little further , as is the 50 % wider spread . The street signs on the side of the road and at the end of the street are easy to see again and I have actually been driving when , more than once , people in my truck asked if my high beams were on . Driving in my neighborhood at night , I have not been flashed , yet . When I turn on my high beams I can see even more difference . If they failed today , I might still give them a positive review , with my 59 year old eyes saying oh thank you . I do n't know for sure if Philips is going to discontinue the Vision Plus line as I have heard , but if they do it 's a shame . I will buy a couple more sets , just in case . Amazon is still the best place to find deals on these lights .	1
These bulbs are noticeably brighter than the OEM bulbs ( this is compared to 3 year old bulbs ) . They definitely put off more white light , and have more light at the edges of the cone than OEM bulbs .	1
Purchased these for my '12 Jetta and I must say there is a noticable difference compared to the stock bulb . The OEM bulb was a dull yellow and shined maybe 25 ' infront of the vehicle . Once the new bulbs were installed I immediately noticed a change in light output . First , the beam is a shade whiter than a stock bulb . It 's also brighter and shines a great distance further than the original . Granted , the headlight assembly plays a major factor on how well the bulb performs but considering both Philips and VW are German engineered they seem to work well with eachother . Definitely a great purchase especially for the price !	1
Like the title says , the package looks nice , but is difficult to open without touching the glass of the bulbs . Keeping the bulbs clean prior to installation is a big factor in a long lifespan ( skin oils will burn off , causing localized hotspots and possible cracks , as I understand it ) .The bulbs are nice , definitely whiter than the old stock bulbs I had , and the price is right .	1
Bulbs appear to be of high quality but i ca n't honestly say they improve visibility by the amount claimed on the packaging ... it appears the same as OEM.Still good bulbs though	1
These are the best and brightest bulbs for the $ $ that I have tried , out of 3 other types . Great and long lasting .	1
The cost of these bulbs on amazon is way cheaper than the parts store by a lot . These are clearly brighter than my originals but I do n't expect them to last as long since they probably run hotter . One trick , turn on your daytime running lamps , gimmick to make you buy more .	1
These are ordinary , run of the mill H7 headlight bulbs . They do what they are supposed to do and they fit the sockets fine - like they should . I can not confirm that the beams are any wider or longer than they used to be with any other bulbs that I 've tried , but maybe I 've been using bulbs that also emit `` 50 % wider and 30 % longer '' beams - I do n't know ; I can only report that the illumination is appropriate but not extraordinary.The bulbs are priced a quite a bit under the Sylvania Silverstars that have a slight blue tint on the glass and appear to be a little whiter but emit more or less the same amount of light.For some reason Amazon believes that these bulbs do n't fit my 2004 Mazda 3 ; but an H7 bulb is an H7 bulb , and every H7 bulb is designed to fit an H7 socket , and these bulbs indeed fit my car 's sockets well , and they do n't overheat , and they are OK.It is always beneficial to put small amount of dielectric grease on the contacts before installing a bulb , so do your car a small favor .	1
Easy to install . Be careful that you are buying low beam for your headlights ( which these are ) and not low beam for fog lights . Philips Amazon configuration guide indicated my car would use the 9006 as low beam when I also bought 9005 as high beam . Well , that 's correct if I wanted to put in new fog lights . The actual low beam bulbs are these H11 's and they are brighter ! 9006 's went back to their happy home at the Amazon warehouse . Note , I saved the old bulbs and put them in the new packaging just in case I have a burnout and need a quick replacement . You never know .	1
This product is good for your car which I recommend to get when your lights blow out and need another bulb .	1
So this stinkin little saab 95 I 'm working on looked like it has xenon head lights , but after opening it , it 's a standard halogen bulb ! ! Seller said it would fit this make and model , make sure you actually take the bulb out and inspect it and the numbers that are on it ! Overall nothing wrong with the bulb I was sent , it just was not the right one for this application ... ..product and shipping was great ! !	1
This thing is actually same as the original one from Dealer . Dealer gon na charged $ 150 for the lightbulb and another $ 200 for installation . I bought 2 of it because many people told me the light will look difference after awhile ( color may look vary ) . After i installed and i think it looks ok for me and i just keep another one in the trunk just in case . It is not easy to take out the old one but is little bit tricky to put back the new one . Anyway , it took awhile to do it in 1st time ... but after you know it , it should be done less than 15 mins	1
Excellent ! ! ! The price is right and the temp is as well . I compared the numbers off of stock with these and they are the same ! Whew ! OEM all around , same maker and color temp ! Look at the savings over the steaer , you cant beat Amazon ! i buy everything off of Amazon because i save $ $ $	1
Do n't hesitate with these , they are the same as the OEM manufacturers use . They are also so much brighter than aftermarket D2S bulbs due to the quality of the glass/salts/other components .	1
The price is decent and the quality is the same as OEM . Slightly yellow and they get whiter as they age . The difference between the new and old bulb is amazing . I did n't realize how much HID bulbs degrade over time . Highly Recommended .	1
USE the AMAZON fit guide as this will not work in my 14 WRX . It is my fault not Phillips as I did not use the fit guide and just went on the fact that a 9005 bulb will work in my car but THIS 9005 bulb only works in one direction or you get the yellow on the wrong side . Truly I hate this will not work as I can tell this is such a well made product so if it will fit in your car ... Go for it !	1
I 've had these in my car for a bit over a year and have been very impressed so far.I 'm surprised by the short bulb life reviews , and I 'm not doubting those , but ~15 months along and mine are still burning bright.I have them installed in a 1987 BMW 325is that have new Hella housings from a '91 325i . The low beams have very good light output and even color . They do not have the fake-HID blue look and the three color design does seem to work well.The high beams are incredibly effective , especially considering that these are a stock wattage bulb.A note on the amount of light that stock wattage aftermarket bulbs put out ; they are all going to put out the same amount of light . Most of the wattage claims ( 100 watts of light from 60 watts ! ) are crazy marketing lies.Highs - good light output , even light pattern , no fake-blue color.Lows - hard to find , not available in some sizes .	1
Much brighter than standard bulbs and the Philips Crystal Vision , which is more white than anything else . I really like the tribeam effect too .	1
Having been unimpressed with Silverstars and some of the `` blue lights '' on the market , I decided to give these a try.I have been very pleased with the performance of these units . Unlike lesser products , they do not color coat the bulbs in a way that diminishes lighting just to achieve a color shift . Instead , they have what look like little reflectors inside to send blue / yellow to the sides.Where I really noticed the difference was in how they really make the side of the road look much crisper . The other big plus , especially versus the silverstars , is in rain or fog where they really do excel.While these will not turn your old headlights into HID 's , they are a good upgrade and probably the best replacement option out there . Sure , you could go with something higher wattage but that risks melting components or wires , or even creating an electrical fire .	1
The right half of the bulb is like a neon ( highlighter ) yellow color and the other side has a mild hint of blue . Overall the effect is nice and seeing at night is great . I used these to replace my silver stars and I have to say these look neat and seem to project as well . This has dual 55w filaments which is perfect for my car which uses 1 bulb for high beams , low beams , and running lights.Packaging was very sturdy and bulbs arrived save and well protected .	1
I purchased these for a co-worker who need bulbs for his truck . He did n't give me any complaints so I assumed he was happy with them .	1
Strong pressure when pump washer fluidEasy to install and good instructions how to wire to existing wiring from your vehicleGood to replace original windshield washer or make it universal windshield washer for your car if you have room under hood	1
I replaced the old windshiled washer bag on my 72 AMC Javelin with this unit and it works perfectly . I 'm thrilled since the bag has n't held fluid for the better part of 2 decades .	1
I bought this for my 98 Jeep Cherokee . It has a snorkel installed so the washer pump needed to be moved . Well this kit has every part you could imagine for a full installation from the switch to the tubing to the jets/nozzles . I was very impressed with all that it came with . It holds a little more than a quart . For $ 13 , I am 100 % satisfied and will buy more if the need arises .	1
I got one a while back for the motorhome , and it works great . I got another one for my Nissan 4x4 , and am glad I did . You ca n't go wrong with this unit .	1
Dont expect this to hold a full bottle of washer fluid ! I 'm using it as an Intercooler Sprayer & It 's perfect for what I need it for , very easy to mount anywhere you like .	1
This is the one to get if you are replacing the waterpump . I used for a 2005 chevy suburban 5.3 liter . The original had 114,000 miles and was still good but i decided to replace it and all hoses for reliabilty . This pump looks like it is well made and includes the thermostat bolts and gaskets . This needs a new design thermostat and is different than the original , it costs around 30 bucks and includes housing and thermostat . GM makes another one which is cheaper but i read some reviews that the quality isnt there on that pump .	1
The water pump is very high quality and fit perfectly on my 2003 Chevy Tahoe 5.3L . The new pump came with two new thermostat bolts and high quality gaskets . The manual said to torque the bolts to 22 foot pounds and I also used medium strength blue lock tight . My original pump lasted 10 years and 110K so that 's why I 'm sticking with a new GM part . Update 5/6/13 The first pump failed it had a leak at the top metal pipe where it connects to the pump . After calling Amazon and speaking to several people then a manager I got the pump warrantied . Amazon can be tricky with auto part sales because of there 30 day money back guaranty even when the manufacture warranties the item for a year . This may be a problem for me buying auto parts from Amazon again .	1
This is the exact part that was on my vehicle and has lasted 10 years so I chose to replace the original with this one . Kit comes with set of 2 gaskets ( you should still use some RTV silicone water pump material on each side of the gasket to prevent gaskets from moving and leaking during installation . There are also 2 bolts where the inlet for lower radiator hose containing thermostat gets bolted . It is advised to purchase a new inlet with thermostat and to ( check me on this ) a new fan clutch when installing a new water pump . I also decided to install a new serpentine belt tensioner which is bolted to the water pump at the same time . Parts fit perfect and no leaks !	1
Used to replace a failed ( frozen , whoops ) pump on my 2002 Chevy Silverado 5.3L and its running very well , no leaks . Make sure you order the ACDelco 15-11057 thermostat because nothing else will fit . If you order a thermostat to match your vehicle , it will not fit because this unit 's outlet is smaller than OEM . Also , make sure you save the factory bolts and use blue thread lock before re-installing . I 've also read reviews about the 2 thermostat bolts that come with unit having a breaking issue , so I did n't even risk it and just used my old ones . Again , use the blue thread lock when reusing bolts . Another tip : use a little hand held razor scraper to clean the entire face of the the block where you will be setting the new pump into , removing any crust or build up before installing the new one . I also used a thin skim-coat of RTV water pump sealant around all gaskets and bolt holes . Just a little reinforcement since the gaskets are usually the first to go on the water pump .	1
I purchased this water pump to replace the original failed unit ( coolant dripping from the weep hole ) on my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3 non-flex . The pump was boxed inside a box which was nice . Prime $ 3.99 next day shipping was also a plus . This pump is `` Made in Canada '' and is OEM GM . It comes with everything you need including 2 reusable gaskets and the 2 bolts for the water inlet housing . You will need to reuse the 6 original mounting bolts though.While looking ALMOST identical to the original pump , the thermostat/water inlet is slightly smaller on the new pump . The original thermostat is integral to the original inlet and it 's physically too big to fit in the new pump . Luckily I purchased GM Part # 12600172ACDelco 15-11057 Water Pump Inletfrom Amazon at the same time . Together they are a perfect fit .	1
I purchased this to replace the water pump on my 2004 GMC Sierra 1500 and it fit perfectly . It does not come with mounting bolts but it DOES include a pair of gaskets and the water pump inlet bolts . Based on the advice of others , here , I elected to purchase the ACDelco 15-11057 Water Pump Inlet to go with this ( which fit perfectly ) and reuse my original inlet bolts . I also used Permatex 22071 Water Pump and Thermostat RTV Silicone Gasket on each side of the gaskets as well as between the water pump and the water pump inlet.In case it might help another , the torque spec for the water pump inlet bolts on my truck was 11 ft-lbs , while the torque spec for the water pump mounting bolts called for 37 ft-lbs .	1
I bought two of these for my twin-engine boat . The hour meter portion works fine , but the tachometer is unreliable and continually jumps between accurate and random readings . I 've re-connected them multiple times , carefully following the instructions , and they just do n't work right . But again , it 's a good hour meter that is easy to read .	1
It works great.I use it to tune small engine in our shop [ ... ] .I can see how I would not use these for a permanent mounted deal on a vehicle but we use these all the time tuning.Also when use none contact tachs for diesels.It seems all of the lower ratings are from people mounting them and the high ratings are for people that use them like I do .	1
easy to install , needed a tach to set the idle on my 1988 EL250B2 , I was way to low in the rpms . now i know why the battery was n't staying charged.i recommend this product to all those who are not really ace mechanics , just wrap the wire around the number one spark plug wire on multi cylinder engine and your done .	1
I purchased this digital tach for 2 stroke chainsaws that I port , the tach works perfect , it gives me a no load rpm as a starting point foradjusting the carbs , it also works perfect in the cut so you can dial inthe rpm you want the saw running at full throttle while cutting woodunder heavy load , before purchasing this tach I would do all my tuning by ear , I was always pretty close but with this tach I can now tune saws to perfection .	1
I noticed I 'm making 1.5 additional MPGs on my Optima SX , the performance difference is not that significant , but , you feel more response when ECO is on with this filter .	1
I installed this is my 2011 Hyundai sontata gls . Easy to install and wash . I have had it for almost 3 years not ( 67000 miles ) and just take out and wash and oil as needed . All my car I install K & N as soon as I buy them .	1
Bought these filters for 2012 Sonata GLS and 2010 Kia Sedona . Was attracted to them because they last life of vehicle , but also curious about potential performance and fuel economy gains . After a couple of months in both vehicles I have not noticed any gain in performance at all and fuel economy is exactly the same . I just hope they work as well or better at filtering than other standard filters .	1
TestVariables-Car = 27k miles- tire pressure ( 35psi ) -Oil ( Royal Prpl ) -Weather-TransitResults after changing filter/oil/oil filter ( Royal Prpl ) Average mpg gain ( 50miles daily driving ) = more/less 3.2mpgAfter getting to know the car a little , performance ( responsiveness ) has increase.I do recommend this to others	1
I used this on my 13 ' sonata turbo limited . Dealership wanted 50 bucks to replace filter with a stock paper filter . Seemed like a lot of money to pop 2 clips , take filter out and put new one back in . Installation in this car was a lot easier than in other cars because the filter slots into the box , making the seal and closing of the air box effortless . I guess the tool that puts the filters in at the dealership is pretty expensive lol . This is almost 25-30 $ more than the paper filter , but it flows a little more air , and still cheaper than the dealer . There is the 100K warranty thing , but requires services just as often as you 'd replace a paper filter which costs about the same as the regular filter ( part only , from amazon ) . Putting the filter in took me quite a while almost 30 minutes . That 's only because there were quite a few leaves in the air box that I needed to vacuum , and my shop vac was n't working so I had to get my house vac . Otherwise it would have been a 10-15 minute affair . As far as performance , and sound , I could n't really tell any difference . I 've used these filters on all my cars and I like the slight performance and mpg boost from them . With other cars that I 've put it in , I usually notice a 1 mpg boost which makes me feel like the filter pays for itself . I 've only owned the car for a month but I 've noticed about the same 1 mpg boost so far .	1
I purchased this filter for my 11 Kia Optima . Filter give better fuel millage and I save money by not having to spend 10+ dollars on air filters every oil change .	1
Before K & N ; 21.08 41 tank fillsAfter the K & N ; 22.59 4 tank fills 1-3-12My gas mileage has increased since I installed the K & N ; filter . I replaced the filter the Santa Fe came with after a year . On my 1994 Toyota Pickup the mileage went up about 1 mpg . To prevent most people from being bored I have the specifics at the bottom of the review.I have used K & N ; filters since the 1980 's and I have never had any problem caused by increased engine wear or component damage . Being a mechanic I maintain my own vehicles . In 2010 I sold my 1994 Toyota Pickup that I had new since 1994 and it had a K & N ; since 1995 . It has over 130,000 miles on it , does not burn oil , and is still running for the third owner with the K & N ; I purchased back in 1995 . My 1996 Honda Civic is still running for the third owner with the K & N ; I purchased as well . I will not bore you with the rest of my vehicles that used K & N ; filters . Being parsimonious I thoroughly investigate products and keep my vehicles as long as possible . I get the best parts because of safety and who wants to redo because you use cheap parts ? I have tracked the gas mileage on my 2011 Santa Fe since it was new . I got the car December 10 , 2010 . My average mileage before the K & N ; filter was 21.08 and the last two fill ups before the K & N ; I got 19.32 and 19.65 probably due to the winter gas blend . After K & N ; I got 24.72 , 20.48 , 21.69 , and 23.46.I take the miles driven and divide by the gallons added . To date my average mileage is 21.22 and the mileage calculator the car has is 22.73 . The car 's calculator is off by 6.64 % and it is factory calibrated with gas without ethanol and my 2003 Corolla gets about 7.83 less mileage with ethanol so the car 's calculator would be off by 1.19 if I could buy ethanol free gas using this calculation.For my ethanol info read the comment .	1
Bought this product so I could add some exterior lighting to my trailer . They seem like they will do the trick even though I have not had the chance to use them . Wish I could have found them in black cause then I would not have had to spray paint them .	1
I had read all of the other good reviews on this light and hoped that it would meet those expectations upon arrival and It did.I am impressed with the overall design and composition of the light . The lens and housing are lightweight yet durable and made really well considering the weight of materials used . Possesses a good quality bulb socket and switch as well.Although the light can be used for exterior applications , please note : the light fixture is not watertight . The back panel is thin gauge sheet metal and has mounting holes drilled through it , the sheet metal is recessed ever so slightly into the fixture housing . This allows the housing to mount tight against most surfaces . There is a water 'seepage slot ' cut into the bottom most portion of the housing if some water were to gain access into the light fixture from above . The manner in which the clear lens snaps into the white , outer housing seems that it would readily shed water and prevent entrance in this region.I have one of mine installed in my camper shower and have nothing but praise for this light . Never had any issues . Very nice light ... .super happy with it.Chris	1
Replaced my 2001 lights with these new ones they work good and mounted into the existing holes that were left by the old ones . Good product and arrived just as scheduled .	1
Used it to replace the old light on our RV and it lights up the tongue area very nicely at night .	1
Thanks , just . As described and great price compared to local shops , , you have put nite lite into my dark nights , , , , , ,	1
I recommend this . Works well . If anything I wish I bought more.It is good to have a tube handy .	1
not a single leak after a full season . Usually I get a few new cracks or leaks , but this stuff stays flexible . Nice	1
The product does exactly what it is designed to do ... it seals fully around roof vents and other problems for our motorhome . Easy to apply	1
I always buy the Dicor . I am sure there are others that are good but I wo n't take that chance so I get the Dicor.It works . It flows evenly and sticks well . You need to remember that lap sealant is self leveling and can only be used on a level roof . The only drawback is the price .	1
Does exactly what it is suppose to . Use it on cracks in existing caulk . Stopped my antennae leak . Emergency fix till I recoat entire rook	1
Use with EPDM Adhesive roofing around vent flanges . Worked well but if it is cold set near heat to warm up and makes it a breeze to work with , , price locally was twice this price ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Thanks	1
neat that it aslo does tire wear , but it can range quite abit depending on what point you take the reading from or how you hold the unit .	1
100 % absolutely love this product . The only down side to this product is you can not use it really well to deflate your tires that easily . Otherwise , for it 's intended use , it 's amazing . Costs a little more than your standard gauge , but this is a great 2 in 1 item !	1
I do n't have much to compare this to but the gauge works and has been able to help me keep my tires as they should be . Quality is good .	1
I just purchased a second Accutire MS-48B after losing my last one in a totaled car . It is not the most ergonomic or sturdy gauge , but it works well and is affordable . I like having a numeric measurement of tire tread depth rather than using a coin . The large display makes it easy to read the results.In short , while it is not the best or heavy duty , I bought another one because it works well for the price .	1
The does what it says,1 . Measures tire pressure . I do this every two weeks in combination with a portable air compressor while the car has been sitting for a few hours to make sure my tires are at proper pressure . I have noticed an extra half to full week of extra gas.2 . Make sure the tire is safe to drive on via the tire depth tool.It has a built in battery save feature which has always worked for me.I highly recommend this product and for the price I promise you wont regret it.If this review helped you please let me know . Thanks and happy shopping .	1
When I opened the package , the wiring harness was gone . A quick phone call to Amazon , and they had one on the way to me . This thing is very easy to install , but the bolts take some finesse unless the bumper is removed . In retrospect , removing the bumper would have been easier and probably faster , but I just used some needle nose pliers and a little patience . It seems sturdy enough , and is rated at 3500lbs . I 'll update the review if the receiver proves to not be sturdy.Better directions , or at least more forthcoming directions would have gotten this 5 stars .	1
I 'm not a handy person ... but this was ridiculously easy to install . After reading the reviews , I decided to take the bumper off which in my case was about 8 bolts . I used a hand torque wrench to get everything snug and put everything back together and had the wiring hooked up in about an hour . The only mistake I made was 'installing ' or rather pushing the white plugs into the frame of the Jeep to hold the wiring near the frame prematurely . I should have lined everything up and made sure I had found all of the holes before I shoved them in . Ended up needing to take out two of the 'plugs ' and did n't know how to properly do it which led to them breaking . I just used a couple of small zip ties to hold the wiring up and I am good to go .	1
This is about the 5th or 6th time I rated this as now I know how they get so many ratings . This item fits a 2009 Jk jeep perfect and the light harness works awesome to . They will run you close to a hundred bucks local so this is a great deal . No problems . Thanks Amazon . Shipping and receiving were very good with no problems .	1
This receiver hitch is very easy to install and is made of high quality steel . The welds are very neatly done . Installation does not require bumper removal as previous reviews stated . Wiring was easy to install as well with a nice feature to attach to the frame of my Jeep .	1
Simple to install if you just pull the back bumper . Can be done without , but it was faster to pull it rather than fight with bolts in tight spots . Holds my Allen 5 bike rack no problem .	1
Installed on a 2012 Jeep Wrangler . Very easy to install . I did n't even need the instructions ! Very solid made . Would recommend .	1
I was looking for a simple hitch , and this was a much better price than from my dealership . Not too hard to install .	1
Went on fairly well , no issues at all . Had to buy the ball mount separately and it fit just fine .	1
solid . well designed . easy install . plug and play was really nice . very sturdy . worked perfectly . instructions don & # 8217 ; t tell you this , but you have to remove the rear bumper to install the receiver . only took about 30 minutes total . having a second person helped .	1
Fits , bolts right up with no problems . Wire harness is good , Price is right , Quality is great . What more do you need .	1
No problems what so ever . Price is great and install is super easy . I would recommend this product to any Jeep JK owner whose Jeep is not equipped with trailer hitch .	1
Great deal for hitch and wiring . The hardest part was figuring out where the holes were on the body for the fasteners already on the wiring harness . Simple to install . fits perfect .	1
Fits perfect . Took me 30 minutes to do it by myself . Comes with easy to follow directions . No reason to spend more . Get this one .	1
I just installed this today . Everything looks good and works well on my 2012 jk . The bolts are metric 8.8 . That 's equivalent to grade 5 . The hitch fit on the crossmember easily with about an 1/8 '' gap . When tightened down the gap went away . The powder coat looks good.INSTALL TIPSI was able to install the hitch without removing anything by duck tapeing the washer and nut on . You need to tape 2 opposite sides of the nut and washer . I also taped the nut and washer separate . The bolt is 19mm ( you 'll need an open ended wrench this size or 3/4 '' ) and the nut is 18mm ( you 'll want a socket for that ) . I put a bar over my ratchet to get the bolt torqued down real good . I would wear safety goggles and bring a small pillow to rest your head on.The wire harness is easy to install . You only need to unscrew the 2 innermost screws on the driver break light ( the outside 2 just hold the light cover on ) . Then just wiggle it a bit and it will pop off . Put the screws back in a few turns right after removal so you dont lose them . You unplug the wire harness for the driver break light by pressing the middle `` button '' on the harness and wiggle . The trailer harness goes in that spot . The wire easily runs through a hole in the bottom of that cavity . I ran the wire over the top of the frame rail and behind the body bolt . I would add a couple 14 '' zip ties to back up the push plugs . The push plugs attach to the wire loom with just a couple wraps of electrical tape.The whole install should take about an hour and is rather easy . Anyone can do this .	1
I bought my Jeep Wrangler new , but skipped on the towing package option for one reason : I knew very well that I could find a hitch and cables MUCH cheaper here on Amazon.And , I did ... Rugged Ridge makes quality Jeep parts , so I do not expect this hitch to fail me in its duties.I also do not expect it to rot out over the course of a few years ( if it does , I will definitely be updating this review ) .Anyway , this hitch and cable are painfully simple to install . *Even if one posses little mechanical know-how , it should install within an hour . *Though , if you possess so little mechanical knowledge that the thought of installing a trailer hitch frightens you , perhaps a Jeep is not the proper vehicle for you to be driving.~Rusty	1
Just like everyone else who has reviewed this hitch I had the same results . My welds were all solid and overall the quality of construction was very good . The square tube the receiver slides into was a little cockeyed . It is n't quite square with the brackets so when the hitch is installed it is slightly rotated to the right . With all of that said the hitch and wiring were $ 62 shipped , nearly half the cost of what a resse hitch alone is without the wiring . I 'm very pleased and I have no worries at all towing anything with this hitch . If the receiver portion was n't slightly twisted I would give it 5 stars . The harness is good quality , the wiring is durable and thick , not flimsy harbor freight quality . If you are doing a lot of mods on your jk and trying to stay on a budget I would n't hesitate to recommend this .	1
My husband installed the Rugged Ridge Black Receiver Hitch Kit on my 2012 Jeep Wrangler Sport , in less than an hour all by himself . Not only was it easy to install , but we towed a full 8'x6 ' trailer from Ohio to Florida and back and it did great ! !	1
This hitch is very well made ... maybe some of the older feedback got thru to someone , because the welding looks like smooth caulk and the fit is perfect . I installed it without removing the bumper , but as others have said , it 's a bit tedious and difficult to get the nuts threaded , but not impossible . The wiring harness is also a snap to install . Highly recommended	1
I read several of the reviews and was hesitant to buy this product . The alternatives were much more expensive , so I went ahead and ordered it . The shipment came quickly and when I went to install it , I was unsure if I really needed to remove the rear bumper or not.When I got underneath to locate the position of the mounting holes , it was clear I needed to remove the bumper . I have a 2012 Wrangler Sport , and you ca n't insert the bolts from inside out because the exhaust system is in the way . I had to take off the bumper and put the bolts in opposite of how the instructions stated . But the bumper is just six easy access bolts , and I got it off , the hitch installed and the bumper back on in less than 40 minutes.Wiring through the tail light was a breeze as well , nothing more than taking off the covers , disconnecting the existing wiring and making the new connections , then fish the wires through the body and out the bottom.Great product , easy installation .	1
Easy install and solid as a rock ! Wiring harness fit perfectly and was also an easy install . Would recommend to anyone .	1
The unit we received is actually labeled as a Soliport ELM 327 Bluetooth OBDII OBD2 Diagnostic Scanner , ELM327 wireless OBD 2 Scan tool check Engine Light CAR CODE READER , not a Elandpower . I am guessing that these are `` generic '' devices manufactured in the same factory and just labeled with different seller 's stickers.That being said , the device we received works better than I expected and performs all of the functions that the scanner should be able to do on my 2009 Chrysler Town and Country mini-van . I did not use the software on the mini-CD and could not really find anything useful on the disc . I am using the paid version of the `` Torque '' application for my HTC EVO ( Android ) and have not experienced any issues with slow response or drop-outs over Bluetooth ( connection pairing code `` 1234 '' ) .Recommended for the device functionality , but your experience may vary based on the device you actually receive and the application you choose to use as a monitor.CFH	1
I downloaded torque free and checked out how customizable it was then saw how cheap the bluetooth i/f was for it . I ordered it and 18 hours later it was on my doorstep . From there I made some custom screnes which the free version is not more than a demo - I bought the 4.95 torque pro and behold 100+ obd2 items and tons of display formats in 5 sizes on 11 screens were customizable in front of me.I run a droid bionic stock in a lapdock display screen - as soon as the 327 was in my honda pilot it figured it out without any work from me . I had to enter my engine displacement and drive over a scale at a truckstop I know to weigh the vehicle but from there I get 11 pages of digital numeric data , graphs over time , dial gages with bugs ( those low / high tabs that stick to the range you run through ) along with the vocal anouncement of when your engine is up to temperature and ready to perform and any alarms that come up.Today I moved my 16 mpg to 45 mpg avg just by using a screen with average and instantaneous mileage side by side with engine load . It turned out running the a/c at a stop sign really uses more gas from the short term fuel trim levels and the engine load demand graph going from 30 at idle to 42 with the ac on , fans on at the radiator , and fans on front/rear seats . It is so precise you can see the impact of running the headlights as alternator load on the engine.The numeric data is accurate to 1 unit ( e.g . 1 percent load on 0-100 % or 1 rpm in 0-6500 rpm ) - it even showed the extra fuel used to heat the seat . OBDII even gives you the available fuel in the tank digitally - I discovered it holds back 10 % in case you need to limp home . RPM ( tach ) is both analog dial and digital numerics with the number ( e.g . 741 rpm ) in the center of the dial . You can check speed from gps or from obd2 and check for errors in your speedo due to tire size etc . It also makes good use of the droid x , y , z g force meters and once programmed for your vehicle ( you can setup many vehicles and move the BT adapter ) it will time your 0-60 ( be sure to change to english units as the author appears to come from a metric country ) - also change gallons to us imperial gallons.Many of the dials are calculated in the droid or taken from the sensors and gps . I am running a stock bionic dual proc 1 ghz phone with ample computational power . It has a logging function and will save every 1 , 3 , or 5 seconds to an xls or csv file.A friend dropped by last night before smog checking his 2000 yukon - we found 4 error codes and fixed the problems then oblitterated all signs the codes were ever in the ecu - passed smog the today ( in CALIFORNIA ! ) like a charm.Basically the 5 buck s/w and 15 buck h/w gives you a sun diag tool complete with code lookup tables so you know where to check for faults ( o2 sensor , fuel injector , fuel rail pressure , etc ) With 11 screens you can develop a mileage screen , troubleshooting display , default 6 dial display that comes on the center page . Using the HDMI output to a large monitor you can use the tiny displays ( pro comes with 5 sizes of display ) and they are 100 % readable . other pages will show barometric pressure , coolant temp , battery voltage , and it even works with the key in and the engine stoppedSo if you are droid based a jackson sets you up with a full sun auto analyzer that even can upload data logs and make phone calls . I 'm still reading into the program but it appears it will show you your path on a map and overlay the places you floored the pedal to cross 4 lanes of traffic .I also used it in a 1995 gm 5.7 L V8 TBI which was OBD 1.5 - some sensors were marked out , but open loop closed loop smog was there , as was the codes stored and their meaning ( the engine runs 3 secs then stops ) . So in 3 days I used it in 3 cars with utter amazement . I 'll buy my mechanic a droid and one of these just so he can maintain the fleet vehicles with ease and save 480 bucks off a sun engine analyzer . It even shows timing advance/retard during shifts and short term fuel trim/long term fuel trim - a serious diagnostic tool for most 1995-1996 and later vehicles . I 'm dying to try it on a prius.I 'm very happy the auto makers standardized on obd2 pretty much across the board from honda , gm , ford , am general , etc . It 's definitely a 5 star system and paired with the bionic app and the sender from fenley amazon 's warehouse . It comes with a 3.5 inch pc cdrom but i 'm using the droid and lapdock for ease of readability in the passenger seat .	1
Sure , it lags a little bit , but that could be the adapter , the ODBII system , or the Bluetooth adapter , so I ca n't chalk it up to this device.Never ... EVER ... did I think I 'd be able to 'hack ' a vehicle using a laptop.Ever .	1
The OBDII reader works perfectly on my 2001 Ford Explorer Sport Trac . Torque Free & Pro for android receiving real time updates and error code readouts without any issues ( in my case PO401 . ) Bluetooth pairing was the same as any other device would be ( pair code=1234 . ) The product I received is a bit different than the product photo . Although Same in size and shape , the port is reversed in relation to the LED/sticker putting the LEDs face down when plugged in . The sticker image ( ie : the whole top ) is also completely different . While not an issue , I feel it is worth mentioning . The only actual issue I had with this purchase was the included mini CD . It 's a typical blank cd one can find in the electronic section of any store but it seems someone forgot to burn anything to it . I never planned on using the PC software anyways and now have a free blank CD to burn stuff to . : / In all , I would recommend this product , The OBDII reader deserves 5 stars but the listing is getting 4 due to inaccurate listing and absent software .	1
I was so pleased to find a much lower priced and greater amount appliqu & eacute ; for all the gaskets to the compound retractable hardtop of my VW Eos . I also now apply to my other cars ' general door gaskets .	1
Perfect size and consistency for quickly treating your car 's door/window seals . Product is not too oily , unlike other multi-purpose products . I use it for both classic cars and daily drivers .	1
Another Einszett product that I 'll always keep in the garage . Works great on all the rubber , wish I would have used it from the the day my car was new so the seals never needed to be reconditioned .	1
I use this on the rubber trim on my old Mercedes . I live in South Carolina , so the intense heat and constant sunlight ( I do n't have a garage ) does a number on exterior trim pieces . This stuff makes them look and feel like new . It 's amazing . I 'll try to remember to upload some pictures later .	1
Own BMW 328i coupe ( no frame window ) . Bought this product expecting to reduce my wind noise coming from door . This product cleaned and shined my rubber seals but did not stop windnoise .	1
Surely they could come up with a better applicator . Maybe something like a wedge shaped one . I have to use my finger it tight places and corners . But it does seem to rehydrate rubber and restore it 's original black color . So far it 's lasted a few weeks and still looks good.To bad it could n't actually reverse the deteriorating.. Now that would be the product of the year !	1
I used this to restore some life on some rubber trim I had on my car . It did a great job . I tried it on some plastic and it did n't work as good .	1
Someone has finnally produced a rubber protectant with an applicator that makes sense . I am able to quickly and easily apply the protectant to the seals of my doors and my moon roof . Furthermore , the rubber seals maintain their new appearance . I used this product on a friends 3-year old car seals that appeared cracked and dry due to have UV exposure and this product has brought them back to new . The previously dry feeling rubber seals are now clean and pliable , like new . Amazing ! What a great piece of mind that my car 's rubber seals are protected from UB damage and will hopefully last longer .	1
This product is great , the rubber trim on my 01 Taurus had a grey look and cracks all over.After using this on the trim , it makes the cracks less visible , and restored a decent amount of the black color back to it.Overall , I 'm really satisfied with the product .	1
This works great on the rubber trim around car door windows , but from using this after quite a few car washes , the foam applicator ripped off . No good way of putting it back on .	1
This is some pretty amazing stuff . After reading all the reviews , I decided to try some on the sunroof seals on my wife 's Civic Si . They were looking horrible from sitting out in the South Texas sun for several years . It had cracked badly and one place and was dry and cracking pretty much everywhere else.One application made an amazing amount of difference . The seals were much more flexible and did n't look grey and dry anymore . The large crack is still there , but it 's smaller and less visible.I 've only had to apply twice in the last year , and the seals still look great .	1
This product should be sold at all auto parts stores ! Very easy to apply and keeps ALL of your auto 's seals lubricated and in good condition . Does n't leave behind any residue and therefore , will not stain clothes as some other products do .	1
Helps replenish seals on older cars and keeps seals on newer cars from drying out . Actually plumps seals up to reduce wind noise and prevent leaks .	1
My AC was barely blowing cool air , so I thought I 'd give this a try before taking it to a shop . I followed the directions that came with it , and it worked exactly as advertised . When I hooked up the hose to the low pressure port with the Air running on max , it registered 12psi , which is low . That fortunately told me there 's no leak because the system is holding pressure . I filled the system mid-way through the safe zone to about 35psi , and the truck is now blowing cold air . I plan to wait a week and hook it up again just to make sure it 's holding the 35 pounds . Would definitely buy again if I need it .	1
Basically idiot proof . You just need to find out the correct port to fill . I do n't notice it make the air colder , but I do notice it makes it faster . I knocked off one star because I think the gauge was n't accurate . I put in 4/5 of the bottle in my car and the needle did n't move at all . I checked that it was on secure and the car was running with full blast . However , the gauge did work in another vehicle I tested . I would recommend to anyone	1
i just did what it says on the can , most of it went in a little leakage but whatever to tune it up yourself whatever , air is COLD now , air was cold before but after SUPER CHILL .	1
My daughter watched a video and put this in her truck easily . She reported her ears were frozen after a summer of no AC today . Had to turn down both the temp and blower . I would say this product is a success .	1
I first bought the charging and measuring kit ( hose and gauge ) that screws onto134a cans and it was a total disaster as the screw on metal fitting leaked and wastedmost of the two cans of 134a I had.I went back to Oreilly 's and bought this product , and it worked great .	1
Takes a little effort to get the bolts out ( unless you have an impact wrench , which I did not ) . They are very accessible , and an impact would have certainly fit . I used a rubber mallet and ratchet with an 18mm socket . The install time states 15 minutes . That must include the time to read the directions and open the box . This is a zero effort ( besides breaking the bolts loose ) install.The box is solid , I am very happy with it .	1
Excellent lockable storage for your 2009 JK Jeep under the front driver seat . 2 bolt install , or about 10 mins . time to put in . Great product for the money and to keep things safe . Thanks Amazon .	1
I was a little sceptical when reading some of the other reviews . I did a visual inspection on my Jeep before ordering and found the bracket that holds the electrical connectors for my seat ( air bag and heater ) could easily be removed . ( issues noted in other posts ) Once the product arrived I had it installed in 38 minutes ( including time searching for an 18mm socket and setting up my air hose / impact wrench ) .Tools I used:18mm socketImpact wrench ( you could use a standard ratchet , but I like my air tools ! ) 1/4 '' ratchet1/4 '' drive Torx 25 socketWire cuttersFlashlightZip ties ( x2 ) Step 1 : Remove the electrical bracket.I used wire cutters to cut the plastic tabs that poked thru the bracket holding the electrical connectors . Not enough room to move under the seat ( or muscle ) so I just cut them ( carefully ! ) .Once the bracket was removed using the 1/4 '' drive Torx 25 , I zip tied the electrical wires loosely to the seat cross bar and slid the seat to each limit making sure the wires would not rip apart . The connectors were zip tied to the far right ( center console ) side of the seat allowing enough room for the box to slide in easily . Once I knew they were OK I tightened the zip ties and moved on.Step 2 : Install the box.Slide the seat all the way back.Use the 18mm socket / racthet ( impact wrench ) to remove the 2 front seat bolts.Carefully slide the box under the seat making sure wires are not being pulled and align the holes.Install both bolts and tighten.Step 3 : Verify drawer and seat operation.Drawer operation.Using the key open the drawer while sitting in the seat . ***Caution****Seat operation.- I drive with the seat in the lowest manual setting -When sitting in the seat and attempting to slide the seat forward ( SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY ! ! ) I found that the seat hits the box and CAN NOT slide far enough forward where my wife likes the seat.The ONLY way I could make the seat slide forward with my 200lb rear in it was to raise the seat 2 pulls on the height adjuster . Its not a bad position so I will attempt to leave it there so my Call of Duty leather seat does n't get tore up by accident.The only thing I thought could be better was putting a `` thumb pull '' tab thingy around the lock so you could grap it and pull the drawer open . Turns out the key wo n't come out in the unlock position and it can be used to pull the drawer open.I am very pleased with this product and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a secure / hidden storage in thier Jeep !	1
A solid , easy to install , lock box . Do n't be fooled , easy to install with the right tools , and the bad guys wo n't be able to just snatch it out or pop the door open . It 's nice and easy to use and seems like it 'll last .	1
Installed in a JKU 2012 . Less than 20 minutes to install . Removed little bracket under seat and it silde right into place . I will remove this from JKU if I ever sell it and use it in my next Jeep . Holds more junk than I believed it would have . Only problem was the shipping box did not make the trip from intact ( I live about 120 miles from shipping location ) , but the safe did not have any damage at all .	1
I originally installed a unit under the passengers seat . I liked the unit so much that I obtained this one for the drivers seat . It is well made and strong . The unit also perfectly aligns with the seat mounting post on my 2012 Jeep Wrangler unlimited.I may decide to change the lock one day though . I was surprised when I discovered that the key that I had for the first one also fit this one . I wonder if that is the case for all of the units . If so , then all a thief has to do is to buy one of these units and then they can start targeting Jeeps .	1
This lock box is just like a mini vault . It 's not going anywhere without a struggle . The way it is attached to the bolts that hold the seat in works great . Easy to install for the mechanically inclined . I added some Loctite to the threads to make it even harder to remove , I liked it so much I got one for my truck . I think it 's a great idea for added security besides the trunk of a vehicle . I carry extra keys , gas card , my pistol , which I feel is secure enough that anyone who wanted to break in the box will certainly will have to make extra effort to do so.. Will worth the money !	1
fits great , sturdy . 20 minute install . seat bolts were tough to break loose	1
Bought this item hoping it would fit my 2011 4-door Wrangler Sahara . Other than the previously noted wiring harness bracket ( removes in a couple seconds with a torx wrench ) it was an easy install and looks like it could be an OE product . Very impressed .	1
It 's Summer and time to take the top down and put the tube doors and mesh top on my 2007 Jeep Wrangler . But all that frest air and open-air makes the Jeep tempting for opportunity thieves ! I installed a heavy steel glove box in the dash and rang across this looking for other ideas . It took me about 30 minutes to install it ( hardest part is removing the bolts in front of the driver side seat ) . I suggest an impact wrench if you have one ; I used an 18 & # 34 ; socket arm to get enough leverage to loosen the bolts . Overall I like the box and the extra security to store items when I leave the Jeep in a parking lot and run inside a store for a short period of time . I would not suggest use for areas where you will be away from the Jeep for extended time or in remote areas for long . It 's a lock box , but the more time you give a thief , the more time they will have to spend to defeat this box ! There are a couple of downsides that I would like to see Bestop consider : ( 1 ) Make the box slightly wider ; ther is room on the non-sloped side to add an inch or so and would give more options to what would fit in the box ( 2 ) Run the padding all the way up on the sides of the box ; some items will slide around in the box and could be damaged or scratched ( 3 ) MAKE one for under the passengers side seat as well ! I know there are wires under there , but they can be moved easilyOverall , If you own a Jeep Wrangler , check the year and make sure this box fits your Jeep . I think you will like the unit and is pretty good quality for the money you invest .	1
great product . Loosening the screws holding the seat down was the only hard part . The easy solution is use an impact wrench and they 'll come right off .	1
Install was super easy , two bolts and you 're done . Fits nicely under the front driver seat . Did lots of looking before buying . Quality is top notch . Only complaint is that the drawer does not fully extend out to see the back part of the drawer . Not a deal breaker . Drawer is big enough for most anything and has a carpet lining . Good value for the money .	1
This thing is bullet proof . I would like it to be slightly wider to hod something bigger , but real protects your valuables in a pinch .	1
Easily installed after the seat bolts were loosened . One key was bent , but the company immediately sent new locking mechanism w/2 keys . It 's great , out of the way , and holds my valuables . I would recommend this item for everyone ... Not just gun owners ... however ... if concerned about width/depth ... this will hold a Glock 22 w/magazine in a Blackhawk holster .	1
This Michelin Stealth wiper blade is a combination of classic standard metal frame and brand new flex beam wipers . It is an outstanding wiper blade.My 2002 Buick Rendezvous hated the Bosch Icon wiper blades ( expensive and wore out quickly ) . It tolerated the Goodyear Assurance blades ( good price , bad connecting clip , and wore out a bit early ) . Both are the flat beam one piece design , everything is in a sealed flexible bar.Michelin has come up with a blade that combines the best of both worlds . The blade itself is a standard steel frame with a high tech rubber blade . It is then covered with a flexible boot that looks like the flat beam style blades . The combination is great pressure against the window , an airfoil to press the blade down at high speed , and a boot to protect the frame from getting jammed with snow or ice.The business part of the blade is a very fine smooth rubber blade . In theory it could be replaced , but Michelin did n't put a clip on the end of the blade.Installation , well I 'm not a huge fan of their clipping mechanism . Bosch actually got this way right , an easy to insert U zone and a snap cap over the connection . Most U shaped connectors have a tab inside the U to remove the blade . Michelin went with two clips at the end of the U . It will be no fun to remove these when they wear out.This is a classic great wiper blade .	1
I recently bought these for my wife 's Honda Odyssey and they are hands down better than the Bosch Icon blades I got for my Dodge Charger . They make great contact and are constructed well . Installation was also easy . If you are looking for new wiper blades and like the beam style then these will do the trick . ***UPDATE***After using a while they have kind of a warm up period and do n't work all that well right away . It helps to clean them with a wet cloth occassionally . The stock wipers were the same way . I still think they are great in terms of contact .	1
I bought a pair of these to replace a pair of Mopar Wiper Blades . I finally got tired of them , decided to switch to try another brand to try . They work perfectly ; no streaking or smearing at all . They make firm contact with the windshield.When it rains it leaves my windshield spotless.These work great at removing snow as well , unlike traditional wiper blades where snow gets stuck in the frames . Let 's see how it does when it snows ... .But I would definitely recommend these wiper blades : So far , they are the best that I 've ever used on my car . My only main concern is it 's made in China usually things made there are n't of good quality from my experience . The Mopar or Motor craft wiper blades I tried before were made in the U.S. Let 's see how long these will hold up ... .	1
I have used the Stealth Wiper Blades a few times now and continue to be amazed at how good they are and their long life ( I always wipe of the blade when I get gas to keep it clean ) . What sells me on them is the aerodynamics of the blade over the competition .	1
Wal-Mart shoppers , and Hyundai or Kia owners should n't be reviewing these.You know what owning a Hyundai or Kia tells the world ? It tells the world you know nothing about cars or how they work.I 've run these on several of my cars and they perform with aplomb .	1
works good and will probably last ah while longer than my original set , so far so good , until i see how long it last , for now it works fine	1
In my opinion these are the best windshield wipers I 've bought . I replaced the ones it came with when I first bought my Explorer so until yesterday Dec 20 , 2012 . ( Felt the need to change wipers the day before Dec 21 2012 just in case haha . I 've used them during hurricane Irene , Sandy heavy rainfall and it always worked with perfection . Not one time it did leave my windshield blurry .	1
Installed on other truck and loved performance so much that I decided on these for another truck..Great design to keep snow and ice from inner works and give clean , squeak free wiping of the glass .	1
I like to invest in things that work well . . . and these do . At any speed , they hug the windshield and clean it like a great squeegee held in the hand of a professional . I do recommend them for your vehicle if you want better wipers .	1
These blades slipped on the wiper arms very easily , and locked into place . Used these models to replace the older Michelin type which also worked well . Will defeinitely buy from this vendor again , quick shipping too .	1
So far so good , quiet and wipes good although i had an original Michelin brand that has lasted two years almost and these newer ones seem cheaper in quality of plastic used . Seems kinda cheap but as long as it stays on , against window , and lasts i 'll buy some more .	1
For the price these gloves are very good.Maybe ordering a size larger than you normally wear would be a good idea .	1
Bought these two months ago and I 've driven about 2500 miles in them so far . I love 'em . The interior of my car is all black leather , so they obviously look great . The leather helps me grip the wheel easily and keeps my hands from getting all clammy/gross/sticky while I eat , drive , get gas , etc.Ventilation is n't great - so your hands do have a tendency to get warm on long trips . Stick 'em out the window once in a while and you 'll be fine . I have n't had sunburn/tanlines from them yet - but I look forward to the day that I do .	1
The price was right and it saved me a drive to the local Toyota dealer to buy this filter . Genuine Toyota part .	1
changing oil filter in these new car are easier than ever . slight learn curve the first time , but should be simple later . the money i saved go to full synthetic oil .	1
I own a 2013 Camry SE . I do my own oil changes and other maintenance as much as I can to avoid going to the & # 34 ; stealer. & # 34 ; This filter works perfectly and changing the oil is pretty much a breeze . You will need the special wrench/ adapter .	1
Nice , delivery takes a while , but you save a lot of money buying them in greater quantity . OEM filters , ca n't go wrong . It is nice having them at home when I am ready to change the oil , rather than drive all over town looking for who carries a filter for my car .	1
An exact OEM filter for my 2011 V6 lexus RX350.Part number here is 04152-YZZA1 which appears to be the same for Toyota TRD # PTR43-00082 . Both will fit most current Lexus products ( excluding the LFA ? ) . Toyota changed from spin-off into element type filters starting with the 2008 model year but the Lexus had these since 2000 in the RX line . IMO , a strategy initiated to persuade owners to have maintenance done at dealerships . That wo n't work with me as I have changed oil in all my vehicles for the last couple of decades . Having worked at a high-end dealership and closely with the auto industry , I can tell you that they do oil changes as fast as your neighborhood & # 34 ; quick-lube & # 34 ; outlet . Many mechanics are professional and torque bolts properly but there are also an equal amount who just do n't care.Purchase your 0W20 synthetic oil from Amazon , as well as the proper filter socket and your oil change will cost you less than $ 50 . A huge difference from the minimum of $ 180 Lexus dealerships charge for the same job . Creates enough savings to drive your wife/partner and have decent dinner w/ wine ! ! ! !	1
This is the exact filter dealer change on my 2007 V6 lexus RX350.But , I do n't understand when I put my model on the matching model system , it kicked me out of the match.I went back to check the invoice when I brought my car back to Lexus dealship for service . This part number match exactly . I re-type part number here 04152-YZZA1 so you can be sure it fits your lexus.It looks like AMAZON needs to do more reserch for this part so they can sale more ...	1
works perfect on toyota highlander 2012 model good price and genuine factory item from toyota good to see pic on back of the cover its helpful	1
What else is there to say . Hope it holds up to holding my winch mount . We will find out . Blah	1
This is a great hitch pin . The clip slides through the pin more easily than the others that I have . The Rubber coating looks great . Should serve me well . Solid construction .	1
Any one who has a tow hitch needs a extra pin just in case . Cheep inshurance . I always keep a couple extras in my vehicle .	1
Does what it 's suppose to do ... nice addition with the added rubber coating makes it easy to handle ... and for the price it 's a steal !	1
It 's a standard hitch pin and clip from a reputable manufacturer , and it fits well . The vinyl-coated handle and clip are a nice touch which is easy to clean and feels nicer than a corroded `` regular '' pin or clip . And the price ( at the time of this review ) is actually less than the non-coated version , so it seems a no-brainer . I 'm going to buy a couple more just to have them on-hand .	1
Very nice hitch pin and I was surprised for the money.It 's a spare since people have a habit of stealing trailer balls and mounts around here .	1
This fits like a glove in my Curt receiver hitch . The rubber covers also aid in eliminating annoying rattles and squeaks . Well worth the money over non coated type .	1
Not much I can say , it 's a hitch pin and clip . The rubber coating covers the parts that see the most use so it may help out with surface rust and grip .	1
This hitch pin is a perfect fit for a 2x2 hitch . The coated portion helps with the grip to insert it or pull it out .	1
I give it 4 stars because it does not state for a 2 & # 34 ; hitch . I purchased another Curt product and it was for a 1 & # 34 ; hitch and did not work for my needs . I kept them because it was a hassle to return for the price I paid .	1
Not much to say here except for the money having the plasti-dipped parts is a nice plus . I purchased as a backup to my lock set . Used them one so far and would recommend to anyone wanting something similar .	1
A nice thick coating protects the end of the pin and clip . Other than that , they are just what you would expect .	1
So far works great . Not much to say but it holds my hitch in place and it works great at doing that it fit perfect and was here fast .	1
If you have a Nissan GL4 manual transmission that specifies 75/85w gear oil then this is the oil that you should use.Seems to have made the tranny shift a little better than the 75/90w royal purple that I used , especially when its cold.Safe for brass synchros , as it lacks the reactive sulfurs found in most GL-5 oils that cause damage .	1
I used this oil in my 2013 Elantra GT ( hatchback ) MT.I changed the factory OEM with this oil at 8000miles . I must say that I can trulllllllly feel the difference in how the gears are behaving and smooth the transmission has become . VERY VERY happy with this product . Change your MT oil with this oil and DONT LOOK BACK .	1
Put this in my 2010 Genesis Coupe 2.0T . Shifter feel is much improved . Upshifts and downshifts are much faster . 2nd gear always seemed to be hesitant to engage . After using this fluid , it goes in MUCH easier . Not perfect , but way better . Car took just over 2 quarts , so I bought 3 to fill the differential as well . Have n't had a chance to fill the differential yet , but plan to soon . This is one of the best things I 've done for my car ! Such an improved overall shifter feel .	1
I have a 2005 Hyundai Elantra with 100,000 miles . I put in MT-90 before , 30,000 miles ago , due to the fact that I could n't get the MT-85 quick enough . The MT-90 ran great but I wanted to go to the correct weight for my vehicle . That is why I switched . I have seen the same smooth shifting that I had with the MT-90 . This vehicle tends to grind when doing quick shifts from first to second and 90 removed that issue and it has not returned with the 85 either.I have noticed that the MT-85 feels different driving when compared to the MT-90 . I would say smoother and less resistance/free'r spinning but I will attribute this to being all in my head.I love the redline fluids . Knowing that this is full synthetic I know it will last longer than most regular fluid out there . The added piece of mind is worth the added cost and I would put redline MTF in any future vehicles as well .	1
Great fluid ! It 's in the gearbox of my 2012 Hyundai Genesis Coupe . Big improvement over the OEM fluid ! It 's hard to shift on cold days until the gearbox is warmed up though . But once it is up to temperature it is a huge improvement over the stock fluid .	1
I recently bought a new car and have decided to use only Mobil One products meaning oil and filters in this car . The filters came quickly and were a better price the the local brick store .	1
I 've been using the Mobil 1 oil filters for years now . I can really tell a difference in how long my oil stays clean .	1
The oil is cleaner longer with these filters . Nothing special about the exterior . I wish it had a no slip grip exterior.I will be buying again .	1
I always use Mobil1 synthetic oil ( 0W-40 ) on my sedans and change the oil every 10,000 miles . This is the Filter to match the oil . The interior is the same as the K & N one ... and cheaper !	1
If you want the best , this filter is among the best . The benefit of buying it thru Amazon , is that they have it in stock . Many stores do not carry this filter . I certainly do not want to hunt all over town looking for this filter .	1
2009 Infiniti G37Doing my first synthetic oil change using the mentioned combination . Both the oil and the filter have solid testing and numbers to prove the actual benefits.I just hit the 60k marker and will post my findings in a week . Also , whilst the car is in the air , gon na drain the trans ( 6MT ) and differential . Replacing with royal purple fluids.Reason for not using RP oil filter , not enough non biased testing to make it a sure choice . So far , all I see is a lot of sales pitches ... Mobil M 1-108 is shorter then M 1-110 ... . I was surprised to see how small the filter is .	1
I prefer to use Mobil 1 products , as they are recommended by Smart for their vehicles . It 's a huge benefit to see that Amazon sells them cheaper than I can find them anywhere else . Excellent product with great ratings !	1
This filter looked good ! ! So far I have nothing to complain about as I 've only had it installed for roughly 300 miles . The filter does go on smooth and because of the ribbed end cap you can hand twist this filter instead of having to use a tool to tighten the filter . On a 2003 Mazda Protoge5 there is very little real estate to maneuver . Thank you	1
As I do my own oil changes , I wanted to reduce amount of times I have to change oil by utilizing Synthetic Oil ( I go for fully synthetic Mobil1 or Pennzoil ) and I am able to accomplish it in conjunction with this filter . It was great , I never had any problems , and I get extra time now to do other tasks other than doing a yet another oil change .	1
Best filter you can get . I love these and wo n't use another brand . I actually had these with the Mobil 1 oil and did run to past 7500 miles with no issues .	1
These worked perfectly on my bikes undertail.Thanks . I was able to get my LED blinkers to blink at a normal speed and not that hyper blink speed that looks like youhad your 4 year old nephew install them .	1
I installed some LED bulbs for rear tail lights , and had the hyper flash problem . Of course this makes the LED use just as much energy as the stock bulbs , but the work normal . I do n't know if a LED burns out if they will tell you by hyper flashing does . They don.t install in line You must splice in to the positive with one wire and ground the other , which I did by using the screw mounts . They will get hot if used long so keep them Isolated . They have cooling fins and seem to be of good quality .	1
I installed an off-road bumper on my 2002 Tacoma , and with it I used LED turn signals . The turn signals flashed very quickly because the LEDs off different resistance than the stock bulbs . Install was quick utilizing the butt-split connectors . I attached the resisters to the truck with self-tapping screws which I provided , there was no hardware provided to attach them .	1
These resistors work very well and do stop the & # 34 ; hyperflashing & # 34 ; problem that occurs on some vehicles when LEDs are installed . However , if you are looking for something to take advantage of the low wattage and power savings of LEDs , these are not it . At 50w-60 Ohm , they are basically adding back the full load to the bulb thereby negating any drop in wattage and power consumption or load on the alternator . A better alternative would be a 1W-1000 Ohm insulated resistor which would create the same effect and maintain the low wattage draw of these LEDs . Now I just have to find them !	1
These were super easy to install and stopped the & # 34 ; Hyper Flashing & # 34 ; I got after installing LED Bulbs in my turn signal housing . Just make sure they stay away from any wires or plastic because they get pretty hot .	1
Pros : - They provided enough resistance to allow my turn signals to work with LED lights- Relatively inexpensive- Mountable- Come with wire connectorsCons : - The wires seem a little bit brittle- Cold weather seems to effect themI put LED bulbs in both the front and rear lights in my truck . The lack of resistance made it so that my brake lights did n't even work . I got the pair of these , and mounted them behind the rear taillights . They fixed my resistance issues , allowing both my turn signals and brake lights to work . The only problem , beside quality which is a little low , I have had with these is when they get cold . I find when it is about 50 degrees Fahrenheit out , they lose enough resistance that my turn signals do n't work . They do fix themselves once they warm up with electricity flowing through them though . This would probably happen with all resistors this cheap.Overall , they are a decent price and they get the job done .	1
This item is great for cars with incandescent brake lights . They are very high quality and should work fine to correct fast blinking light issues for normal cars.In my case I bought them for correcting fast blinking light issue on my Lotus Evora that happens after doing the popular DRL-disable hack , which involves disconnecting the main headlights from a relay circuit that controls the brake lights . The ECU is programmed to expect a certain load on the brake light circuit to determine whether or not the brake lights are out . This value includes a default load of used by the DRLs . By turning off disconnecting the DRLs from the brakelight circuit , the baseline has lowered and therefore the ECU thinks one of the bulbs ( front or rear ) have failed ( when they are actually not ) and increases the turn signal blink rate . ( The Evora has no independent turn signal lights , it uses the brake lights ) .Anyway , the fix is to mock the original load , thereby correcting the current levels back within the expected threshold.While these resistors will work in eliminating the fast blinking , the draw far too much amps than actually needed . Also , at drawing 2 amps of current they generate an amazing amount of heat , which would be okay on most cars with metal body work , but for the Evora , the delicate composite body and trim panels surrounding the heat sink can potentially warp under prolonged heating . Also , because the DRL circuit leaves the lights on while engine is not running , more battery power will be used up than before . Lastly the excessive 2A load would negate the car 's ability to actually detect a real bulb failure in the event it really happens.All that is needed is to simulate the original 3W bulb load at each brake light using a pair of 30 ohm 5W resistors . Each of those will only draw a miniscule 250mA.Anyway , I hope this helps .	1
I needed a little charger to maintain a motorcycle battery and this one works great . It 's automatic . It will will charge the battery and automatically switch over to maintain on it 's own without having to flip any switches manually . It can also detect whether the battery is a 6 volt or 12 volt and automatically change to charge and maintain either one . I also like the connections that were included with the charger . You can put a permanent pigtail on the terminals on your motorcycle and all you have to do is hook the charger to it without having to lift the seat or remove anything to hook up to the charger . It also includes the regular alligator clip type connections if you 'd rather use that type of connections . It was also very reasonable in price . Could n't ask for more for $ 19 bucks ! UPDATE : I 've been using this charger continuously now for almost 7 months and it 's still working great .	1
I write this review , looking back ... I am either SUPER happy with things like this ! orThey just S.U.C.K . 2 Star or Lower - Good product is not expensive ... This ranes true with the Schumacher brand , I have two other products that I have had for 35 years ... and they Still work perfectly ! I Especially like the charging wires than can switch between , Clips vs. Eyelets for a Permanent mount to my equipment . Then you only need extra Clips and then you can simply Plug in the Charger between batteries.I am going to add them to my Riding Mowers , ATV , and two Motorcycles ! Then in the Winter , just rotate the charger every week to a different machine ! A great product at entry level price ... My Battery Tender works great for my long term storage Cars , But I may have been just as well off with out the price difference ... I would rethink this if I were to do it all over again . Plus you can do 6 Volt and 12 Volt systems in one product and `` GEL-Cells '' too ... . Better Value with out a Cool BAG ! BatmanDSM	1
As another reviewer noted , this thing is dummy proof . I have multiple units keeping batteries charged in seasonal use vehicles & boats .	1
This thing works great and must be quite simple inside of the plastic housing as the first thing you will notice is how lite the charger is .The cords are long enough for pretty much any use and the plastic housing is smaller than the picture makes it seem . It is pretty much the size of a Kleenex box if anyone is wondering as this could be a selling point for some users but I have been using to charge power wheels batteries and it is working great . I would buy again if I need a second .	1
Super easy to use ! I use this to keep my 2008 Harley Electra Glide 's battery topped off . It comes with a quick-disconnect harness that allows you to quickly attach the charger .	1
Very easy to use . The only problem I find with it is the green & # 34 ; Charged & # 34 ; indicator light is a little weak in brightness and sometimes hard to see . About 1/3 the price of a Battery Tender and does all of the same things .	1
Bought this on a recommendation from a friend to use as helmet visor cleaner/polish . It works GREAT for this application , I just wish I could find the smaller can ... .	1
Found out about this product through amazon and it 's awesome . I use all types of waxes and spray detailers . If this was n't in a spray can it would be even better .	1
I will most certainly buy again , just have to run out first . This stuff is incredible at cleaning ANYTHING related with the motorcycle .	1
It cleans and polishes , no residue or streaking . It works well on any paint job leaving a high gloss finish which actually repels dirt . Highly recommend .	1
It works really well and I have used it for many years . I use it on the plastics on my motorcycle and cant say how well it works on chrome because I do not have any !	1
Just wiped down my Star V1300 with this stuff . Goes on easy and comes off easy . Leaves a real nice shine and is a breeze to use . It did not let it dry and just did one section of the bike at a time . Worked flawlessly . I will keep a can of this in my saddlebag . Used a micro fiber towl to wipe it down .	1
When I bought my new cruiser this past year , the dealer recomended this product . I have been using it ever since on all my bikes and I love it.Safe on plastics and vynal . Cleans and leaves a showroom shine .	1
This is works great . I use it on the mirrors , fairings , aluminum , black plastics , my gauge cluster , and on my polished frame . It gives a brilliant shine and gives the appearance that the bike was just washed . This reminds me ofGriot 's Garage 11066 Spray-On Car Wash - 1 Gallon . They both have the same smell and do almost the same thing . The only difference is the pro Honda spray is lighter and takes less effort to wipe off . The is a great product for keeping your bike nice and clean .	1
Do n't get me wrong , I like this kit , but and it would of been nice if it came with some kind of wipes or cloths to use with the cleaning solutions . If it came with wipes then it would be a & # 34 ; complete & # 34 ; kit . The box states it is a TRIAL size . These are to be used for touch-ups , they are not intended to be used to clean your entire vehicle . There is probably enough of each product to be used at least 10 or more times depending on how much of each product you use.I do n't see a use for this for my everyday vehicle , but it has come in handy for our street and hot rods . Our family has two antique muscle cars and 3 hot rods . A couple of the vehicles date back to 1930 . We are always going to car shows and exhibitions with them . These are the perfect size to keep underneath the seats hidden away from the public eye . If you have ever been to a classic car show , you know all the men stand around buffing their vehicle all high and mighty . It does not phase them that they are cleaning the same spot for 4 hours , but all that matters it looks shiny ! This kit has everything we need - all purpose cleaner to remove break dust from the rims , dashboard protector , carpet and upholstery , leather protector and window clear . The scents are wonderful , not too harsh or strong . I can not stand using Armor All because of the smell it leaves behind . However , these cleaners smell like a very light scented hand lotion or deodorizer . The window cleaner has no scent . I have attached a few pictures showing a couple of our classics cars with & # 34 ; notes & # 34 ; where the Eco Touch Care Care products were used.I would of given it a 5-star rating , but since it did not come with cleaning wipes or cloths I really do not consider this set to be a & # 34 ; trial & # 34 ; kit .	1
Has five components : leather cleaner , window cleaner , carpet cleaner , dash cleaner , and all-putpose cleaner . Convenient to get all in one package . Now to review the individual items : *all purpose -- works well on all surfaces . Cleans and shines nicely . *dash -- works well and as described . Also clean and shines well . *carpet -- easy to use , removed old stains , and has a nice scent . Kind of a citrus scent . *glass cleaner-you will need a microfiber cloth to use this . I got a little microfiber handheld squeegy/cleaner from a local Dollar store and that worked great . Cleaned just as advertised . Streak free . One of the nicest cleaners we have used on windows . *leather -- this was just average . Hard to dispense as it has to be poured . Did not like the smell AT ALL ! The cleaning was quite average ; Maguire works much better.So , overall , the four cleaners are a good value but the leather cleaner is something I will never use again .	1
Most eco friendly products seem to have some drawbacks , unpleasant smell or texture or being very expensive . These products seem to work very well on my `` new to me `` SUV . There is a great windshield cleaner that you can spray on to remove those huge bugs that seem to leave an impermeable deposit on the windshield . If I am getting gas and have a particularly nasty spot , I spray with this and it disappears along with the normal grime that you can get with the sponge and squeegee.It has a dashboard protector which I found handy because this vehicle came with scratches as if a small dog was trying to get to the windshield . The scratches disappeared with just a spray and a wipe . The kit includes an all purpose cleaner which I use in the car seat , an upholstery/carpet cleaner and `` surprise '' , a really good leather cleaner . As the owner of several saddles , I have been using leather cleaners for fifty years and this is good stuff . The seats look like new when I am done .	1
Eco Touch 's Car Care Kit Mini Pack is true to its name . It is a `` mini pack , '' more of a sampler than anything , that includes small ( 2 ounce ) bottles of various cleaning fluids . There 's the `` All Purpose '' fluid , another designed to clean the dashboard , another for the carpeting , etc . I thought each did its job well enough , and this mini-pack is perfect for anyone who wants to try it out before committing himself to a more expensive purchase .	1
Everything you need to give your road weary vehicle a spa treatment . Not only was the kit very handy , it contained products that did the job . I will say it is targeted to the higher end vehicle as it has a leather treatment . Not every car owner needs this . I might like to see a version that contains a treatment for fabric seats . I also think the inclusion of a couple microfiber cloths might be handy . That way , you could store it in your vehicle and have it ready for emergency spot cleaning .	1
This is n't really a kit , in that there are no cloths or wipes to use when applying the various cleaning agents ; rather it 's a collection of cleaning agents in sample sizes . That being said , it 's actually quite handy . I keep this in the boot of one of my cars , along with some paper and micro-fiber towels , for touch ups when I 'm away from my garage.The `` kit '' contains an all purpose cleaner , a glass cleaner , dashboard protectorant , carpet cleaner and a leather care product . They all work fairly well . The glass cleaner , in particular , does a nice job ; streak free with little effort . The leather care product , however , has a very offensive smell . Speaking of odors , most of the products are scented . I do n't care for that . I do n't want an artificial smell in my cars ; I prefer the smell of the natural leather.Overall a nice handy kit to tuck into the glove box or boot . Nothing earth shattering here in terms of performance ; the Griot 's or Mequiar products are as good or better , but it is compact and travels well .	1
All of the products work great . These are more of sample sizes , not full size . The leather cleaner worked well too but it smells terrible . I would n't buy the leather cleaner . The other products , I do recommend .	1
I must admit I 'm really impressed . The size is such that it fits neatly into the glove box . I get in the car all too often look at my dash , remember I need to clean it and forget it again . This set is great in that I can keep it in the glove box and clean it then and there.The sent of the dash cleaner is great . Not over whelming ( even when you get in the car after the car has set in the sun ) . Also it lacks the chemical smells of the leading products . Unlike other products the finish is a mat finish . For me this is great because if any accidently gets on the windows it is not a mess to clean off . I also feel like the glossy finishes show the dust more and even tend to attract dust or show finger prints / smudges.The leather product a little goes a long way and enhances the look of the leather without a slippery residue.The carpet spot cleaner is a must for me as a coffee drinker/spiller . In previous auto detailing packages I bought a carpet product was not included . The sent is good and does a great job at spot lifting.the window cleaner cleans without streaking and does not have the overwhelming scent that other window cleaners have . This lack of a chemical scent is essential for me when working in close places such as a car.What would make this kit even more effective would be an included cleaning cloth . Since it is not there I recommend consideringZwipes Microfiber 36-Pack of Cleaning Cloths . There are many more cloths than you would need for your car - however I have found them to be a good bulk value and I have had a set for over a year and they have worn really well .	1
I 'm always looking for products that are better for the environment and ones that have non-chemical scents . This is especially true in the summer when a car sometimes sits in the heat for hours and anything you use for cleaning can come back to haunt you with an overwhelming smell . I found this sampler kit of products to do a decent job of cleaning and the fragrances are pleasing and not too heavy.As the description states , these are 2 oz . sample sizes , which really goes a lot further than I thought at first . These are the different items in the kit along with their scent : '' All Purpose '' spray - Lemon-orange scent '' Window Clear '' spray - Unscented '' Dashboard Protect '' spray - Lavender '' Carpet & Upholstery '' spray -Orange-grapefruit scent '' Leather Care '' cream - Not certain what the scent is , but it 's nice ! None of the fragrances are overwhelming , so even if you used them at the same time , I do n't think your car would smell like a perfume counter . But I use them on different days because I like to smell each one . The handy 2 oz sizes would be great to take along on a trip . You know how easily a car 's interior can get trashed when you 're driving several hours a day . These are products that I enjoy using and will order the full size versions when these are empty .	1
I ca n't say this is the best product I have ever used for interiors . ( That belongs to products I have used from Zaino Brothers ) . But these are adequate , and do seem to be less harsh than typical cleaners.I did have a problem with the bottles . Weirdly , every bottle in my kit had a `` straw '' for the pump that was way too long . It actually curled from the bottom of the bottle so that it was unable to pump any fluid . Not just in one or two bottles , but all of them . Not a flaw of the product itself , but a bit annoying when I was trying it out.I did not think that the cleaners worked quite as good as others I have used , especially the leather cleaner . But they did not seem very harsh at all , and using a light brush ( I used a toothbrush ) yielded good results.Would I use these again ? Probably yes . Would I go out of my way to find them ? Probably not . But they do represent a good way to keep materials clean while helping protect your interior as well as helping the environment .	1
This package includes five different bottles of car cleaning products ; one each for leather , windows , dash , carpet/upholstery , and all purpose . One thing I noticed immediately was the pleasant smell . The dashboard cleaner works very well . It does n't leave a shiny look , and does a great job of actually cleaning and protecting . Same goes for the leather cleaner . I 've used the window cleaner the most , so I think this bottle probably needs to be a larger size or sold separately . I have n't used the all purpose bottle yet , but will try it on the wheels , as recommended by another reviewer . The small size of each bottle allows easy storage in the glove compartment or console for those quick touch-ups . Recommended .	1
I ca n't fail the company for referring to this car care kit as a 'mini pack ' but I would have preferred if they had labeled it a SAMPLE KIT . Each bottle is 2 oz and at the price I can understand . This mini kit will travel well in your glove compartment or underneath your kitchen sink . I still do not feel that it is enough liquid for our Nissan Armada 's needs . If you do not have any product at all then this is a good starting point to see which products you would want in a larger size.The kit includes : All Purpose cleaner , Dashboard Protector , Carpet and Upholstery cleaner , Leather Care cleaner and Streak-free Window Cleaner.The all purpose cleaner performed as it should as did the dashboard protector . We found the dashboard protector to not be oily to the touch as others have been in the past . The carpet and upholstery cleaner performed rather well on our dirty rugs considering they have n't been washed in two years . They smelt horrible before and after using a bit of the cleaner they have seen a new life for a bit longer . The leather cleaner stood out to ME because with my husband 's other cleaner I would slide off of my seat and jam into the dashboard each and every time . This is while being strapped in . With the Eco Touch cleaner I no longer slide off of the seat . The bad thing is that it STINKS ... . not pleasant at all . Our other cleaner with all of it 's sliding had a pleasant almond scent . Another big performer was the window cleaner . It did not streak one bit but you must use a Microfiber cloth . The exclusion of a cloth was a bit upsetting because you will not get the full potential of the glass cleaner without it.Highly recommend if you are in the market to try new products for the upkeep of your vehicle . Understand that they are tiny bottles and should be marketed as samples . I do believe they get away with that because it is convenient to have a wide array for all your car cleaning needs in a small package that is readily found in your glove . Recommend the leather cleaners performance but not the scent .	1
It definitely does n't clear it up perfectly but the chip is much less visible now . They give you quite a lot of the fluid but the entire kit is a single use item . A bit of a bummer really but it does what it says it does . Quite simple to use as well .	1
Fixed my windshield crack as expected . Almost as good as a Windshield repair service and a lot cheaper . Would recommend to anyone . Follow the instructions very carefully and you will get a good result .	1
Had a stone that deflected off the windshield and chipped the glass . If left untreated , the crack would grow and the windshield would have to be replaced . Make sure to follow the directions very carefully . Even being meticulous , I had to actually do it 2x , as the adhesive did not penetrate well on the first effort . Second time around - the adhesive finally sealed all the cracks and the windshield had held up .	1
The kit itself is easy enough to use , the instructions are clear but I 've only had luck repairing tiny star cracks . Repair of small star cracks makes them nearly invisible but anything longer than 1/2 inch does n't get filled well . Repair of longer ( more than 1/2 inch ) may stop the crack from spreading but does nothing to conseal it so the crack is still very visibe.Bottom line - do n't procrastinate and use this product before the crack spreads . If you do that , this product should work well .	1
I read the directions and also watched the & # 34 ; how to & # 34 ; video on Youtube . It was very easy to apply and it worked great . Yes , I can still see a little of the rock chip , but I 'm confident it will not crack .	1
Instructions were fine and it was easy enough to do . I had to do it twice though to get acceptable results . Good thing there was enough solution to do it multiple times.Posting this a few months after using it , and the windshield is still holding up fine .	1
It worked but it 's only one time use . Fixed a small spider crack I had in my speed3 . Looks a lot better .	1
Well my headlights were a gross greenish cloudy hazed color . Used this kit and they literally almost look brand new . Now all I use when washing my car is PlastX to give them a nice shine , and have not had any issues or cloudiness comeback .	1
Cool product . I used this kit to restore a yellow headlight on a 2001 Nissan Sentra and a 2003 Ford F150 . It takes some time and you do n't want to rush the process ; but they looked good when I was done . Saved me about $ 200.00 from a dealer .	1
Do what the instructions say and you will get what you expected . The headlights look like `` new '' . Be sure to take your time and get a stool ( or bucket ) to sit on . Bending over to polish the lights makes your back tired and causes you to hurry !	1
Worked great on my oxidized headlight . I should 've recharged my drill before doing the second headlight , however . But the results are amazing !	1
If you want like-new headlights , order this . So simple and easy to use -- it could n't be more clear and simple . Remember , you do need a high-rpm house drill for this kit , or this wo n't work for you.By the way , this is my second kit , for what it 's worth .	1
I 've bought Craftsman 's C3 XCP wireless drill ( max 1600RPM ) and tried this kit . This kit worked very well and my cloudy lens is restored to crystal clear . Note , however , that some swirl marks are still left is you look closer . Also , if you are not careful , you can strip the bumper paint as the masking tape can easily be torn.If you 're not confident enough to use drill , let someone with skills or a shop do it for you as you can cause damage .	1
i was blowned away after using the 3M 39045 Headlight Renewal with Protect-ant kit as the finished product was amazing . That was 2 months ago and the buff still holds . Highly recommended .	1
If your headlights are yellowed , fogged , or opaque from sun damage , you 're not seeing as well at night as you could be . There 's a ton of kits out there to refinish headlights , and they all work the same way , by sanding off the damaged layer , and polishing the plastic underneath to a smooth surface.The bonus here is the protectant , which helps prevent the yellowing and oxidation from coming back . You do need to apply it often , once a month or so , to keep protection in place , but a good car wax will work once you run out of the packet.3M has frequent rebates on these products , so keep an eye out and give one a try . It 's a small price to pay for safety on the road .	1
I used a single kit on the headlights of my 1998 Chrysler Town and Country and my 1996 Ford F150 . The result for both vehicles was amazing . The polishing sequence of the pads in the kit transformed my lenses from so opaque the bulbs were n't visible to nearly new looking . The increased nighttime visibility was truly impressive . I would not hesitate to use this product again . I ca n't imagine a better DIY solution to tired headlight lenses - and it keeps stuff out of landfills by eliminating the need for replacements .	1
This works better than the other brand I used before . All the renewals seem to do a good job , but reoxidize w/i 6 months . After this last time , I bought kevlar headlight adhesive sheets- $ 30 on Amazon . These are available cut specifically to the size of headlights and driving lights of auto .	1
I purchased this product to restore my headlights and it did a great job . Cheaper here than at the auto store and identical product . Follow the directions or watch the video and you will be impressed .	1
Follow the instructions and your back to seeing a bright road ahead at night . They have put together the perfect combination of grit and liquid to do the job . Just keep in mind that once the factory coating has deteriorated to the point you need this lit the damage is done and you will have to redo the light regularly ( Yearly ) until they need replacing . I believe the Headlight are the eyes of the car the clearer they are the newer the car looks .	1
I get about 18 months out of these , they do work . I 've had my headlights professionally done and used the 3M . This works as well as professional $ 50 job .	1
This is a nice product and did exactly as I expected it would . My lights went from yellow and dull to crystal clear . However I did not expect that it would take as much effort as it did . The light has to be sanded three different times with three different grades of sandpaper and then an additional once over with a fine sanding cream.Like I said my expectations were that it would be very quick and easy and maybe I had unrealistic expectations . The reality is it is fairly easy but takes closer to an hour to do properly . I would certainly use this product again and I would recommend it .	1
I used this kit to do the badly damaged lenses on a motorhome . There is enough for probably 2 more sets . It took about an hour . This is a nicely made kit of everything you need to make the worst lenses look great . You will need a drill.The things that you must remember.The drill needs to be around 1600 rpm . Less and it may take a long time . A corded one may be the best.This is not for the merely discolored but not scratched . For those an oxidation remover is better . This is for the ones where the hard coating is damaged and scratched.This will remove any UV barrier left and you can expect UV discoloration and scratching to begin showing up again in 3 months with all of these kits . The included UV protection wo n't do much to stop it . I suggest getting either a spray on UV cured hard coating or a aftermarket protection sheet coating to protect them . ( Amazon sells them ) . In my case that added $ 40 to the cost of the job but replacement lights would be $ 500 for the pair ! . I expect this to last for 1-3 years before needing the scratch covering replaced .	1
Nice system . the Drill bonnet inside the kit makes the job easier . I would highly recommend a drill system . OTW , it will take twice the time and effort . It does not get your plastic on the headlight back to 100 % . I would say , 85-90 % . But , noticeably improved , whiter and clearer than before . The first system lasted about 2 years without the lens UV protection application . So , this time , did it with a final UV application . It was more like a wax finish as opposed to a clear coat finish I was expecting . Nevertheless , I will see if will last longer with a final UV coat .	1
The instructions are very helpful and easy to use . This is a good product and lives up top the 3M name .	1
Maybe since I park my car inside my headlights were n't too bad , but they were getting a tiny bit frosted so I decided to head it off at the pass . The first step with the gold sanding pad is the key to a successful outcome . You have to sand off everything you want to get rid of in this step because the remaining steps are just to minimize then buff out those scratches . I should have been more aggressive with the first ( gold ) step , but I was scared of doing something I could n't undo . When you start sanding and your headlight gets frosted you think that it will never be right again . Trust me , spend some time with that first step and use all of your sanding discs to get rid of all of the haze and pits . Then , follow the remaining steps per the directions and your headlights will be beautiful again . Use this kit when you have some time to dedicate to it . Pull up a chair and allow yourself at least an hour so you can slowly and thoroughly perform each step .	1
I was able to bring back the headlights from my wife 's 2003 Corolla . Almost brought them back to new . It does take some time depending on how bad the headlights are . It took me 1 hour each headlight but the headlights where very hazy .	1
The lights are easy to see in daytime . They seem to be well made . If anyone rear-ends my trailer it will be because they are blind .	1
This led light is excellent . Easy to install . I replaced the original lights in my trailer , and these lights are twice as bright .	1
Converting my old tandem trailer to led . They have the same standard plug as all ovals , fit perfect , and have been running for a year with no issues	1
Replaced some original `` light bulb '' type of lights on a boat trailer with these LED 's . Very low cost , and installation was very easy . Just get something under the round black grommet , start to pull , and it will come out of frame . Just connect the wiring , and slide the new one with new grommet into the frame . The light is held in place and `` suspended '' by the grommet . I have not put the trailer into the water yet , but the lights look fine , and are reasonable bright .	1
I love this wax ! It gave my car a great shine and it protects my paint from any harsh contaminates .	1
The liquid wax goes on easily and , after wiping with the microfiber cleaning cloth provided , leaves a nice clear shine . For me it 's all about ease of use , quality , and results . Meguiar 's delivers !	1
I love this new wax by Meguiar 's . I applied this to my clayed and polished car , so just note that . It is VERY HARD to see when you apply this to your car ( I have dark blue paint ) . It is basically clear even under my garage lights . This might make you put on more wax than is needed . After awhile , you get the hang of it though . I put this on a quarter of my car at a time , waited 4 minutes , then buffed off . After this was , my car was incredibly shiny and had rich color . This also repelled the dust and water that seems to get on my car every morning .	1
its an excellent wax , easy on and off , it leaves sometimes black streaks on my black car , but i learned how to do it properly the second time , is to go 1/2 panel maximum and wax off immedietly , this way i had no streaks , ok on plastic mirrors and trim , very easy to apply than paste waxes , in the commercial on you tube meguiars claim you can wax the whole car and then wax off , , i dont think so , again 1/2 a panel each time and then moving to the next is the most ideal way , for example the hood of the coupe is long , so i devided it to four sections , t , he door devided to 2 sections and so on , at the end excellent product .	1
I used this to wax my Jeep and it worked really well . It was very simple to apply and remove ( even in direct sunlight ) , and left a nice rich shine on the paint . I 'll definitely buy this product again .	1
This liquid wax is very easy to apply and even easier to remove . It is not like paste wax that usually takes a lot of effort to remove . It leaves a nice shine and I expect it to last about 3-4 months . I normally renew wax every 3 months anyway , so it works out good for me .	1
I would not buy this product again . It does what it should but If I had to do it again I would just stick with detaling microfiber towels from Viking/Cobra .	-1
Bought this for my spare tire on my utility trailer . Very inexpensive ( cheap ) , flimsy and loose fitting . Seems like it can be broken off easily . Will probably end up getting a cable lock . This device does n't really give me a sense of security . I suppose for only five bucks you get what you pay for .	-1
The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous . The funnel is 10 '' long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6 '' long . It states that the funnel is 4 '' x 4 '' but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4 '' in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless .	-1
I am using this on a Curt receiver and the length is perfect . It appears to be of high quality construction ( with a bit if weight to it ) and this design prevents any rattling on bumpy roads . My only complaint is that it gets rust buildup inside the lock mechanism after a few months , so you need to clean it periodically.Update : A great deal of dirt has found its way into the lock mechanism so I guess the fit is not secure like it should be . Also it is now rusting which I find a bit odd in all stainless construction . I see the head design has changed based on the new picture here so maybe the issue is fixed now .	-1
I am a car RV detail guy . My car and RV must be shining new all the time . I thought I had found the best shine wax protection using an rv wax called protect-all with UV inhibitors in it prior to trying this Flagship wax and used it for years and it did the job and nothing else on the market ( so I thought ) was going to top it for fiberglass . I use McGuires Fiberglass restorer and that did the most amazing removal of oxidation on an older RV I restored back to new so I knew it had to be good and tried it.I ADDED REVISED REVIEW TO END OF ORIGINAL REVIEW ON THIS PAGE ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .Well after applying this Flagship wax to my already clean and shiny RV it took the shine to a whole higher level . 1st off it does go on easy , once on its stays kind of moist like but drys SOFT LIKE but it comes off nice , then I follow with 2nd dry cloth to make sure its completly off and shiny and it does come off easy and it does clean finish up leaving a nice shiny glazed surface . But you need to change up rags often because it cakes and smears if you dont.I read reviews on Amazon which enticed me to give it a try . One said dont let dry any longer then 3 min and bottle claims same ( This is very true I am so pleased at results.The biggest improvment was the nice gold painted bottom of the Motorhome where the paint looked good before but now the paint looks glazed , shiny , and rich like I never was able to get this high a shine before . It also does not cling to plastic , windows or rubber everything it touches it comes off of leaving a high shine on it , So I used it on everything.NOW THIS IS MY REVISED REVIEW AS OF AUGUST 2013 . AFTER USING THIS AND LIKING IT AT 1ST ... I FOUND IT WILL CONTINUE TO BEAD BUT WATER STREAKS SEEM TO STICK AND STAY ON WAXED SURFACE ON FIBERGLASS EVEN WASHING WONT REMOVE THEM EASY . SO I WENT BACK TO USING PROTECT-ALL ON MY RV . IT SHINES AS WELL BUT ALSO THE WATER STREAKS ARE MINIMAL AFTER A RAIN AND WASH OFF EASIER.I also find the protect-all brand wax to last long and come off cleaner after applying wax leaving a cleaner shine.Making it far easier to do a big RV in less time then Flagship wax . I FOUND fLAGSHIP TO BE CAKY THICK AND HARDER TO REMOVE AND HAVING TO CONSTANTLY GET FRESH RAGS TO MAKE IT EASY TO GET OFF ... ... ... So we tried it- liked it at first but then a week or so later found the flagship to not be as good as what I used for years in the Protect-all brand . I LOVE McGUIRES PRODUCTS MOST TIMES .	-1
I used this for a while . Though hollow plastic I felt it was designed to hold a camper from rolling and it did . One day I forgot to remove it when pulling out and it seems to take very little pressure moving forward to flatten it like a pan cake so I though my 50,000 investment may be better served with a heavy duty galvanized wheel chock that wont give in and even let me move over it by mistake and let me know its holding solid if I ever did again roll forward over it .	-1
Only fair . NOT very durable and do NOT fully secure the trailer . Spend the extra $ $ $ and get the X-Block and / or the Fastaway ( we now use both , Fastway for intiial set and the x block for final lock in )	-1
The & # 34 ; feet & # 34 ; on this bar slides off the truck bed sides and makes it worthless.When the ratchet is extended , the mechanism for that ends up out of arms reach when standing outside the truck .	-1
Bit of a let down here . From all the reviews , I thought maybe my search for the perfect nozzle would come to an end . It did n't . The sequencing of spray patterns on this nozzle is not what you are used to . Sure , it has a unique ability to produce a fine spray and a fire hose kind of effect , but when switching between patterns it passes mostly through various streams of concentrated water that dench anything in its way . If you are trying not to splatter mud , create craters or wash away feshly planted seeds , this is not your nozzle . Maybe it makes more sense on cars .	-1
You are better off going to your local department store and buying the Craftsman brand nozzle instead . It is identical to this one except the green part is silver . And it comes with a lifetime replacement guarantee unlike this Bon-Aire one . It 's also about the same price.That said , I prefer a trigger type nozzle because to turn this off , you have to rotate it several revolutions and then it does n't remember the spray setting you were at . This type of nozzle may be good if you 're holding it for a long period of time watering your garden or something like that , but for washing your car when you only turn the water on periodically , it does n't work as well as a trigger type hose nozzle .	-1
When looking at these products , simply calculate the actual cost per square foot . for example this '' speaker kit '' contains 1.38 square feet , for around 22 bucks ( price fluxuates like its a stock or something ? ) can u think of anything thats worth 15 dollars a square foot ? there are so many cheaper alternatives . dynamat is an awsome product , and it does work . but for those of us not made of money , search this `` butyl flashing tape '' u will be glad u did .	-1
I returned because it is just too much work to install and I find it hard to believe they would make much difference .	-1
Does not make a noticable enough difference in sound quality to justify it 's cost . I installed it inside of my doors using the roller and lots of elbow grease . All parts of the dynamat that I installed have good contact with the metal . I would return this but it is stuck to my car door ...	-1
You 'd better trust your Jack Stands if you have any intention of getting under your car.I thought these were a good option but I changed my mind after receiving them ... For whatever reason , justified or not , I felt uneasy seeing how much they rattle.I decided to take my car to the mechanics and ended up never using them . I forgot to return them and then it was too late ... So two stars because they do not inspire me any confidence .	-1
the first time I used it out of the box , one stand 's neck is broken . I decided this brand is the one I should avoid . And let my friend know it .	-1
BAD PRODUCT , WRONG WELDED , ITS ONLY WELD INSIDE , BUT NOT OUT SIDE , SO IS NOT RECOMENDED TO USE IT UNDER CAR . PLEASE DONT MAKE MY MISTAKE , IS NOT WELD RIGHT.THIS ITEM HAVE TO BE WELD IN BOTH SIDE , INSIDE AND OUT SITE , NOT ONLY INSIDE.THE PIN OR SECOND SAFETY PIN IS NOT GOOD AT ALL , IT MOVE AND DOES NOT HOLD THE POST RIGHT , ITS LIKE NOTHING , SO DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE IT. -- - TORIN WANTS TO SEND IT BACK EVERY YEAR FOR ANNUAL INSPECTION , BUT THEY DONT PAY FOR S/H . THIS SHOUL BE 1 TON , NOT 3 TON WITH THIS WELD FORM.MY ITEM LOOK USED NOT NEW , LOOK 'S LIKE SOME ONE USE IT AND RETURNED AND THEN , THEY SENT THEM TO ME . THE UPS DROP IT TO THE FLOOR , CAUSE I HAVE A GATE , SO BE AWARE OF UPS , THEY DONT CARE IF THEY BRAKE IT .	-1
Fram has a horrific history of manufacturing oil filters that fail . Their filters leak and do a poor job at filtering impurities . There are websites devoted to discussing oil and oil filters and Fram products are nearly universally criticized and avoided . There are also videos online that investigate Fram oil filters and they are nearly all universally negative.Purolator , Wix ( NAPA ) , Mann , Mahle , are some quality filters . Fram are the worst filters and you are risking harming your bike .	-1
This device attaches securely to the tow vehicle , but at a cost.They are cumbersome to attach and detach , with several moving parts and the potential to scratch the tow vehicle paint during either process if you do n't have three hands available.To attain the secure vibration free fit , you must crank down on the ratcheted web strap hard enough to deform the door where it attaches to the window channel . It also deforms the rubber window seal.Foam pads protect the door somewhat where the bracket would otherwise rub on the body , but if the area is n't meticulously clean beforehand I can see where it would dull the paint over time.Because of the metal claw part that fits into the window channel , raising and lowering the window caused a screeching sound on my driver 's side window.Finally , when they are detached from the door , they make for a very bulky awkward device that does n't store conveniently or compactly in the vehicle.I 'm sending them back .	-1
This is a piece of junk. ! The straps stretch , the plastic clips slip off while tightening , and the dam things fall off while driving . Try to get the type that slide over the existing mirror and have a plastic screw in the back to hold it on . They do work well .	-1
1 . The viewing surface of the 8 inch mirror is exactly 7.5 inches wide and 2.25 inches high.2 . I tried adjustment of the mirror without mounting it . The ball joints on the mirror arm are so tight that adjusting is extremely difficult to nearly impossible . WD40 did not work , neither did working the joints around to loosen them up.3 . So if you try to adjust the mirror after it 's mounted , you risk stressing the mounting button glue and the button may fall off.4 . When adjusting the mirror , the day/night button kept flipping on/off . Very annoying.5 . The mirror surface itself is very good , no ripples .	-1
I gave these things a 2 star rating because we have 8 sets of them installed on our county patrol cars . Not sure what the issue is but the bulbs are burning out at a pretty often rate . I just had one officer tell me both his lights burnt out last night , 01/23.2014 . Maybe the 130 watt bulb is just getting too hot but we have lost about 8 to 10 bulbs within a years time . Hope KC reads this and can do something about that issue . Other than that , they are a great , powerful light that reaches out so you can see those darn deer ahead of you . Be safe and maybe look for another type of light that will give you longer service life before you spend the money on these .	-1
I used it on decent-looking leather seats of a 2003 Toyota Sienna.I bought both the cleaner and the conditioner and used them as described . Even if they did what they are supposed to do , I did not realize that . It has not made a difference appearance-wise.Hopefully the treatment will help keep them alive longer . Do I regret buying them ? No . I do not .	-1
I got this Lexol Leather pH Cleaner Spray offline at a local auto parts store ... and I am glad I did.I start cleaning my car and the first thing I notice is the citrus smell . Suddenly half through cleaning the passenger front seat the sprayer broke . At this point the white cleaning rag I was using was still white and given I had not cleaned the seats in months I just returned it.So I went online and after much research orderedGriot 's Garage 11259 Leather Care Spray Kit . Well , the Griot cleaner cleaned old grime of the leather seats I had cleaned with the Lexol cleaner a week earlier.I have used a variety of leather cleaners over the years and in my experience this one does absolutely nothing .	-1
I used both the cleaner and the conditioner as described but they did not make a difference on decent looking leather seats in my 2003 Sienna . If they made a difference I have not realized it.I do not regret buying these , I hope they will add to the life of the leather seats even though I have not observed a change in appearance .	-1
THE JACK STANDS FELL WITH NOTHING ON THEM WHEN I BARELY SHOOK THEM . MADE IN CHINA JUNK . WASTE OF TIME . IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE BUY AMERICAN JACK STANDS .	-1
I ordered and paid for next day air because I needed it this weekend . It arrived , but it was n't what I ordered . I ordered a pair of jack stands . I received an engine hoist leveler.I understand mistakes happen.. but it was the way the return has been handled that I have issues with . UPS dropped it off , but I have to take it to the post office to send it back ? And I was n't told if they 'll wait to ship the right order until they receive this back via the slowest mail service.. so I have no idea when the replacement order will arrive . A week ? Two weeks ? This was n't my mistake or even a defective product.. this was human error on their part . They should have told me they 'd IMMEDIATELY ship the replacements next day like I ordered . So far I 'm left hanging . Should I go out locally and get what I need and then end up with an extra set ? Should I hold off a day because they 're coming next day ? I do n't know.. and that 's the point and that 's why I gave them one star .	-1
I used this on my pickup truck because I had been getting some hard starts and rough idles and decreased fuel economy . For about the past 6 months , I have noticed about a 2mpg drop in fuel economy.A couple of my friends have used this stuff and claimed success , so I gave it a shot . I added a can to the fuel tank , and half a can each to the crankcase and air intake . Let it sit and drove it around . It smoked like crazy as promised.Now , anecdotally , I do think it smoothed out my idle and I have n't had a hard start . But , there is nothing I can quantify , and I am not sure that the improvements are not all psychological . I think my truck runs better if I wax it . My use also coincided with the end of winter , so the operating temperatures can account for the improvements , too . I did not see an improvement in mpg.So , if this is where my story ended , I 'd say give it a go . If it works , great . If not , you did n't lose too much.BUT ... The second tank after using this I got a o2 sensor code and had to replace a downstream sensor . To be fair , the truck has 100k , and this could just be the natural lifespan of the sensor . Since I had already noticed a drop in mpg , the sensor was likely on its way out . At the same time , I think it is rather interesting that it failed less than 300 miles after using this product when I 've been driving around with the diminished mpg for several thousand miles . My personal belief is that the big blast of smoke just pushed a failing sensor over the edge.So , no , I wo n't use this stuff again . Most people have had fine luck , but its not worth the risk for me .	-1
I have used both cans of this product on different cars . The product results in a tremendous amount of emissions being spewed into the air when sucked into the vacuum system as described in the articles I read about the product before purchasing it . In addition to creating air pollution and drawing angry stares from neighbors , I am simply not convinced the product is effective .	-1
I used this for years on my car dash and other vinyl areas of the interior . I always thought it worked and protected pretty well although it does evaporate on to the inside of the windshield , which is annoying . It also does n't seem to last very long and as it starts wearing off , the dash looks very dry.I 've since found303 Aerospace Protectant 32oz , and that works much better . It does n't seem to exhibit any of the aforementioned issues , ie. , it does n't seem to go on to the inside of the windshield , and the shine lasts longer . It also protects from UV just as well , if not better . Note that Vinylex contains silicone , which actually damages the vinyl/plastic over time.I 'm definitely sold on 303 Protectant over Vinylex now although I really like the Lexol pH leather cleaner and Lexol leather conditioner for my leather .	-1
This thing leaks on first use . The hoses are not tight and the brake fluids leak everywhere under my hood . Lucky I put 3 towels around the brake fluid tank because I knew this would happen . Will not buy this again .	-1
There is no swiveling between the cap , the tube and the bottle . In other words , when you screw/unscrew the cap onto the car 's brake fluid container , there will be kinking on the tube itself . Untangling the kinks is a chore because the bottle is both quite big and heavy when it is filled with brake fluid . They should have designed with some quick-connect/disconnect like the compressor air hose . That would be an ideal solution , but I guess it will add to the cost for adding that feature . However , I doubt that it would cost much because I browsed through the air-hose connectors at Harbor Freight and they run typically a couple of bucks each . I might modify this bleeder with the air hose connector to address the problem .	-1
The quality of the Bleeder is awesome , however it will take hours upon hours if you plan on actually using this product to bleed your car 's brake fluid . You are far better off either using a buddy to pump the brakes and you open the bleeder valve and then press the brakes in 5-10 times , and then closing the bleeder valve and repeat as necessary . You get a higher amount of fluid out each time than using this bleeder . After squeezing the top on it managed to keep 14 PSI ( 14.5 Recommended for by VW mechanics manual ) , which literally pushed out 10 drops every minute.If you are n't too sure how to bleed brakes as I stated above , just go on youtube and you 'll see what I am talking about.Also the bleeder bottle you can find on amazon as an item frequently bought with this item is worth the money .	-1
These test leads were way too wimpy for automotive use . Ifter a couple of them pulled apart then I just threw the rest of them out . Low grade product .	-1
CHEEP	-1
yes , they are wire leads with alligator clips , so if that 's your only standard for giving them a good rating ... otherwise , trying to use these as jumper wires in electrical work is useless since they have so much resistance due to the very small gauge wire and shoddy connections . they make good clips for hanging paper , lol	-1
These things give off a pretty wide pattern for being so small . they could be a tad bit brighter but they are a fog light which is exactly what i needed . Lights feel well made and sturdy . The wiring harness is very well made . Wire is of good quality and is fairly long however , the load wire that goes from the switch to the relay was not long enough and needed to be extended for my needs . The switch that comes with the kit is really nice and has an LED active light thats red when the lights are off and greeen when the lights are turned on , but i wont be using it.EDIT : CRAP ! lights started to leak . seems like the weather stripping inside around the lens is way too big and doesnt seal right . took the lights off my front bumper and put them on my rear bumper to use as reverse lights since they didnt give me the light output desired . after almost of week of being on my rear bumper they filled up completely with water even worse than they did on my front bumper and one lens also cracked . going to contact the company or seller to see if i can get a replacement lens . READ ALL REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING . THESE LIGHTS ARE NOT THE GREATEST .	-1
I mounted these on the bumper of my Ford F250 . They are about 24 '' off the ground ; not too close to the pavement by any means . The housings started to leak within a week or two of being installed . I removed the lights and tried sealing with black silicone , but they still leaked . Perhaps because of the leak , the chrome started flaking off within a few weeks . I now have very good looking lights , which leak , produce nearly no helpful light , and wo n't stay aimed in the direction I angled them .	-1
These things are burning our right and left . We have these installed in 8 of our patrol cars and they do n't seem to last more than a few months . Be careful if you order the KC lights with the 130 watt bulbs . The light reaches out as good as any I 've ever seen but the quality of the bulb leave much to be desired	-1
Very well constructed but it has a design flaw that makes it useless . The internal plunger has a disc with a slot and the T handle needs to engage the disc perfectly or the rod pushes into the grease and not the disc so the grease does not load properly . I have 4 other standard grease guns and these work perfectly but I wanted the pistol grip so I could pump with one hand.I have not idea what the intended purpose is in having the rod disengage from the plunger disc as this is unique in my experience to the Lincoln grease gun .	-1
Hard to apply and very hard to take off . This will go in the back of the supply cabinet and only be useed when I am out of P21S . You definitely get what you pay for in this case .	-1
Maybe its just me , but I did n't see much difference . I have a 2010 370Z that I baby , and decided after three years it might be time to detail the finish . As I said , I baby the darn thing so its garage kept and pretty clean to start with . I followed the long , involved instructions written by one of the experienced reviewers to the letter . I decided to just do the hood , and then clean/wax the rest of the car for comparison . . I could see some different in the hood . It was definitely a higher gloss . But not a difference that any one else would notice . Maybe it would be more noticeable in an older car with faded paint . But I would n't waste time doing this again .	-1
This is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat 4 wire connector . Not only did my connector fit loose and tilt at an angle as a result , but the holder did not have a proper channel to fit the cover for the 4 wire connector I just bought . The channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific . This was a waste of money . I had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place .	-1
I 'm not shocked that there were no wires , even though the picture shows wires . But I am surprised that the dust cover - which appears to be integral in the picture - is not included . All that 's in the package is the clamp itself and some self-drilling sheetmetal screws . Maybe I 'll check back some day and see that the picture has been changed or the description has been updated to reflect reality , in which case I 'll change the number of stars . But for now , I 'm knocking two stars off for the deceptive ad , and another star for the product really being a fairly cheap piece . In my opinion , the piece is n't a great value ; the price is at best only `` fair '' . And yeah , I know , we 're not reviewing prices . But it 's a cheaply-made product which lacks finish ; I think the bottom side could 've been solid instead of having the exposed ribbing , and I think the included screws ( which appear to at least be stainless ) should 've come with appropriately-sized washers to distribute the load on the plastic .	-1
I bought this because Amazon suggested that it should be bought along with the brake controller . There is no need for it at all as the brake controller mounted just fine with the included hardware .	-1
Not sure why , but my this adapter doesnt light up to do the checks as it is suppose to . I think it is my suv ( Audi ) that doesnt support just the leds to verify operation . I kept it anyway as it works fine with the trailer and all the lights work .	-1
I got these to use on my leather clothes and car seat . Very cheaply made . The white lint from the pad comes off and is a mess to pick up from leather clothes and car seat . Go to dollar store and get microfiber cloth !	-1
I used this product on the rear of my disc brake calibers and it was a big wasted of time.Did not push in the piston.I had to use a 6in . C-CLAMP which worked out pretty well.Lisle Disc Brake Pad Spreader LIS-24400	-1
The tool worked great on the first set of pads . Went to do the other side and the threaded rod broke loose from the knob . NOT recommended .	-1
I 'm bucking the trend of favorable reviews here.I do give it two stars because it does go on easy , smells decent , and has excellent cleaning capability . The towel came out more black than with other products , which I assume indicates it is removing a lot of oxidized black rubber/trim.Unfortunately , this product does NOT last . I covered all the rubber/plastic on my car ( two thorough coats ) , let it soak in/settle for a day , then washed it to get the overwipe/streaks of nearby body panels , etc . The Meguiar 's # 40 washed completely off . It was left worse than before I used the product . The finish remaining was also very splotchy and looks bad . Even some interior parts that I applied # 40 to were mostly wiped clean after just wiping with a damp towel used to pick up accumulated dust/dirt . It remained splotchy where there were minor nicks scratches in the plastic/rubber where more # 40 had absorbed.Overall , I was very unsatisfied with the results . I 'm not going to say it is the worst product I have ever used , but others that I use are far and away better . These include 303 Aerospace Protectant which is a very mild , water-based product which also does n't last but is better than this Meguiars product and has almost no sheen.My previous staple and which I recommend most is actually Armor All Original . I purchased a Guru Reports analysis on these types of products several years ago and was surprised that this `` old '' product was one of the two best-in-category products ( along with Zaino ) among over 50 that were tested . Armor All Original ( not other formulations ) is very low sheen and also lasts several washes . It is also about 1/4 the price or less and available everywhere.I 'm going back to Armor All Original and recommend that you try it as it performs better than `` boutique '' products . I would also recommend that you use water-based products on permanent trim , rubber , etc. , as the solvent/petroleum-based ones have a tendency to degrade the rubber/plastic over time . These may be OK for replaceable items like tires or parts that are severely oxidized . You can generally tell the difference in that water-based products are milky color while the petroleum-based ones are clear . I do like Meguiar 's Hot Shine for severe problems , but not this product .	-1
dont buy this product , I bought it for my 2010 toyota corolla because you need a special tool for the oil filter housing , the put where you insert the wrench into broke on the first turn , waste of money . at least amazon let me return it broken .	-1
3 things. # 1 Spring is cheep and installed incorrectly . Snapped on unpacking so i had to twist it to place it the right ( better ) way and twist the ends toward inside more , because spring is made of cheep metal that bends like aluminum. # 2 Size is too big for regular car filters . Toyotas/Hondas/Motorcycles ETC . Maybe a 5Lite For 3500 utility van will have enough filter diameter for this to fit around , or a huge SUV or a pickup truck. # 3 Removal only . does not work the other way around to tight the filter .	-1
I had this thing for a few months and it worked really well for taking off oil filters . It only made it through like 3 or 4 filters until the spring broke though . I do n't recommend buying it .	-1
I think this was my fault for not reading every line of the description before buying . I saw words like wide range and universal and biting teeth ... What I missed was that it works from 3 1/8 to 3 7/8 inches ... I am sure I 'll use it , just not as much use as I 'd hoped it would get .	-1
When I first got it , the wrench did work , however , it was never that easy to use due to needing to be flared out first to fit over the filter . At some point , I lost the spring ( not sure why it could even detatch ) and then it was rendered completely useless . Ended up buying a couple of the large socket looking ones that come in three sizes to fit common filters . They 're a bit cheaper , but I had to buy multiple so they end up costing more . But , they also work , easily , every time .	-1
Tool feels sturdy and like it would help , but ended up being a useless tool in the arsenal . I would n't recommend this since you can hand tighten the oil filter if you used a textured one like the purolator .	-1
I 've used my Mityvac 7201 less than 10 times . I have treated it very carefully , as I do all my stuff . But still , it works poorly for me.The selector valve that you use to switch between evacuating/dispensing is ridiculously difficult to operate . I ca n't just push or lift my selector valve to operate it . No , I have to twist it while pushing/pulling like a madman , and hope I do n't break anything ( including my fingers ) . I was able to loosen it up somewhat by spraying the valve with silicone/Teflon spray , and operating it repeatedly . But ( 1 ) It 's still not easy to operate , and ( 2 ) I should n't have to do that.The expandable plug that must be expanded to evacuate/dispense or removed to pour fluid out is ridiculously difficult to remove . It 's just a poor-fitting device.The tube connector where the main evacuation tube enters the top of the unit leaked when I put it in dispense mode . I had to pay over $ 27 to get a replacement `` Tube Connector Kit '' ( 822566 ) , since my unit is out of warranty.After replacing the tube connector and trying dispense mode again , I found that the top plate leaks . I had not noticed this before , but it explains why it always took so much pumping when I evacuated oil ! When I use it in dispense mode now , the main tube does n't leak anymore , but air and oil come out from under the top plate . I removed the top plate , and sure enough , `` Look Ma , no seal ! '' It would be bad enough if the seal had merely failed , but for the seal not to be included in the first place is inexcusable . Because I did n't notice this problem sooner , the seal ( 822821 ) is costing me an additional $ 13 , including a ridiculous $ 8.75 fee for shipping.Now I 've added ( not replaced -- added ) the top seal , and while doing a test , I can hear that the unit leaks air at the top of the pump assembly . I give up on this thing.This would be a great practical joke if it did n't cost me so much money .	-1
If it works , it works pretty good . Chances are you will get one with a missing O ring though . Several people on car forums I am a member of receive defective items including myself . I called customer service after multiple emails went unanswered . I told them I think it was missing an o ring because it would not hold a vaccum . They said `` yep it might be '' and that was it , no `` we will get one right out to you '' or ship it back for an exchange . They were very rude . I just sealed it with some gasket maker and it works now but looks terrible . I would go with a different unit with beter quality control .	-1
Used this tool to remove my fuel line on a fuel filter change ... OMG I was under the truck for over a hour wrestling with it ! Eventually the tool broke ! What a piece of junk ! I ordered the metal sissor one off of Amazon , got the fuel line off in 2 minutes ! ! ! LITERALLY ! I heard the click , and the fuel filter just came out ! Save yourself some time and aggrevation ... if you have a Ford truck , get the sissor tool , not this plastic junk .	-1
I got this to try to change out a fuel filter on a 03 F150 . It 's very nice that it has a bunch of different sizes , but there 's nothing to grab onto . Once you slip it over the fuel line there 's only the little larger piece of plastic to grab , and I was not about to generate enough force to pop off the back fuel line . I also found that the harder I pushed the more the tool sort of opened up . If you could get your fingers directly behind the wide end of this tool you could really generate a lot of force and probably pop the fuel line off easily . The way it 's set up , though , you can't.While it 's more expensive , I think the larger aluminum one-size tools seem like the way to go . There you actually have something to hold onto . I should add , though , that I have a feeling my fuel line is a bit rusted / gummed up and so perhaps under normal conditions this tool might work without a huge amount of effort . Pushing as hard as I could , though , I was not able to get the fuel line off with this tool .	-1
I decided I needed a new seal puller and picked this up cheap here on Amazon . I tried to pull two seals with it today and it just tore through them like a can opener . It would have been easier to use a hammer and a chisel .	-1
These will slip off and damage the clamp as well as skin your knuckles.Maybe if you were in a place with good access to the clamp it would work . I was despirate when I bought these and just wasted money	-1
Nice rig but it becomes unhappy and sticks if you use it in cold weather , below 40 sit seems to stick . So if it sticks your back to using it as a tire inflator and using your tire pressure guage again . The entire reason for this thing is to pump air in read it your done . Not the case . If it sticks not you have lost faith in it .	-1
I should have returned this . It 's no strobe light . The Inductive Timing light is so much easier , at least where you have battery power . Its made well but be sure to have the device fully inserted into the wires . Mine fell on the floor for not double checking the wire attachments and it could have damage it .	-1
I bought this first thinking it would be a good buy . I left it in my glove box , only to find it one day , bent . Did not last long in storage . I then I bought the digital tire pressure and tread depth combo . Way better product . Look up - Accutire MS-48B Digital Combination Tire Thread Depth Gauge and Tire Pressure Gauge	-1
Far too flimsy . This thing feels like it needs to be packed to the gills in order to retain its rectangular shape . Would also appreciate some type of rubber/velcro grip on the bottom so it 's not sliding around in my trunk when lightly loaded.It does it 's job , hence the no-return , but at the same time I did n't expect & # 34 ; soft sided & # 34 ; to mean & # 34 ; collapsable in all situations except fully loaded .	-1
I wish this had rigid dividers instead of just fabric . The unit is too floppy in general unless you load it up with a lot of stuff.This is only a tiny but more useful than a standard duffel bag.I would recommend you spend a bit more and get this one -Snap-on 870116 21-Inch Trunk Organizer and Tool Carrier . I did and am much happier with it as it is ridid and seems to hold just about as much stuff .	-1
I really was n't impressed with the overall result of this Polish , as part of the Mother 's 3-step kit . I used all 3 steps , and still think I get better results from Tech Wax .	-1
It would have been a five star review . But 409 works better , on cleaning up a bike . Mother just makes the part you use it on look wet , and leaves the dirt beneath . Four stars ...	-1
This kit seems like more of a hassle than it was worth . After using one clay bar , my car 's finish was indeed smoother , but it looked exactly the same . A few little spots of sap came out here and there , but I honestly think the same thing could 've been achieved with Goo Gone and Windex .	-1
I have been detailing cars and aircraft for forty years.I have tried almost every thing out there as far as waxes and cleaners go.I 'm am a old school Simoniz guy . Yea , lots of work ... but it works.I would always use a cleaner first , Dupont worked.I figured it might be time to try something new.So I tried the Mothers clay bar . Did not work well.I tried Meguires Clean and wax and that stuff is great.Tried Klasse , real good stuff.Micro fiber.. the more you spend , the better you get.The clay was a joke .	-1
Purchased this product to remove a minor scratch , it ate through my clearcoat and left me with $ 400 in damage . Had an auto detailer look at the damage before getting it fixed , he asked what product caused it and I told him & # 34 ; ScratchX 2.0 & # 34 ; - he replied & # 34 ; Oh , I would never even use that stuff , it 's too abrasive. & # 34 ; Bottom line , from my experience with this product : do not purchase it under any circumstance unless you are very experienced working on cars.This is truly a one star item . Avoid at all costs .	-1
i tried it on a superficial scratch , and kept rubbing the product several times , and reapplied 3 time and scratch is stil there , i tried it with foam pad , microfiber pad , microfiber towel , worst product meguairs produce .	-1
This is not a rub on , buff off product , like wax . It takes a lot of rubbing against the scratch.It appears to be doing more harm than good , adding scratches to my fairly dark vehicle . I 'm using it by hand with a foam applicator , which never has scratched my finish when waxing . I find the results of a good coat of wax do a better job and do n't add additional swirlmark scratches like this stuff . It may work better with a power buffer . By hand , it 's pretty useless .	-1
Does n't work worth a darn . Regular wax works better than this product . Very disappointed with Mequiar which I thought was a good brand . I will go back to Turtle products from now on .	-1
As title says - waste of time , money and calories . I have 08 BMW 335i Sport . Silver color . Have long scratches similar to those that guy posted in product images . Spent almost an hour , tried all different techniques . This product simply does n't work . If you have a new car with nice paint , I would avoid buying this . It might work for some old cars which paint is in different condition , but not for me - sorry.P.S : I bought a full set of Meguiar 's paint care , you can find my reviews on other products as well . What actually worked for me ( somewhat ) is Ultimate Wax and Clay Kit ( contaminant removal kit ) , Clay Kit is very hard to apply though , but it works .	-1
Not really impressed with this product . The Meguiar 's cleaner/wax product does a much better job . This may be good for some cars , but not mine .	-1
this product is good but not outstanding as Barry Meguiar says not last as long as he says I 've used both summer and winter and in 6 weeks lost many of its properties . in the real world , not in the world of Barry Meguiar you have to wax the car every month if you want to protect your car . is not true that regardless of price waxes last for many months.since you apply the wax starts to degrade the environment , sun . uv , rain , dust . when you wash you remove the wax inevitably part because dust and pollution and the polluters and stick to the wax and when you remove these contaminants also remove the wax .	-1
I 've owned this wax for some time . It does n't last more than a month - if that . It 's a pain to put on and take off . It goes on ok , but taking it off is another story , leaves a almost a oily residue until you wash your car , or use numerous towels/microfiber to take it off . How much do you really want to rub your paint to get the residue off ( I have black paint ) ? I have n't really seen any good protection from the elements or from birds/bugs . One postitive is that it does smell good when applying it but I 'm sure Meguiars added the fragrance for some marketing perspective . All in all , for the price compared to durability - this stuff is a waste and not sure why Meguiars even put it on the market .	-1
Meguiars came out with the original NXT around 2005 and it was actually a pretty good product . Not the greatest shine but was fairly durable and easy to apply . Then , sometime a few years later , NXT 2.0 was introduced and to me , it was a huge step backwards . Although it just received a highly favorable rating from the big consumer magazine , it is far from one of the best products on the market . This version 2.0 has very poor gloss characteristics on dark colored cars and the durability is just terrible , literally no more than six weeks before water stops sheeting off the car.I maintain eight different personal cars and so am almost always waxing something . I think all the high priced , multi-step products are just so much snake oil being sold at outrageous prices and trust me , I 've tried almost all of them . Good surface prep is the key to the success of any wax/synthetic product and that involves clay , light cut cleaner , polish and then the final way . Once prepped properly , just about any product will do really well and , if applied regularly , will protect the finish and make future preps unnecessary . My current favorite for durability and shine is Turtle Wax cleaner/carnuba although the good old Meguiars cleaner was in the purple bottle is still a darn good product at a bargain price .	-1
This product is easy to apply and easy to wipe off . But , on black cars especially , it does not give a nice deep glossy or `` wet look '' shine . It leaves more of a streaky oily finish.I switched over to yellow carnuba wax and the difference was night and day . I have a full bottle that I no longer use and it 's just sitting in the garage collecting dust.If you have a black car , and stick with carunba wax instead of synthetics . Meguiar 's to make great products , but this one fails to impress.I get a better shine off of Meguiar 's cleaner wax than this NXT stuff.But a friend introduced me to Mothers pure carnuba wax and I have since made a switch in brand . I mean the shine you get with this stuff is just insane .	-1
After buying the Meguiars DA Polisher and the `` frequently bought together deal '' including the 6.5 '' finishing pad and the 6.5 '' polishing pad I found out directly from Meguiars that they have updated the pads to 7 '' which include a recess to make centering the polisher 's backing pad easier AND have improved the Velcro backing pad adhesive so that the new 7 '' pads are actually machine washable . The Velcro pad is attached far more securely . The older 6.5 '' pads often lose their Velcro backing due to washing/cleaning.There is no doubt in my mind that the pad material is of high quality on either the new 7.0 '' or this older 6.5 '' pad , it 's just that Meguiar 's has improved and updated their pads now . The recess on the back of the pad definitely aids the user in centering the pad , that one feature alone makes buying the 7.0 '' pad a no-brainer . Combine that with the improved backing pad adhesive and now we have a slam dunk.Here are the links for the newest and improved pads : SOFTBUFF 2.0 FOAM POLISHING PAD 7 inchMeguiar 's W 9207 7 '' Soft Buff 2.0 Foam Finishing Pad	-1
Also had some baked on oil stains on tti ceramic coated headers on our 70 challenger caused by leaking rear main seal . Once repaired tried semichrome to remove them . No success at all . Again pulled out the mother 's , , , ,although slow and tedious , it did the job with no damage to ceramic coating.Screw on lid on mother 's makes far better sense . Semichrome lid requires an inconvenient pry tool to remove , , , ,which tends to clobber lid causing it to not seal well . Additionally semichrome is somewhat on the order as twice as expensive . I should have purchased a tube instead of a can to give it a try , , , would have saved 15 or so dollars .	-1
From the moment you touch the package , you 'll begin to wonder if this came from a dollar store . It has that knockoff look and feel that you just do n't see in mainstream stores.And once you have the `` flare '' out of the packaging , you 'll probably notice how it 's about ready to crack before you even screw on the battery cap . You may even notice ( or be disturbed by ) the similar look this has to a more adult-oriented item.But hey , the box says it 's a super-bright LED that 's as good as a flare , right ? Well , that 's not so true . The dopey LED is n't very bright at all . If this is as bright as a flare , then a MagLite is as bright as the sun . I wrote it off to the crazy no-name AAA batteries and tried some fresh Duracells . Same result.But ... but ... it says it has a map light , too ! Indeed , it does . Hopefully , there 's nothing red on your map , because the `` map light '' is that same dopey red LED -- but not blinking . And really , that 's something to give some serious thought to . If it was really that bright , would they suggest you use it as a map light ? I think not.If anything , I 'd think that using this as a road flare is more likely to confuse drivers than warn them . In fact , the only useful application this has that I can think of , is using the loophole to tie it to your kid on Halloween . That is , if you 're angry with your kid and want to shame them with something that 's not even as bright as a Glow Stick.Paying more than the cost of a candy bar for this is pure insanity .	-1
This is a little red flashlight , period . Yes , the red light is bright , and yes , it blinks if you set it to do so . But this would NEVER take the place of a real flare under any circumstances.DO NOT buy this to replace the flares you should carry in your car emergency kit ! ! ! ! Most flashlights have the light beam coming straight out of the end of the tube . This one has the light coming off the side , like a beacon or lighthouse . It can ONLY be viewed from straight on ! While a flare puts out intense light in all directions ( like a sparkler ) this little flashlight only puts out light in one direction - the direction you have faced the beam . DO NOT BUY , except as a toy , or as a hiking signal light - I have given it two stars for it being at least that useful.Flare ? No way .	-1
I thought this sounded like a handy item to have in my car for emergencies , so when the Amazon Vine program offered it for review , I ordered it . First of all , it 's cheap plastic and made in China . That alone will usually put me off of buying an item I see in a store.I inserted the included batteries and turned it on . It emits a red light that can either blink or remain static . I thought the light seemed small and feeble , but I waited until nighttime to give it a real test . I set it on my car with the magnetic end holding it to the hood and walked down the driveway to see it from a distance . Although the red light was visible , it was n't nearly bright enough to be used as a flare in a roadside emergency . It was n't even as bright or eyecatching as the lights you see on bicycle riders at night.I would never rely on this product to warn oncoming cars of a breakdown . Nobody would know what it was even if they saw it in time to react . I 'm sticking with real flares , which are visible from far away and instantly tell other drivers of an accident or hazard ahead.I hope nobody decides to use this product as a `` safety flare '' in their cars ! I wo n't even keep it in my car as a `` map light '' as they suggest on the package . I 'll rely on the small mag light I already have in the car .	-1
I was enthused when I first saw this product . I strive to keep safety items in the car and house , so this one seemed perfect . A flare that runs on batteries ? I could get a bunch of these for my car and for my boyfriend 's car , and make sure we 're always safe ! I popped in the batteries and turned it on . This is a flare ? I took it outside . I tried it at night . There NO way a car coming down a highway is going to see that tiny light and know anything is going on . A person relying on this is setting themselves up for a catastrophic disaster . Having a high-powered flare is n't just a casual `` nice to have '' thing . It can literally be the difference between staying alive and having a sleepy trucker barrel into the car , demolishing it.The light is n't even strong enough to read by in the car . There 's nothing I would use this for . And the fact that they market it as a flare safety device concerns me greatly . I worry that someone will fall for that claim , try to use it as a flare , and end up with serious injuries - or worse.I highly recommend that people buy REAL FLARES for their cars and check on them every year or two . Have flashlights . Check the batteries . Safety is important.Definitely do not buy this product .	-1
When I received Heininger 1020 CommuteMate `` Flameless Flare '' , I had high hopes ... real flares can be dangerous , messy , and difficult to use . I thought this might be the perfect thing to place in my old truck in the event I had a break-down . I also thought it might be good to take on my ATV trips in the event I break down on the trail and need to leave some kind of visible marker on my ATV along the trail.Sad to say , I was rather disappointed . The flare is powered by two AAA batteries and a single red LED . In the daylight , the light output from the flare is barely noticeable . At night-time it is slightly more noticeable and might serve as a marker light on your car to someone who is paying attention . Or , if you were using it on a dark trail , it might be visible from a short distance . But it really is no brighter than the keyfob LEDs that are intended to assist in unlocking a door . The light is also uni-directional ( only coming from one side of the flare ) , so careful positioning would be a must . I think it would be tricky to use as a map light , too , since maps often contain red text which would be difficult to see with a red light.That said , I will not go as far as to claim that the product mis-represents itself . It is re-usable , and it could function as a secondary warning marker . It is not flammable , and it came with batteries which seems rare these days . The idea for the magnetic end that sticks to the sides of vehicles would be good , if most vehicles were made of steel . But many these days are made of fiberglass or aluminum and thus the magnet serves a limited purpose.If this product were marketed as a sort of a secondary marker light , it might be acceptable . One could place it on top of their car or on the trunk as a `` failsafe '' . After all , the more lights the better . However , the idea that it would serve as a `` flare '' is just not correct . If I were changing a tire along the side of a busy road , for example , I would have NO faith that anyone would see or notice this light in their headlights . I would expect something MUCH brighter for an application such as that , and given that expectation this product unfortunately fell short of both its name and purpose .	-1
If you 're familiar with the red flashing LED bicycle tailights seen on so many bikes these days , then you 'll understand whan I say that this unit is essentially a one-LED version of those lights . Yes , it 's visible from a good distance away , but only if you 're directly behind it ; the lens that focuses the light from the LED concentrates it over perhaps 10 degrees . The base has a magnet it it that will allow it to stand up on the roof of a car , assuming the roof is metal , which is still true for most cars . So as a road flare , it 's better than nothing , but still nowhere near as visible as a traditional flare , or just putting on on your car 's four-way emergency flashers.So what use it is ? It might be useful as a rescue device , for signaling , or locating someone in the woods at night ( if they had the presence of mind to bring it along with them ) . Given the low price , it might be worth experimenting with .	-1
There are definitely some advantages to this over a traditional flare . It will last much longer , and it has a magnetic base that is strong enough to hold it on a metal part of your car . The battery cap screws on and has a gasket in case it is raining . It is also compact and lightweight.The disadvantage is that it is n't anywhere near as bright as a flare . It has a single LED that is very directional . If it was placed on the road in front of a car it would be very easy to overlook.I think a folding triangle with reflective tape along with a couple of flares would be a safer alternative.Sean P. Logue , 2010	-1
At first look , the Heininger 1020 CommuteMate Flameless Flare seems like a good idea . In certain limited circumstances , I 'm sure it might be useful . For most circumstances , however , I would only use it as an absolute last resort.The item is made of plastic . Not just any plastic , but appears to be manufactured of the kind of hard plastic that quickly turns very brittle and cracks when exposed to the extreme temperature variations found inside a vehicle , which after all , is where this item is meant to be kept . While it is battery powered , and does n't really pose any kind of roadside fire hazard , its usefulness is severely limited.First of all , one has to rely on always having it loaded with good batteries . Dead batteries do noone any good , and I 've found most people just throw items like this in the trunk or glove box , and forget about it , not really thinking to check the batteries regularly.But does it work ? Well yes , sort of . The unit has a small lens powered by an LED that either blinks on and off , or lights up continuously . The continuous on is meant for a low-glare map light , while the blinking feature is meant to capture the attention of oncoming motorists . Unfortunately , the LED is not very bright , and is likely to go unnoticed from anyone farther away than 15 to 20 yards , and is so small and low intensity that even if noticed , it is doubtful anyone would recognize it as a hazard or warning beacon . While we certainly do n't want anything so bright it blinds oncoming drivers , we also do n't want something so dim that it does n't trigger anyone 's warning instincts soon enough.Interstate highway ? Forget it , buy some reflective triangles . Rural highways ? Not much of a chance of being seen in time at highway speeds . Well lit neighborhoods ? It likely wo n't get noticed . From my perspective , about the only time a unit like this would attract any attention is if it was on a poorly lit rural backroad where the speed limit is 35 mph or under , and there are no other lights in the area to cause any distraction or overpower the weak light source this unit provides . Then , if your vehicle 's hazard flashers do n't work , by all means this is better than absolutely nothing . Just remember to check the batteries .	-1
Pros : battery driven ; flashing or steady light ; flameless flare ; can be used as a map light ; reusable . Could be used effectively as a light that does not seriously degrade night vision.Cons : Product claims to be visible at 1000 ft , but this is only possible within a few degrees of view . One half of the top lights up for a dim presentation , but the bright LED shines out through a narrow beam like a small red flashlight . Consequently , the flare would probably not be useful in a traffic situation since it would have to be precisely aligned with oncoming traffic and would only be visible by the few drivers within this narrow beam of light . It is certainly not a good substitute for a real flare which is much brighter and omnidirectional . This little light is not as good as the emergency flashers built into vehicles.If you want a safety flare to carry in your vehicle , buy the real thing . If you want a light you can use as a map light without distracting a driver , or to see where you 're walking without seriously degrading your night vision , this red light will do that well .	-1
This item shipped defective . Parts not covered with chrome are rusting . This is usually a good product , I have purchased the same product recently and did have any problem . I need to have these two plates replaced .	-1
fell off almost immediately -- - but it was cheap so no big loss ... only someone anal as me would think the small lic plate screws need covering : )	-1
These chrome caps would not work on my plate . The license plate screws heads were larger than the plastic rings that hold the caps . I ended up using them on my motorcycle . These caps were less money at my local Harley dealer too . I 'd give them a pass next time .	-1
I have two cars , both of which require the large # 14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate ( the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into ) . Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw 's large diameter head . The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch ( 11 millimeters ) . Option 1 : Replace the nylon retainers on the car , but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a # 12 screw . Option 2 : Try to find # 14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads . I shopped around for # 14 screws with smaller heads to no avail . Option 3 : Grind down the screw head 's diameter . Option 4 ( not good ) : On one car I used # 12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter , but DO fit the rings , and wrapped the threads with tape . This sort of works , but I really ca n't tighten them down satisfactorily . So I have to check their security now and then . I 'm leaving the other car as is for now . Maybe someone has more practical ideas ? Sure would like to hear of them . BTW , SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13 : I think I 've found a viable solution to the above problem . I used a # 12 sheet metal self-tapping screw , placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing ( 1/4 '' i.d . ) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw . Used a heat gun ( or you can use a match , BIC lighter or soldering iron ) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a # 14 screw . This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape . One more thing : The THICKNESS of the screw head does n't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring . The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips `` X '' to use the screwdriver .	-1
I 'm pleased with the appearance of these on my nouveau plate cover , but they feel incredibly cheap and I do n't expect them to stay on while driving down the road . I understand you need to be able to take them back off , but I feel like they 're going to fall off on their own ! We 'll see how it turns out .	-1
The covers pop off and are worthless . Do n't buy this junk ! Looks great when you install but the covers wo n't stay on when the car is moving .	-1
This is a cheap piece of junk made in a well-known foreign Asian land known for producing junk . The two lights are NOT LED and do not flash quickly like a real security system . They are dull lights , alternating from one to the other . Do n't waste your money or batteries . Anyone will tell its fake . I threw mine in the garbage ... was n't worth sending back .	-1
This kit is just ok. Every piece in the kit is extremely light weight . If you are a mall crawler and only hit fire roads than this will do fine , if it 's much more than that then look at the ARB kits .	-1
Let 's start off by examining the product claims made by the manufacturer , since some people seem to think that those of us who are n't fans of this product are at fault for expecting it to live up to those claims : * Cleans and lubricates the fuel system* Cleans and lubricates the carburetor and injectorsThese are the words of Lucas Oil Products ( on lucasoil.com ) , not me . So , if you want to lambaste me ( or us ) for expecting this product to clean our fuel systems , you will have to first explain why we should not expect it to , given that the manufacturer says it will.Sea Foam Motor Treatment is claimed by the manufacturer ( on seafoamsales.com ) to : * Cleans internal fuel system components* Clean carburetors , fuel injectorsDo you see the ( claimed ) overlap between the Lucas and Sea Foam products ? I bought a couple 5.25-ounce bottles of this stuff for my car , which had a very rough idle . Certain that all the positive reviews could n't be wrong , I also bought a gallon of it at my local auto parts store ( fortunately , I got a steep discount ) .I put one bottle through the fuel system . No improvement . Then another bottle . Still nothing . No noticeable improvement whatsoever.Eventually , I tried Sea Foam Motor Treatment , and with one bottle of that , got the results I was after . No , I did n't mix the products.As far as I am concerned , this product is positively useless for cleaning the fuel system . & lt ; -- And is `` cleaning the fuel system '' a stated product claim ? Yes it is , thanks for asking !	-1
i have used it a few times and it dise not do what is said of the product the interior doea not come clean it does take up a little dust but thats it , it did not clean all the dust like it said it would	-1
If your interior is already cleaned , do n't use it . It will leave lots of lint on your dash . I have a one week new car and i wanted to keep my interior dust free . So I got this from Amazon with other car care products . I had applied some ArmorAll on my dash and leather seats to keep it protected . After a few days I am noticing some dusts are beginning to collect on my dash . So I wanted to start using this duster . After opening it brand new out of the blister pack , I used it on my dash and it left a trail of lint on my dash and door panel . I thought the duster is chemically treated so that it should `` Pick UP '' dust instead of leaving `` LINT '' ? Now I am not sure if I would ever use this again ... .	-1
the clamps are chincy , the wire guage is smaller than the 12 ' extension I put on the other end of it . If you 're not going to put a huge load on it then I 'm sure it will work but you get what you pay for . If it was heavier duty and had an in-line fuse then I 'd be happy with it .	-1
First of all , the cigarette lighter outlet just does not have enough amps to jump start a car 's motor . Secondly , the plug was shattered upon arrival and render this battery cable unusable .	-1
Both the stock photo , and the J.Koster JPG you see of this product are no longer valid , and whatyou get is what my JPG shows.The product has been cheapened by shortening the wires by half ( now 1 foot ) by the time you spread the wires apart enough for the clamps to reach bothterminals on a standard sized 12 volt car battery , you have just taken up halfthe wire length which leaves you 6 inches left over.I have not stripped the insulation of the wires to check gauge , but it ca n't be anymorethan 18 ; 16 at the most.While the product does work , you would have to use it right on top of the battery , which isOK for me , as I only use it for test purposes.As far as the whole `` Front panel illumination '' line , I ca n't figure out why that is in theproduct blurb ! The product comes in a cheap clear plastic bag , NOT A THERMAL FORMED PACK ! as is shown , sothe product you see is not the product you get.Again , see my JPG of what you ACTUALLY GET.Due to the low price , it is not worth returning , but you should be aware of these changes .	-1
I use a lot of Mothers products but this glass cleaners is the worse . It leave streaks all over the glass . Also , when used on the inside of the glass it fogs up the glass . At night the glass fogs up so bad it becomes dangerous . I 've tried using a Microfiber and Terry cloth towel . I 've switched back to straight water to clean the glass .	-1
I purchased a bottle of Mothers Glass cleaner simply because I have used other Mothers products ( waxes ) and they seem to work very well . Also , this cleaner is safe for tinted windows because it does not contain ammonia.Unfortunately , I was extremely disappointed with this glass cleaner as it streaked more than Windex and no matter what I tried , I could not remove the streaks at all ! I did not notice any difference in the streakiness between non-tinted and tinted glass . Both were pretty bad.I ended up just throwing the bottle out and went back to using microfiber cloths and purified/distilled water .	-1
The tender works marginally well and after a few years the grounding prong pulled loose of the plug . I cut the unit 's plug off and replaced it . This unit keeps the battery charged but I 've noticed my voltmeter reads just over 13 volts every morning so it seems to me that this unit is keeping the battery barely charged instead of fully charged . I recently bought a Solar ProLogix 12 amp battery charger that seems much better built and keeps the battery more fully charged . If the ProLogix literature is to be believed , it is a much more sophisticated unit than the battery tender while the cost is just a few bucks more .	-1
I own several vehicles and motorcycles and I had one of the pre china battery tenders and it lasted for several years . it did so well I bought 3 more of the battery tender pluses at one time at Christmas 2010.one worked for about 9 months and then would not go into the float mode . It killed the battery from overcharging . hooked up the next on a different battery and it worked about 2 weeks before doing the same thing ( not going into float mode ) . the 3rd one lasted less than a week ... ... ... .. each has a 10 year warranty so I phoned deltran and spoke to their `` tech '' . he can not understand my problem ... ... .. tried on different batteries . plugged into outlet first blah , blah , blah . I paid over $ 100.00 for 3 of these Chinese junk chargers.I can send them back and they will check at my cost if nothing is found wrong I would be charged a service fee and return shipping . poor customer service , bad quality . for what these cost they should last.Do yourself a favor and do NOT buy these battery tender chargers ... ... ..Update : 1-15-2014 buy an xtreme charger ... ... I have 3 of the red xtreme charger , see my review ... ... ..	-1
I purchased this Battery Tender to keep the battery in my summer car charged up in the off season . Unfortunately this battery tender caused my battery to leak acid all over the trunk of my car causing corrosion and requiring an expensive repair . I purchased this unit specifically because it 's NOT supposed to overcharge a car battery . What a mistake . Do n't buy this product - it does n't work as advertised . I reached out to the manufacturer via their website twice but they never responded to me . Faulty product + no customer service = fail .	-1
Add me to the list of failures ... after 11 months . I do not know why I ignored over 30 one star reviews . I thought with all of the positives , they must be flukes . Well mine just fried , nasty burnt electronics smell , no lights , no output . It did not hurt the car it was attached to and I discovered it very soon after failure . It is not worth the hassle indicated by others to file a warranty claim . I ordered an Xtreme hoping for longer life and good performance . Anybody reading this review , beware ! The failure rate on these Deltrans is too high .	-1
Had my battery tender plus for just over 2 years and it worked great for those 2 years maintaining the battery in an antique car . Recently I put it on the battery on my daily driver and the charge light did n't come on . Testing on several other batteries seems its lost its status lights and all its regulation and just puts out a constant 15 volts now cooking whatever battery I hook it up to . Their tech support was rude and unknowledgeable . Of course their warranty is a joke since it will cost 50 % of its value just to make use of their warranty . I considered buying another but with so many other choices now on the market I ca n't rationalize the battery tenders high price . I replaced it with a Vector for the same price which has twice the features .	-1
Bought this because of all the reviews , but it did not work for me . My Harley uses an AGM battery , and found out after the purchase that this charger can not charge an AGM battery . For a simple battery maintainer , this product is big and heavy . I expected more .	-1
save your money . cheap plastic stuff that wont work . it wont stay on the mirror it is supposed to attach to . falls off blows off .	-1
Highly recommended . Just make sure it has ample water to get started ( 1 gallon minimum ) . Used in warm and cooler weather without issue . *Update : 4/2014 : after camping an entire season with these , I found that they did n't work very well . Tissue and waste did n't seem to break down very well , and it most certainly does n't mask odors very well . I even tried using 2 packets instead of one ( for a 30 gallon tank ) ; no difference aside from things being very blue ! I think I 'm going to try the `` tried and true '' Happy Campers Organic treatment next .	-1
I have been using the liquid blue stuff for 4 years and never had a problem until trying these blue packets . Now I had to call out a pluber because the toilet paper was not breaking down . Do n't waste your money on this stuff ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! And by the way amazon won ; t let you return it either ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Works like crap . Does not allow enough air in to blow lines out . Save your money and use an air nozzle instead . Trust me !	-1
This product is for turning a petcock valve , not for removing/installing a drain plug . It 's my fault for not reading the description clearly , but what I wanted was a tool for removing the drain plug on my Atwood 6 gal water heater in my travel trailer . The nylon plug is in an awkward location and without a long socket extension ( which I dont ' have ) it is a pain to screw and unscrew . Even though this plug is only finger-tight .	-1
I had this unit for about 2 months . Works fairly well . The tabs on the bottom of the unit broke after a month . I used tape for awhile and then gave up on it . Try the : Valterra A10-2606 FridgeCool 11.28 mA Fan with On/Off Switch . I 've had it for five years without any problem . The Valterra is much easier on batteries too .	-1
Maybe on bus-sized class A motorhomes with larger refrigerators this is useful , but it is not any good for my RV refrigerator ( 26 ft vehicle , decent sized refrigerator ) . I do n't use this , as it is too large , and use the single bars instead . They work well .	-1
broke on day 1. bit cheap in construction.would recommend different product , or even a different approach all together	-1
I found washing cars at home in Florida did not give the same results as California Bay Area water . Too much spoting and white residue left.Saw a review where some one else used this filter for improving car wash water so I bought this filter.PROGreat looking product for the costGret looking packagingProduct screw thread fit water tight to water source and hoseAfter a few gallons the water comes out clear and works well for washing a car and rinsing it offCONWater flow a first was about 60 % of normal due I assume to flow restrictionWater flow after a few more minutes and less than 5 gallons was reduced to 10 % of normalThe reduced flow could barely remove the car wash soapFirst few gallons had a lot of black , I assume carbon , color to the water that became clean and clear water as seen in the bucketNote : I did verify the high flow direction as the lable showed . I may try to upload photos later.OverallFor Florida hose water in the space coast area and used for car wash this is not a good product . For a motorcycle or small product okay.For other uses I have no ideaWould not buy again	-1
The valve looks good but I ended up returning it as it wouldnt work for the way I needed to hook this into my RV 's water system . Application was for a 2012 Keystone Cougar 327RES .	-1
Seemed like a good idea , but it leaked incessantly no matter how much I tightened even with Teflon tape on the threads . I returned it .	-1
No matter how little or how much plummers tape I used this unit would not seal . And the butterfly valve metal bends easily . Would not recommend . I ended up putting the original plastic plug back in . DIsappointed .	-1
I bought this valve with high hopes of simplifying the regular draining of our 6-gal Atwood RV water heater , as removal of the standard nylon plug is a pain due to its location . If you are looking to purchase this product under the same pretense , let me save you the time -- in my case , the better part of an afternoon.First , a quick explanation of how the valve works -- there are actually three components at play : 1 ) the large diameter plug that screws into the water heater , 2 ) a secondary plug that screws into the first , and 3 ) the actual valve which you open and close to drain the water . I believe the intent of this design is to allow & # 34 ; regular & # 34 ; draining of the water heater with the last/smallest valve , while removal of the medium nut could be used perhaps at the end of the season to allow more sediment and debris to exit the tank quickly ( due to the larger diameter ) . Sidenote : opening the actual valve ( the smallest component ) drains the tank very , very slowly , and sometimes only at a trickle if you ca n't get air behind the water -- in my case , I had to open the pressure relief valve ( in addition to all faucets ) to produce an acceptable drain rate.While the valve piece never had any issues with leaking , the other components did . I tried screwing in these nuts with and without Teflon tape , and at various depths . No matter what the combination , there was always a small leak coming from either of these pieces . There appeared to be no way to practically stop the leaking . I also tried wrapping the nuts with an excess of Teflon tape ( 5+ wraps ) , to no avail.I gave up after about 2-3 hours of tinkering , returned the valve to Amazon , and ended up sticking with the standard nylon plug . Hint : Sears sells a 15/16 offset wrench that is perfect for removing these plugs .	-1
This valve is exactly what I needed to make draining the hot water tank in my RV a breeze . Unfortunately , it arrived with a quality control problem - the T-handle was not properly crimped onto the valve shaft . The first time I tried to use the valve , the handle came right off in my hand . Rather than fool aroung with the nuisance of returning it , I reworked the crimp with a hammer & punch . I was able to make it secure enough that I can use the valve without the handle coming loose . Hopefully , it will not work loose & be lost due to vibrations on the road .	-1
First off , my fault for not realizing these are sold in single units and not in pairs . That being said , I 'm glad I did n't buy a second one , as these are hard plastic and will slide easily and not take hold unless you put a rubber mat under it . The good news is , you can pick up a pair of real rubber chocks at Harbor Freight for less than 20 bucks which work great .	-1
You just do n't expect these to be made of hard plastic and so small . But then you look at the price and kick yourself for expecting more . They work , but I highly doubt they 'll still be around in 10 years .	-1
This does not fit my wheels . It needs a hose to fit more stem configurations . The 100 is identical , except for the 0-60 it is 0-100 , but states it has a 11 '' hose but it does n't . I recommend a type with a hose for versatility . The 100 is nice but the 60 is fine for most applications . If you have a bike that needs over 60 than look for a 100 . This is not for all applications . Also be careful not to drop this or you throw it away .	-1
I purchased the Camco 11553 Anode Rod for my Atwood heater . The anode was poorly manufactured and had a slight bend in the shaft . This slight bend is enough to mis-align the treads in the cap section to the point where if forced into place , it would cross thread the female threads in the water heater . It is not worth the time or hassle to return , so there it is . . . scrap . In the event the anode did thread in properly , the instructions indicate you should pull the anode once a month to be sure you keep the anode in a removable state . Apparently , if you do not remove it once a month , it will corrode in position , making it extremely difficult to remove . I have decided to keep my factory installed nylon drain plug as the plug of choice . My previous RV was over 8 years old when I sold it and I never had corrosion problems with the nylon plug . Save your money .	-1
Easy to install but on the 4th day the self tapping bolts came out-stripped out of the frame . It was adjusted as recommended and I never backed up or turned too tightly . I felt it helped and will likely pay to have it welded in place . Lost one pin and 4three bolts . I would probably buy a Reese equalizer hitch with anti-sway next time but I have an Eaz type .	-1
Do n't buy Optima Batteries ! Pure junk . After Johnson Controls bought Optima and moved the factory to Mexico they have gone downhill . The last three I bought all went bad , one before I was even able to use it . I had bought an Optima to power my 56 Chevy , and after it sat unused for a month , I went to try and start a new motor ... nothing . Would n't even take a charge . Save your money and get one at the local parts store with a warranty.FYI essentially all auto batteries in the US are made by only 2 companies and then branded . Exide and Johnson Controls . Check it out .	-1
They are rather small and really cheaply constructed i could have bought stuff at the store to build these cheaper they went with my old pop up trailer when i traded it in .	-1
Only the stand is aluminum . The center shaft , handle , and top are steel . Mine started to rust within a week of use .	-1
All of frams oil filters are nothing but cardboard inside . I saw several video 's on youtube showing how bad these are so I cut my old one open at 3000 mi . to see if its true . Its TRUE ! All cardboard even the end caps . Even the tough guards ! All fram filters are like this . Whats worse is the pleats . The cardboard pleats close shut and this makes the oil have to seek another open pleat to enter . Mine had half of its pleats closed . That means only half the oil filter was working.Next is the seem were the pleated rows are connected . It was open half way up the seam because the glue came loose ! That means dirty oil was by passing the filter all together . These are the worst filters on the market no doubt . Fram just spent so much money blowing smoke up our tails we believe they are good filters ... .Cut your old fram open and look inside . If you dont want to get dirty just go too youtube and type in fram oil filter . NOTHING BUT GARBAGE ! Fram could'nt care less about the life of your car . Buy anything else but fram ! ANYTHING .	-1
Cheapo replacement for the one I wore out . But the tip has not cover on the metal wire wrapped around the bristles so I can pretty much guarantee it 'll scratch the tire . Until I find a good rubber tip to glue on it wo n't get used on my wheels . Not worth sending back . This is not the one to buy until they fix that little tip .	-1
I bought this due to positive reviews but never again . I leaves streaks and smudging no matter how I tried to use it even applied more than once . Tried it on window glass in the home , mirrors , and car glass , all the same result . Really wanted it to work but plain water would do better . I rarely write a review this negative but this one earned it .	-1
On the advice of a friend , I replaced my Toyota Tacoma 's manual transmission gear oil with this Royal Purple Max . From the start , I encountered poor shifting and excessive gear noise . After two months the shifting got so bad , I opted to replace it with the previous gear oil I was using ( Redline MT90 ) . Now my shifting is back to being easier , with the gear noise gone ... For the price of this oil it should have performed better than it did - I was very disappointed .	-1
I bought this to polish chrome wheels . The PowerBall Mini is a huge letdown . The foam started disintegrating almost immediately when run across any angle of the wheels surface . The foam is simply too weak , it rips and shreds . I would only use this on very smooth surfaces that have no angles to them , ridges , bumps , etc . But if you 're polishing something that simple in shape - you do n't need this in the first place . Grab a rag and you 'll be done a lot faster .	-1
To costly abd does n't work any better or easier than a brush anddetergent to clean the tires and rims . WOULD NOT buy again .	-1
I used this to clean an expensive set of whitewall tires before selling a classic car at auction and it was a big mistake ! I bought this because I wanted to use something safe to clean the whitewalls . It did OK on the white area , as in it did n't ruin it . The black part of the tires ended up discolored with streaks . It looked horrible ! The tires looked better before I used it ! 409 and Simple Green do a better of cleaning than this product.I will never trust this brand for any product .	-1
I bought three bottles , all sprayed very poorly . It came out in blotches , would not cover the tire well . I had to take a sponge to spread it evenly on the tires . The cleaning was not very good , better results with car wash suds .	-1
Per another reviewer : AN EXPIRATION DATE ? ! ? ! ? Give me a break . Mine arrived Dec 2012 and they expire Jul 2016 , so I at least have 3.5 years to enjoy my purchase . Perhaps the resin gets brittle ? Perhaps that 's as long as the lawyers wanted to wait for a suit ? They are also placarded ( and , to be fair , noted in the description ) to be used with 29 '' tires max . Fine for cars and trailers , not usable for motorhomes which will typically start at 30 '' and go up from there . The tight curve of the chock means that the larger tire , even a 30 '' or a 31 '' , hits the TOP of the chock first ; and this chock 's hard , slick plastic will not grab a surface like concrete or asphalt , so the tire just pushes the chock along.Too bad really , because it 's a really beefy chock with a great ergonomic design , allowing you to easily grab it for insertion or extraction . Sad to say , I do n't think the basic purpose is functional .	-1
this is a wallpaper seam roller . i bought a plastic one at lowes for 2 bucks . u can get a rubber one for 6 bucks at a hardware store . im sure this roller does work , but 13 bucks is crazy . i beat the heck out of my 2 dollar one and its still going .	-1
My 6 years old Mazda 6 2.5 liters GH 5 speed shifts abruptly from 1-2 gear , did tranny filter change and drain fill 3x , before pouring this whole bottle in ( ATF requires 8.5 liters ) . No difference at all , stills shift hard . However it does n't makes the shift worse so I 'll give it 2 stars for wasting my $ though it 's a cheap gamble .	-1
This gauge is accurate and easy to read , but it is very difficult to get a good seal . There is no rubber inside the stem and you have to get the right angle to get a good seal . In the meantime air is escaping and its a game to get the tire pressure right where you want it .	-1
I bought this tire gauge a a little over two months ago . The first few times I used it , it performed admirably . It 's ergonomic , with a clear LCD display that gave a fast , precise reading.Fast forward to the end of June . After only three uses ( and being stored in my glove compartment otherwise ) , the gauge is now wildly off . After reading the tires on my truck as 32 PSI four weeks ago , plugging it in today registered 41.5 PSI . I thought maybe it was the heat we 've had this past week , but a change of 9.5 PSI seemed a little high , so I tested it with two other tire gauges , which read 33 and 33.5 PSI , respectively . I used a pump with a manual gauge to drain a tire and inflate it to 33 PSI , but when I tested the tire with this gauge it read it first as 41.5 PSI and ten seconds later as 40 PSI.Perhaps I got a dud , but any gauge that 's off by that much so soon raises a red flag for me . I 'll be looking for my next tire gauge elsewhere .	-1
we bought this at canadian tire and within a year or so the tire gauge split lengthwise along the seam - making it useless - as the air just leaks out the side and does n't measure the pressure ... i give it one star for lack of durability ( its not like we use it daily ... so maybe 10 uses ? )	-1
I purchased this tire gauge becuase I wanted a digital display gauge that provides1 psi resolution . While the Accutire MS-4021B generally does the job , there are twoannoying features that should be changed :1 . Batteries can not be replaced by the user2 . On some valve stems , the Accutire MS-4021B does not make a seal to get an accurate readingRef . # 1 : you have to send the gage in to the manufacturer who will replace the batteries free of charge . However , their turnaround time is more than two weeks , and I had to call their service department both times I had batteries replaced to get a replacement tire gauge.Furthermore , the batteries do not last more than a year or so , but I use tha gauge on a weekly basis for all my vehiclesRef . # 2 : this appears to be due to the chuck design , i.e . the contact pin does notprotrude far enough to allow a positive seal on some valve stemsI am still searching for a digital tire gauge that allows the user to replace the batteries	-1
Do Not waste your money . Bough a mid grade & # 34 ; full size & # 34 ; digital gauge and found this one to be off by 5lbs !	-1
Well , it works . Look , I expect a product to be user friendly ... this one is awkward to put on the valve and then read . It does not always give you a good readout the first try . I will have to check the valve two or three times to get a proper read . By time you do four tires your knees are shot . The digital read out is not very bright either . All and all I am looking for a better gauge . Lots of folks liked it though , that is way I tryed it , so its up to you.Of course , if your are young enough , and have good eyes and knees this is probably just right for you . Good luck .	-1
I , like other reviewer , was unable to get a wide enough positioning for the lasers to reach the center dash of both cars . I had to dremel out the surrounds of one of the lasers to get it to go to the right position for my garage ceiling height . Other than that it works fine and is a moderate improvement over the tennis ball method . *Update*After installing this device for a months , we have noticed both lasers are getting pretty dim . A few times I have completely missed seeing them on my dashboard and pulled the car too far . Luckily I use a brick as a safety stop under the tire or else I would have nicked the wall . Short product life .	-1
Junk . Watch the videos on Youtube . It 's effortless to get off .	-1
I tried this out , twice as per the instructions . Didnt make much difference at all . Should have just kept my $ 20 .	-1
Paint was thick and didnt spray on very even at all . Was trying to tint fog lights and just didnt work .	-1
I ordered one of these for my 2008 Saturn Vue . Package marked for 2008 Vue but item did not work . Contacted storefront who fullfilled order for Amazon and was referred to Curt mfg . to obtain return number . Then had to contact seller again . Got a refund but I purchased a replacement from a local dealer . Seller later reported a wrong item number was somehow in the package .	-1
I wanted good quality and these were the highest priced covers listed on Amazon . They said `` only 4 sets left ... order soon '' . I ordered the correct size and part number . The correct size and part # was on the receipt/invoice when they arrived ( 19 days later ) , but they sent covers for a 13 '' wheel ( I needed 28 '' ) . When I contacted Amazon , they said my size was no longer available so they sent these . Are you kidding me ? ? ? 13 '' covers for 28 '' wheels ! ! Who made this decision ... a monkey ? So I sent it back for a refund . I could n't tell if the covers were good quality , cause I never opened the box . What a major let down after waiting almost 3 weeks . I went to a local camper store and got a set there the next day . Sometimes , saving a few bucks just ai n't worth it ! !	-1
Schumacher SEM-1562A 1.5 Amp Speed Charge MaintainerWell worth the price ... does exactly what it is suppose to do . ( Update ) After using this charger less than 5 mos . to maintain my R.V. , which is seldom driven , I have found that , because of the charger failing to cycle back to the charge mode properly , the battery that it was hooked to was stone dead . Now , I 'll do some research to find out the annoying process of returning the charger for warranty . ( Update ) I have contacted the manufacturer , Schumacher , concerning the failure of this charger but after 3 weeks , have received no response and it does n't look like I am going to . So , I guess I 'll just take the loss of making a bad choice and trash it . BTW , I am using two Chicago Electric on Board chargers , one on my Jeep and the other on my Mercury Sable . Both are giving very good service and are less expensive than the Schumacher or the Battery Tender .	-1
Had it for a week , does what it says it does , but make absolutely sure the clips do n't touch anything when it 's attached . Positive alligator clip got close to inner hood liner and burned . Flamed up . Burnt the red plastic boot off and if i did n't blow the liner out ( I freaked ! ) , my vehicle would have gone poof ! Pilot error ? Bad design ? Who knows.Edit : Just called Schumacher and they 're replacing it , no problem . Upping my rating from a ** to *** . Thanks Schumacher .	-1
I 've sent back two of these and both have failed . Talk about cheap junk do n't waist your money . I now own a Genius G3500 3.5amp and it kicks big time butt .	-1
Another reviewer mentioned this charger puts out 15.0V in AGM mode and that 's too many volts for some AGM batteries and it caused his to outgas ( reducing the battery 's life ) . My Optima yellow top AGM battery is rated for 15V charging so I thought this charger would be okay for it , but the charger I got puts out 15.5V ! I did find specs that say 15.6V `` regulated voltage '' is okay for `` rapid charging '' on my battery but they do n't define what rapid charging means . They do say with 15.6V to `` charge until current drops below 1 amp '' which I think means you can do 15.6V until the battery gets closer to being charged and stops accepting high amperage . Unfortunately this charger does the exact opposite , starting at lower voltage and increasing to 15.5V around when it decides the battery is at 90 % charge ( which seems to equate to about 12.6 or 12.7V on my battery ) . The charger keeps outputting 15.5V until the battery is fully charged , which may take hours , so it seems unlikely that 's good for most batteries and I 'm pretty sure it 's against the charging specs on my battery . Note that the charger shows 15.4V on its readout but my volt meter shows it 's actually 15.5V.Nevertheless I let it keep doing 15.5V and checked periodically to make sure the battery was n't hot ( it never even felt warm and an IR temperature gun read 86F max ) and was n't hissing ( hissing would mean it was overcharged and releasing gas , permanently reducing its life ) . It took almost exactly 12 hours for the charger to decide it was 100 % charged and go into maintenance mode , but when it did , it picked 12.4V ! AGM batteries are supposed to be charged at around 13.6V for maintenance ( float ) charging , so I have no idea why it picked 12.4V . I left it on for another hour and it actually reduced the voltage to 12.3 , at which point I took it off the charger . Volt meter said the battery was at 12.31V.I ca n't decide if this charger is broken , has a weird charging algorithm , or is actually very smart . I say that because my battery was discharged to about 3.5V a few weeks ago , well below the voltage it 's designed to be discharged to ( it 's a `` deep cycle '' but even deep cycles do n't tolerate discharging below 50 % , and even below 10.5V may hurt them ) , so it 's now damaged and wo n't hold the full 13.6V it 's supposed to . Instead , if I leave it on the charger at 15.5V for an hour , it hits 12.8V and then quickly loses charge to 12.5V in about 30 minutes . So maybe the charger somehow figured that out and decided that 12.4V was `` full charge '' on my damaged battery so that 's what it used as its float charge . I do n't see how it could determine that if the battery was 12.8V or higher after the long 15.5V charge , but who knows.I also do n't know if 15.4V is really bad for my battery , or for the `` average AGM '' . I spent awhile researching but could n't find any real authoritative information , just a bunch of people theorizing . Since it 's above the 15V standard charge on the battery spec sheet I do n't think it 's a good thing , but then again I also found research ( nrel dot gov/vehiclesandfuels/energystorage/pdfs/evs17pres.pdf ) showing that seriously overvolting a yellow top battery to 17V under certain conditions actually increases its life . So I do n't know what to think , but I 'm leaning towards thinking it 's a bad thing to go against the manufacturer 's spec sheet unless you 're in a lab using specialized chargers.What I do know is that the desulfination feature on this charger did n't do a thing for my damaged battery . In fact I do n't think it even kicked in . I connected the charger to a small sealed lead acid battery that I left unused for too long and it went into desulfination mode ( I think - the manual does n't say how you 're supposed to know ) for over 8 hours pumping 16.8V into the battery until it said `` bad bat '' on its screen and stopped charging . In all that time the battery never showed over 15 % charged on the charger , though it did end up holding about 10.9V . In my online research it was mentioned in a few places that there are no studies showing desulfination actually works so I 'm pretty dubious about it . It definitely did n't work on either of my batteries.It was also interesting to note that the sealed lead acid battery never got warm , which I find rather curious considering how long it was putting in such a high voltage . I had the charger connected to a kill-a-watt meter and it showed the charger was pulling only 0.15amps and 9watts , and this is in 2amp charging mode , so maybe the charger is smart enough to use low amperage when it 's using high voltage and that prevents the battery from getting damaged . When it was pushing 15.4V to my AGM battery it was only drawing 0.35amps and it actually reduced the amps to 0.29 as it got closer to 100 % charged . So maybe that protects the battery from overvoltage damage , but I do n't know enough to be sure . Maybe a battery expert will chime in in the comments.Another important thing to consider is that desulfination mode could damage your car 's electronics if you do n't remove the battery from the car to charge it . 16.8V is more than most cars were designed to handle , and I found someone mentioning that BMW warns not to use chargers that do things like that , so it 's definitely a concern . I do n't know if I feel comfortable using this charger again without removing the battery from the car . Some chargers claim to somehow magically detect the presence of car electronics and limit their voltage , but this charger says nothing about that in its manual.Other than all that , the design of the charger is nice . Wires fit into a pocket beneath the retractable handle . It will show you the battery voltage on its readout until you tell it to start charging ( although it reads 0.1 to 0.2V lower than my volt meter , which is annoying ) . A button lets you toggle between display of voltage or battery percent . It lets you choose standard , AGM , and gel cell , and choose from three rates of charge . The slower 2A charge rate is supposed to be better for many batteries , so use 2A or 6A if you are n't in a hurry . I tried both those modes and it still puts out 15.5V in 6A mode but it puts out 15.3V in 2A mode.Since this is a dedicated 12V charger you do n't have to worry about it `` autodetecting '' ( actually , auto-misdetecting ) your discharged 12V battery as a 6V and never charging it past 6V , which is a problem with far too many chargers these days.Despite its nice controls and smart form factor , I give this charger a low rating because I think it tries to push some batteries beyond their limits in the name of charging them as quickly or as fully as possible . One reviewer said it caused his AGM to outgas and another said it burnt out his battery after a few months of trickle charge mode . If you have the right brand of battery that can handle this charger 's output , and your battery is n't damaged , it 's probably fine , but the fact that it can damage things and may even damage car electronics in desulfination mode strikes me as very bad design , especially given that desulfination seems like more of a marketing ploy than a valuable feature . I also do n't like that its volt meter reads 0.1 to 0.2V under actual voltage .	-1
I use this on the back window of my Jeep Grand Cherokee . It does not flex enough to have full contact on the window . It only has about 8 & # 34 ; of contact . I will not purchase this again .	-1
It was quiet and smooth for about 2 months in rainy Seattle . It 's not particularly great . It 's squeaking now . The plastic & # 34 ; booty & # 34 ; that covers the arms I guess supposed to work to prevent snow from clogging the wiper but did it help ? Meh ... .hard to say . The ends of the wipers have some RED plastic caps on them and it 's very distracting to see something RED swooshing in front of my face in the rain . Why could n't they use black caps ? I 'm going to look for a triple bladed wiper blade which worked better .	-1
09-19-2012 . Not delighted with this product . Perfect fit for Jeep Commanders I own . Products were new in manufacturer packaging . Buying them from amazon.com saved me time and effort . I installed them within minutes of opening the shipping containers . Ready to go within two minutes . Great service , but the end result after only 90 days of use is VERY dissappointing.1-24-2013 . Nothing I do will make these wiper blades lay flat on the windshield and this leaves uncleared mess right in the driver 's viewing area . I 'm replacing them with PIAA Super Silicone blades . I expect the PIAA will perform better in the Washinton , D.C. area . I 've used the ANCO Winter blades before without problems but these units have a serious problem in cold ( below 20 Degrees F. ) weather . The rubber case around the mechanism gets stiff and the blade will not stay flat against the windshield when it moves off the curved `` rest position '' of the windshield . This leaves an uncleared area in the middle of the driver 's viewing . Not a good thing . I will not use them again . We have had several warm winters in middle-Atlantic coast area so I did n't experience this issue before . The rubber case to keep the ice and snow out of the wiper mechanism is a good idea but it just does n't work . Sad .	-1
I actually bought these from a local auto parts store . This was about a year ago . It started raining out of no where and my old blades were not helping . Right out of the box these worked `` ok '' . Within a few months they were streaking , by the time the wet season ended they were totally ineffective . They actually made things worse .	-1
These blades did not last a month before I had to get new ones.I no this has been a harsh winter in NYC but the regular wiper blades lasted longer.Not recommended .	-1
Do n't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB , it will NOT fit ! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere !	-1
Very cheap blade , mine started chattering in 1 week and I returned them . Buy a quality Motorcraft ( or similar blade ) Amazon has the best customer service and took them back ...	-1
The worst blade I have ever used . I assumed the first one was defective , so Amazon replaced it . The 2nd one was just as bad . About 30 % of the blade did not contact the glass - so a huge portion of the windshield was never touched .	-1
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander , and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However , this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander , nor would it fit other Toyota 's with the rear blade that has a `` wider than normal '' base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander	-1
I used for 1 day and and it destroyed itself with a pine needle . Now I get streaks where the pine needle , or any other item I assume , has been dragged . So unless you are meticulous and clean your blades before you use them everyday and or get out of your car and clean them immediately anytime any item may fall onto your window , do not buy these . Unless you do not mind streaks . The damage is permanent , not only when the item is still on the window .	-1
So I pour in a good amount and mix it with water . In the bucket there is a lot of suds , but then when I apply it to the car , the suds do n't carry over.To me , soap is just soap , however this soap has a nice smell to it.It does n't remove dirt or debris any better than the next soap , however I used to use Rain X with Carnauba wax , and that was a great car wash soap . It left my car shiny after washing and this -- I have to wax it after . I bought this at Costco for like 12 dollars , and it lasted me quite a while . I would n't go back to this as it does n't wax my car . Also -- it dries fairly quickly for some reason and leaves a soap residue .	-1
Difficult to apply and gooey . Made a mess . After I am done using this up I will be going back to my spray from Meguiar which is great and lasts .	-1
So I recommend this to clean your tires , but it will strip the wax coating off the rims and leave the rims really dry ... ...	-1
NO PROTECTION FOR LIQUID so it leaked all over the place . Was just placed in a box 20 times the size with brown paper on top . As they used UPS , and UPS does not handle with care this tends to happen . So I am out of my monies as will not allow returns on this product and it was damaged in shippment !	-1
I have not read anyones reviews , but I can tell you I bought a dozen of these , what a waste I ised them on aluminum , plastic and chrome rims , and the brake dust does not disolve , loosen etc ... water and scrubbing works better . Find another product .	-1
I love meguiar 's products but this wheel cleaner was a waste of money . It really did not clean the wheels as suggested . Do n't waste your money !	-1
I 've used this on two cars and I 'm not sure it 's actually better than the soap and water wash I gave the tires and wheels before applying . It just seems like fancy spray bottle of soap .	-1
I 'm generally a big fan of the Meguiar 's products , and use them for washing , drying , waxing , etc . Got this thinking it would be a good addition to the lineup . However , not only does it not really add much to the overall look , but the application method is all wrong.This product comes as a spray , and is designed , as per the instructions , to spray right onto the tires . After doing so , it does make the areas where applied shiny , but the application is uneven , and even then , because it 's a mist , it goes everywhere ( onto the paint , the wheels , etc ) , which is bad . So you end up having to use something like a paper towel or a cloth to spread the product evenly , which ends up removing most of the product ( and making a mess overall ) . Then the shine is gone.This product would be better made as a bottle that is made to apply to a pad or some other applying tool , as the spray is too difficult to control to get it only on the tires.Since evening it out also means removing most of the shine , whatever soaks in leaves a dull but darker look . So , in the end , the best it was able to do was darken the tires slightly . The product briefly mentions protective qualities , so a star for that , but it seems like an afterthought in the advertising materials , so I 'm somewhat doubtful about that . So overall , this product does n't seem worthwhile ; it 's more trouble than it 's worth . It basically made a mess , made the tires darker , but duller looking , and made the logos/letters/numbers on the tires less visible , which in the end made it look less cool than before . So , I wo n't be using this particular product again.Other Meguiar 's products are great ; but this one is not an essential . It seems like a very niche product that one would only need for special photo shoots , etc , in a controlled environment , but not as an everyday car polishing tool .	-1
The meguiar 's hot shine high gloss tire spray is not impressive . When I spray the tire shine on my tires , I find myself having to go back after about 5 minutes and wipe it down with a towel because it leaves drip lines down the tire . Kind of like if you put too much paint onto something and it leaves runs . The consistency is equivelent to regular grade milk , It is not a gel consistency . Another issue I ran into is , I will let the spray dry on the tires for approximately 30-1 hour and I still notice that it shoots up on the side of my car makings spots on my rear bumper and front doors after driving . I like using the gel type of tire shine better , that you brush on . It flows on better without leaving streaks or runs and it sticks better to the tires , not the side of your car . One last thing I noticed is when I spray the tire shine on my tires , it leaves a dark crescent shape on my driveway that lasts for months . Not a big deal , but it angers me that it sticks better to my black asphalt driveway than my tires .	-1
I purchased some much thicker microfibre towels , as these ones just are n't thick enough to soak up sufficient water . These are now relegated to cleaning the windows and wiping down the interior	-1
After drying my black car a few times with this towel , it performs no better than any other towel I 've ever used . Sure , it holds a lot of water but that is part of the problem . It does n't easily wring out so after just a few swipes it is completely saturated with water . Anything that I dry with it after it becomes wet leaves huge water streak marks behind unless I follow up with another dry towel . My best results have been a traditional chamois that is easy to wring and does n't leave streaks behind after the first pass .	-1
Once it gets wet , there is n't much you can do about wringing it out . It 's title is true . I do not know why some give five stars to this product is very difficult to use it . might not have used it and lie so bad that confuse buyers because they believe that having five stars is a good product but it is not true .. I recommend the pva Chomu . I have one for seven years and works extremely well .	-1
Let me state up front - I was my car a lot and I mean a lot . Two to three times a week or more . I normally use soft cotton bath towels and change them out as I go so I always have one semi dry towel to remove the last bit of water . I do n't have problems with this method as I clean my towels often and keep my car waxed so the system works well for me . No scratches or swirls.But ... I thought I might be missing something so I got one of these towels and frankly I really ca n't see the point . While it might be softer than a normal cotton or terrycloth towel and does soak up a lot of water , it pretty much stays wet after that . You can wring it out , but it just spreads water after the initial use no matter how much you wring it . If you 're going to use it as a first pass to soak up the majority of the water then I guess it 's okay . But as your car starts to dry you end up putting more water down then was there when you started . Unless you have a bunch of these towels so you can always have a dry one , it 's not any better than the method I use now.I just do n't get the point or value in using these towels and they 're pretty small too . I do n't know that it will ever be part of my normal car washing routine , but it 's unlikely . It 's a nice towel , so I might find some other use for it as some point.I ca n't recommend this to anyone for it 's intended purpose . Just use some good soft bath towels and save your money .	-1
Meguiar 's has always had great products so I thought I 'd try it and compare it to my Viking Microfiber Waffle Weave Drying Towel . It does n't really compare ... .far less absorbent , and too small . I can dry my whole Range Rover with the Viking ... this barely made it past the 2nd quarter panel .	-1
To be honest , the towel was n't really that water `` magnet '' . I personally find my old towel would do a much better job .	-1
No luck with this Meguiars product , Its does just okay when drying the paint after I wash my car but the glass is another sad story	-1
I was looking for a nice towel and after read these reviews I was convinced to buy this product . Im disappointed because im Meguiars fans and I was sure that would be a nice product . Its does not abborb the water as announced .	-1
Bought this despite the poor reviews , figuring maybe since most of the reviews were older that they may have improved the towel since then . Nope . Quite possibly the worst towel I 've ever used . It basically just pushes the water around on my car and soaks up some of it , but does n't really DRY the car . It just smears it around until the water evaporates into the air . My old beach towel worked 100x better . And I thought Meguiar 's was supposed to sell good quality products . Live and learn , I guess .	-1
This product is so inferior to Griots that it is not funny . Look , Meguiar 's makes great car wax products , this is probably a product they sub out and then add a make up too . It 's too thin , to small , just all together beneath the reputation of Meguiar 's product line . As a drying cloth not very good at all . As a wax removal cloth just not good enough . Listen if you detail your engine compartment these are just fine . If you are not a car person , these are going to be good enough for you , really . But if you are fussy about your car , wax it , detail it ... . these would be the product you want to use for wheels , engines and door jams . I already own them so that is what I will use them for , same a an old house towel would be used . If that is what you are looking for , look no further , these will do . But for drying or wax removal ... .NOT .	-1
I used it to wax my daughters car . It fell apart before I finished applying wax . Was very dissatisfied with this Meguiars product .	-1
Amazon said it fit a 2007 Honda Element , but the Element wiper arm is not a J hook . Amazon needs to fix their wizard ; this makes me hesitant to purchase other auto parts from them .	-1
According to the selection process , it showed that this product fits my car . I have had trouble making this fit for my car . Again , with all my reviews , I research more than the average person and thus far I had to put the old wiper blades back on my car - sorry ... . I hate giving bad reviews , but this is what I feel .	-1
The three year old Bosch wiper was squeaking because it 'd turned stiff and would n't flip over on the opposite stroke . I replaced it with Rain-X . The wiper streaked along its entire length after installation when I used my windshield washer . I 'd hoped that in a heavy rain it would clean up and work well . WRONG ! It got worse and my visibility was so poor that I felt that driving was dangerous . Luckily I did n't have far to go before I could change it . I 've always liked the Rain-X liquid so felt that I could trust the brand . Maybe I got a bad one but I 've never had this happen with other brands . I wo n't chance buying these again .	-1
Did n't last very long in the Florida sun . Not impressed with any of the Rain-X products . Would n't buy again . Prood that a good marketing plan can sell even an inferior product !	-1
Purchased a set of these wipers for my wife 's Rav 4 March of 2012 . As rainy season was about over , decided to keep them in the garage until a couple of days ago . Installed them easily.Fired them up to try them , , , ,windshield was wet from morning dew . Streaked badly.However drove off with them on as was in a hurry and felt that I would deal them later.Later yesterday , got a bit of rain . Turned them on , they streaked so badly that almost unable to see at all , , , ,the left side far worse than right side.Windshield is clean and smooth , , , ,no roughness or defects.Today I called Rain-X support 1-800-416-1600 and spoke to a lady named Adrian.Told her of my issues . She asked when purchased . I said March 2012 and installed a couple of days ago . She then said that there blades were only good for 6 to 12 months . I told her that had been stored . She asked if in `` temperature controlled environment '' ? . I said in the garage where temp never exceeds 85 degrees and were kept in original packaging in a dark closet . She said that was the problem.I told here that the original wipers on the Toyota Rav 4 were 3 years old and still functioned better than Rain-x that were 6 months old , stored properly , , , not exposed to elements and never used , and yet were far worse in smearing of windshield than the old originals.She then told me that they have 90 day warranty and with receipt I could return . I said that I purchased 6 months ago and had kept for when I would need them . She said that was too bad and there was nothing that could be done , , , , , that my improper storage was why they failed.I asked her if 3 year old originals that had been used and baked in the sun and elements were superior to Rain-X blades that had been stored properly for 6 months and unused . She said that she was not suggesting that at all.As an aside , , , ,made in Korea , assembled in China. Can not understand why Rain-X even provides a Customer Support number , , , ,as there certainly is no support here . If Adrian was my employee , I could can her as she truly is inept.Likely the worst product that I 've ever purchased .	-1
.Car waxes seem to have a fair amount of sizzle and hype included at no extra charge.After using both products , I preferNu Finish Liquid Car PolishZymol is : * Much less durable than Nu Finish , according to Consumer Reports tests ( Nov 2011 ) * About twice the cost ( see Note 1 ) - Shelf life is not as good ( see Note 2 ) If your time counts for anything , durability is a big deal . Same protection , fewer waxings.- - - Paste Wax Alternatives - - -These paste waxes are even more durable , according to the CR report.Nu Finish Paste Car PolishorTurtle Wax T-465 8 Oz Ice Polish Paste- - - Notes - - -Note 1 : Amazon price for Nu Finish swings mostly between 7 and 11 . Wal-Mart has it for about 8 . This compares with about $ 16 for Zymol.There 's an `` Online Price Alert '' that will email you whenever this or any amazon product dips below your target price . Google it . It 's nicely done . Or try camemcamelcamel.Note 2 : Shelf life : I have bottles of Nu Finish and also Zymol from about 6 years ago . The Zymol is separated into grainy chunks and thin liquid -- hard to re-homogenize , but the Nu Finish is perfectly good .	-1
These little things are really cool , so I would recommend them if you do n't mind drilling out your plate mounts . I just wonder what kind of idiot would use larger screws in their product than the US standard .	-1
STOP ! Got this to take out the front side oxygen sensors on my 2002 Ford Crown Vic Police Interceptor P71 . It does NOT fit , no way , no how ! Get a 7/8 '' combo wrench or one of those fancy pants combo wrenches with the split socket at one end ! My sensors were n't even that tight !	-1
It is a cheap steel receiver tow hook . Nothing more.A retainer clip to keep the strap in the hook should have been included at the very least . Otherwise any slack might make your tow strap pop out , or worse yet , stab your strap over the end of the hook and rip it.I have done a lot of pulling , vehicle recovery , and off-road driving . I 've seen every scary , unimaginable tow method . And , I 've seen people use things that were not designed for pulling like cables and chains . Misuse of these items can seriously injure and kill people , as well as do major damage to vehicles . Because , when you put thousands of pounds of stress on a tow line and suddenly it breaks or lets loose , it shoots straight back in the opposite direction and will go RIGHT THROUGH windshields , radiators , plastic , sheet metal , and BYSTANDERS.If you want something to keep in your trunk in case you ever get stuck in a ditch , or if you even THINK you 're an off-roader gearing up for the trail , DO N'T BUY THIS.Frame mounted clevis points are the safest bet . But , if you do n't have that luxury at least buy a receiver CLEVIS mount with a closed eye and a screw-pin clevis.Other safety advice from experts : Only use a soft nylon tow strap rated at least twice your vehicle 's weight.Never use a strap with built-in hooks or metal eyelets.Never use chain.Never use wire rope cable.I knew the dangers when I bought it . But I 'm not using it for towing or emergency recovery . And I know how to and not to use it .	-1
I bought this to pull small logs and brush around our farm . I got stuck in a creek bed which was MUCH softer than I thought . My '96 Ford F250 diesel weighs over 7500lbs with an extra fuel tank on it . It is a heavy truck , but it 's no semi or anything . I got pulled out by some guys in a smaller Nissan pickup , which was light enough not to sink in the creek . They took a `` rolling start '' of FIVE FEET , not more , which completely straightened out the hook ! ! ! I do n't know if I got one that somehow missed the tempering process , but what a piece of $ *** . Just for more background , the 10 foot tow strap was rated at 5000lbs , so the force required to straighten this hook was less than that . It might as well have been made from aluminum . I ca n't complain too much at under $ 20 , but I thought smittybuilt meant quality . I was n't taking a 20mph go at a stump or anything . I 'm glad that I could attach my strap to the frame easily enough . If it had been an emergency situation I 'd have been buggered .	-1
I received it as a gift a few weeks ago , and am selling it again.There is no real benefit of having such a unit.First , the mounting is an issue as you have the cable running across your dashboard . Having a second plug on the right side is interfeering with gear shifting and whatever controls you have in your center console . It would be better to have a plug on the left side . Using the one in the back makes the cable run all across the dashboard , no thank you.Second , besides the tachometer ( if you do n't have one ) what data readout do you really need ? Really need ? Nothing , exactly . Codes can be red out by any Auto place for free , and what are you doing if your converter speed is at a certain speed ? Exactly , see what I mean ? Okay , volts maybe , but just maybe.The unit , sent back to ScanGauge for testing , does hardly come on by itself , so you do n't really know if any of the fuel/trip data is accurate . This makes it already questionable , and therefore I do not have any use for it.So , for us it is another item where we have to question its quality and reliability.Less than 1 month old , contact me if you want it . I take of 20 % right away .	-1
Before purchasing this item I called the manufacturer to be sure it did what I wanted . They said it would but it did not . i called them back and they said it was capable of what I wanted but I would have to program it for it to work . Not what you read on the package , not what the manufacturer said , and directions so poor I could not beging to program it and I 'm a geek .	-1
The grease is perfect . The thing that bothers me is that I used this one time ( very gently I may add ) and the tube that it 's in got a bunch of little pin holes in it and now the grease leaks out in my tool box . To make matters worse , I opened the tool box the other day and the cap had split in two so now there 's even more leaking out ! I thought I could buy this and keep it around for future use , but now I am going to have to throw it away after using just a tiny bit on my spark plug wires . What a bummer .	-1
I started out very happy with these , but see updates at the end of the review.The hatch on my 2002 Grand Cherokee developed a nasty habit of falling on my head because the struts were starting to lose their lifting power . I bought two of these , and in about 20 minutes , the problem was solved . They have been installed for about a month , and seem to be working just fine.Installation was easy . The old struts were held by two bolts on each strut . Once they were removed , the new ones popped could be screwed in . You may have to hold the tailgate as far open as possible to install the strut.A couple tips from the installation:1 . Get a helper . Much easier if someone holds up the tailgate while you are trying to replace these.2 . You will need a Torx bit- not sure of the size , but it was the largest one in my kit.3 . The existing bolts are on pretty tight . A drop of penetrating oil on the screw made it easier to remove the bolts.4 . My Torx kit only had a cheap `` screwdriver '' handle to hold the Torx bits . I ended up destroying this handle because the existing screws were in so tight . It is probably worth buying a ratchet wrench setup before you start.5 . One tip- when installing the new strut , it helps if you snug up the upper screw first . This slightly lifts the strut , making it easier to line up the bottom screw.Hope that helps . The whole process was actually pretty easy- if you can use a socket wrench , you can do this.UPDATE : 9/9/13After 7 months of relatively light use ( I open the tailgate roughly 3 times per week ) , my opinion of these has gone from 5 to 1 star . They still work , but they make so much noise I am ashamed to open my tailgate within 100 yards of people . Opening or closing the gate will result in a very loud screech from both struts . Not an annoying little squeak , but a very lout , annoying , nails-on-a-chalkboard screech.I have tried a film of oil , silicon spray and creative language , but nothing will remove the screech.I finally tracked down the StrongArm supplier , AVM industries and left an email message on their customer service website.Update 9/24/13I guess after 2 weeks , they have no intention of replying to their emails . I called their tech support number 800-790-5438 . No answer , but left message.Update 9/25/13Another phone call , another message . Still no answer back.Update 9/26/13I passed the Amazon 30 day window , and thought I was stuck . But I contacted Amazon customer service and told them my story . Within an hour I received a reply , and Amazon is taking them back and providing a refund.So , a happy ending , but I will never touch another product made by AVM Industries.Update 10/16/13Got my refund , less a 20 % `` restocking '' fee . Chalk up $ 7.50 to `` experience '' And Finally- 10/18/13After contacting Amazon Customer Service again , the refunded my restocking fee .	-1
Bought two of these for my 2003 Grand Cherokee Limited . One fit well but the other was longer . I could n't compress the piston enough to fit it , and trying to screw it in ended up snapping the metal , making it useless . I put the stock lift support back in and now I have one new and one old . It opens better but still not very good .	-1
I have been washing all my cars for years with Turtle Wax Car Wash and have always been satisfied with this Turtle Wax products.When I bought this product , Turtle Wax ZIP CarWax , I was really disappointed about its wash performance : - the & # 34 ; concentrate & # 34 ; in the bottle is very watery to begin with ; no comparison to Turtle Wax 's original ZIP car wash- even though I used 1 fl . oz . ( ~ 30 ml ) with a bucket of water this product does not generate any suds- because of this it is tough to get grime and dirt off ; you have to scrub really hardI am baffled that this product has so many positive reviews ; maybe Turtle wax recently has changed the formula for this product , and I got the newest version .	-1
Meguiar 's Quik is cheap , which is great as long as your interior is already pretty clean . It has no intrinsic cleaning power of it 's own beyond that of water . In other words , it will clean exactly as well as a damp cloth . Any dirt that ca n't be lifted with a damp cloth will stay put . It does have a nice scent , which dissipates in a matter of hours . You 'll probably want a more effective product if your car gets a lot of use and/or carries many passengers .	-1
I use a lot of Meguires products . This product turned my dash board splotchy and brown in spots . I went over the cart a few times to make sure the product was being absorbed evenly . It made no difference . The plastic on my console shifter indicator also turn blotchy . I waited a day and then went over everything with Meguiars # 40 Vinyl and Rubber conditioner and everything turned out great . I believe the # 40 is a much better product at least on my car . I called Meguires and told them what happened . They told me the # 40 has as much uv protection as the Quick Detailer . They had no explanation as to why I had bad results.The plastic on my console is still blotchy but I will try some plastic lens polish to try and fix that . Just glad I did n't use this on my instrument panel .	-1
I bought a set of these ramps and they flat out do n't work on my 2010 Dodge Ram 1500 4x2 . In my garage and/or on an asphalt parking lot they do n't stay put . When I drive up them they slide forward and my truck just scoots them along . I have to `` hold '' them in place by using rubber floor mats and/or wood stoppers . Yes , they have the rubber feet on their base but they do n't hold . Hate them ... .and would n't buy them again . I returned them .	-1
I bought this stuff for my 1947 Willys Jeep . The transfer case/transmission has developed a nasty leak recently , and I hoped this product would help . I added a full bottle to the transfer case ( which was leaking the most ) and a bit to the transmission sump ; they are interconnected , but have separate fill and drain holes . It was very difficult to get into the fill holes because of the viscosity of the stuff ( about the consistency of molasses ) . I drove around today , about 40 miles or so , and both the transfer case and the transmission still leak about the same as when I put it in . I can not recommend this product for anyone trying to fix a leaky transmission .	-1
Appears to be honda civic compatible . But after using Lubegard I have found a stark difference ( better ) with Lubegard . Lucas works but it slows down shifts ( about a 2 seconds delay ) and I had to gun the engine to get that power transfer up a hill or long shallow incline . Lubegard transfers power to the civic very quickly . I suspect that the reason is because lubegard is very thin and Lucas is too thick and tacky . Maybe it will work for you in a much more positive way , but not for me . I am surprised that other reviewers are saying that it makes shifting BETTER ? ? ? I will assume they never compared it to lubegard , so they would have known what smooth really is , like i did . OR perhaps it really shifts better based on the particular car make and degree of tranny damage ; so in all fairness , I can not knock those reviewers , but you can try lubegard . I stand by it ; if you want smoother shifting ( does not stop leaks if you have any ! Conclusion : I deleted my initial review , in favor of lubegard . Lubegard is clearly a better product ( but not all their other products are superior though ) . Lucas works so-so . I took off two stars after I found another product that works better . No , I do not work for them OR sell their products - I just love to tell people about great discoveries .	-1
This product does not work exactly how Lucas says it does . I used this in a Detroit engine that was not burning oil before I used it but afterwards was.I have talked with many drivers ( truck drivers ) who have used this with the same results . I will never touch another Lucas product . This stuff is a sham and a waste of a Drivers hard earned money . If you want to do something good for your engine use Synthetic engine oil .	-1
I wanted to save a few bucks and paint instead of buying caliper covers . I know paint prep is important for this type of job and spend at least 30 min on each wheel . I also followed the temperature and curing times closely . I used 3 to 4 coats on each caliper . Within the week there where multiple large chips flaking off .	-1
This digital tire gauge drains battery even if you are not using it.I checked my tires once a month , but , I already have to change battery about once per year.The gauge still use power to memoris the pre-setting of tire pressure . come to think about it , thepre-set memory is useless if you have 2 different cars . ( Because it only can memoris one front and one back tire setting ) . The 2032 lithiumX2 battery is not cheap , I expect it should last at least 5 years .	-1
I must have misunderstood how this siphon works . I have never been able to get it work at all . I have tried every possible method and no luck . I understand how gravity works but apparently this device does n't . If you get it to work , more power to you .	-1
I had a time trying to keep the connections from leaking . As you tighten the connector on it would torque the hose and it would unwind and loosen the connector causing a leak . I ended up putting a pressure regulator on that had a rotating connector . It allowed the hose to untorque itself without unscrewing the connector .	-1
Found this dangerous for my 29 ' Airstream . It 's fine for level parking , but do n't use this on sloping grades . Trust me on this one . For smaller , lighter campers I 'm sure this would be ideal .	-1
I bought this jack stand to replace the assortment of wood blocks that I used under the front tongue of our 20 ' camper , weight about 500lbs , when parked at the storage lot or while out camping . By the second season the base had fatigued and cracked in a circular manner and by the third season I had to remove it from service because I felt it would not safely hold the weight of the tongue . I was pretty disappointed considering how much I spent and inconvenient is was to store away . I 've moved on to the & # 34 ; Flip-foot & # 34 ; jack extension .	-1
When I bought this product I thought `` great I wo n't need to bring heavy cinder blocks with me anymore . '' Well , I was wrong . The top is too narrow for my jack to go on safely . When I put the camper on it , it seems way to unstable .	-1
used it on a surface on my BMW 328ic near the trunk area . I had 2 little spots approx . 1x2 & # 34 ; on the left and right that had rust forming UNDER the rubber gasket ... I brushed of the rust with a dremel type tool and metal wheel brush to clear all rust and paint and used this on top . let dry for a day before repainting and applying clear coat . It does not seem to penetrate the little rust remaining as other products . I used & # 34 ; Rost-Egal & # 34 ; from Germany many many years I lived there and that has been the best product so far . You use it once and just know it works . With this very liquid product I am not so sure ... It did not even seem to & # 34 ; stick & # 34 ; very well to vertical surfaces . For the next job I will look for a & # 34 ; thicker & # 34 ; product that will cling more to the treated area .	-1
I realize that there are testimonials for this product actually doing what it says it will do . I have not had an occasion to need it in an emergency . AND - I hope that I never do . It does not inspire confidence . It feels like something that would be included in a child 's toy tool set . Extremely lightweight . Directions state you must hit the window in a specific location - good luck with that in an emergency . I was hoping for a tool with enough weight , which added to acceleration , would break the window . Again , I have not used it , and I will not trust it in an emergency - so I will be looking for a better product . I do not recommend this item ... at any cost .	-1
I had higher hopes for this , but for the cost , I guess I should n't have.Unit is light - about the weight of a candy bar is how it feels in your hands . The cutter has a horrible entry angle , you 'd think in an emergency your tendency while using this would be to pull straight up , but this is angled at more of a 45 degree angle so that wo n't work quite as well - things have a habit of getting caught and folding over with my testing.But the mount - oh my , it 's just horrible . In every respect . There 's a little sheet inside that recommends using sticky backed velcro to mount it . But the back is hollowed , with just a few thin lines of plastic that the velcro sticky side could even stick to - no way there 's nearly enough surface contact for that to be even remotely feasible . There are screw mounts , but not many people want to drill screws through their cars interior . Then it 's a really tight pull to get this thing out of it . Hardly what I 'd want to have to deal with in an emergency , trying to pull this out , having the whole thing come out because the velcro sticky back could n't adhere to the base at all . Then trying to pull this out of the base while I 'm fumbling to pull both sides apart from each other , while theoretically in an emergency situation in which I may be in a deadly situation , or addled because of an impact or airbag deployment ... Going to look for a better solution , since this one clearly is not it .	-1
I used Royal Purple Synthetic in my last Truck for a few years until they started asking arms , legs and first born children for the oil . I did my homework and started reading reports of independent lab 's testing . I found out that Royal Purple ranks below Mobil 1 and Amsoil . I switched to the best oil made , Amsoil , and never looked back .	-1
Do n't buy this unit . Buy Camco 39062 RV Dual Flush Pro Holding Tank Rinser with Gate Valve instead . This unit will let you back flush but guess what happens when you want to disconnect the hose.I guess it 's only good for connecting a hose for extending the drain ...	-1
After the battery is mostly charged , this charger goes to 16.4 volts and starts boiling the electrolyte . Normally when battery is mostly charged , the voltage should not go that high ! ! ! The charger did not switch to a float mode either as it was supposed to.To make sure it is not a battery issue , I tried to use this charger on 3 different batteries and saw the same result . Charger at 16.4 volts and boiling electrolyte . If I was not keeping a close eye on the charger , it would have destroyed my battery by boiling out all electrolyte . I thought this thing is `` smart '' and `` automatic . `` Did I also mention that one time I was tried to use the charger ( see above for results ) it was making a lot of loud noise because of a constantly running cooling fan .	-1
I was expecting a better charger I could not recommend it to any one.ps it works ok but it has a cheap look to it .	-1
I planned on using this unit to charge my auto batteries and then leave it on trickle charge . However , it has a FAN which constantly runs and will wear out , just like the fans in the PC 's do . I do n't know , but I also bet that if the fan bearings fail and the blades wo n't spin , the charger microprocessor will not operate for safety reasons . Really poor product design to use up fan life when you want to trickle charge a battery over the winter .	-1
I tried to charge my car battery and it showed 12v at 40 % so after four hours it showed 12v at 100 % . I removed the cables and after 30 minutes it showed 12.1v at 52 % and after two hours it was at 100 % . Let it sit again and it was 12.3v at 71 % . I tested the voltage at times while charging and it never went above 12.5v . I do not believe that this is a reliable charger so I returned it for a older model SE-5212A . I have used Midtronics products so I understand the microprocessors and there quirks but nothing beats the old tried and true charges that have metal cases and transformers . Do yourself a favor and do n't buy this it 's junk . P.S it 's 3/12 Amp not 3/6/12 Amp . This charger works if you have a battery that is weak but if your battery is under 9 volts you have to keep unplugging it and start over and over until it reaches a threshold to maintain it . The cooling fan does not run all the time and the unit over heats and then I would have to let it cool down and start over again .	-1
I purchased this to charge and Maintain batteries but the unit I got does not maintain at all and the cooling fan never operates no matter what amp charge setting . Connected to a car battery I start charging and it shows battery is at 70 % which is nice and after full charge at 100 % the charger goes into Charge/Maintain mode but that 's where it stops working like others have reported ... came back to the battery after two days and the battery is n't charged and so I unplug the charger and plug it back in and it shows battery at 52 % . The battery is connected to 4 10 watt LED lights that come on after dark for 6 hours so I expected this charger to start charging when the battery is down but that is not the case like how my last battery charger/maintainer worked . It only seems to charge and not maintain so It 's being returned to Amazon.Do n't trust it to keep a battery maintain.Update . Amazon replace charger and was quick about it ... but the new charger arrived DOA and now on the way back to Amazon for refund . Done with this brand .	-1
I wanted to use this to fill transmission oil into the transmission after performing a filter change and dropping the transmission pan . It broke not even after putting 2 quarts in the pan.. Needless to say that I was not happy as I had to WALK to the next car store to buy a replacement since I coudl not drive with only 2 quarts in the tranny . Buy 2 or 3 to be on the safe side if one fails or use a different solution to begin with . I am using a funnel from now on in combination with a longer plastic tube going down from over the engine .	-1
First the good : It seems well made , pumps very easily and moves a decent amount of fluid with each pump.The bad : It says it fits quart containers but it would not screw on to my Redline quart bottles . I also had a gallon jug to pump out ( which it did not fit on either ) and while doing so , the pick up tube dropped off into the jug . Naturally the tube is an odd size and nothing I could find laying around the garage would fit on there so I ended up cutting off the top of the jug to retrieve the tube so I could finish the job . The end result was quite a mess of gear oil all over the garage floor . If you buy this product make sure the bottom tube is pushed in place tightly ! ! !	-1
Pump works great but the delivery leaves a lot to be desired . I should have realized that the cc volume it delivers per pump was going to take forever to empty a quart of fluid . Live and learn . I will still use it , but only when all else fails .	-1
Honesty look like a toy , really is a toy.This pump is too weak and it does n't hold almost nothing .If you plan to buy , check another bigger .	-1
This did n't do what I need it to which was to remove glue from my paint car . I even heated the remnants of glue and still did n't work . I 'm disappointed .	-1
Horrible material ! I have to say that this was a total waste of money ! I would not recommend this to my worst enemy ( yes I would ) !	-1
i bought these for my rv trailer . They are too flimsy and thin for the weight ofmy trailer and the do not fit well under the tires . the lip is guess you would call it is too thing to fit snug in place . there is no string to help you remove or pull them away when packing up . i am buying a different set .	-1
What was I thinking ? What was I expecting for 4 bucks ? I thought I was getting a solid hard plastic product ( maybe I did n't read closely enough ) . Instead I got cheap hollow thin walled plastic that is n't fit to chock a tricycle , let alone a 10,0000 lb trailer . These things will obliterate the first time a tire even comes in contact . Your tongue jack , and stabilizers are the only thing that will hold you . Do n't even think about using them when you disconnect from your truck unless you 're on perfectly level ground . use a piece of fire wood . These things will crack like an egg in cold weather , and melt like putty on any day over 60 degrees . Is n't there some sort of safety standards for this sort of product ? Do n't waste your money.Was n't even worth the time to return .	-1
These things slip on a hard painted concrete floor . Possibly OK on asphalt , but not concrete . Pass on them , get something else .	-1
Had planned to drop these behind the wheels on the truck when we put the boat over.But they want to slip on the concrete ramp as soon as the tire tread starts to push.Does n't seem to matter whether I plant them before easing the tires back , or hard-place them at the tires , because as soon as enough drift happens , the tire and chock move together .	-1
I was expecting a solid rubber-like product . It looks and feels like moulded plastic . Seems to do the job though , and it 's very light-weight.Update - Changed my mind . Forgot they were in place and rolled my trailer right over the top of them . Crushed them flat . Worthless , in my opinion .	-1
For myself , these might work ? Only because my car is very small and barely weighs 1800lbs . These are not solid , they are a thinner plastic , maybe 1/4 of an inch thick . They do however stack together nicely to make it easier to store them . I would n't recommend these to anyone , not even a Go-cart racer.When I seen RhinoGear I imagined thick sturdy rubber chock-blocks not thin plastic cups .	-1
I brought this product to my mechanic to see if it is advisable to add to my coolant while at service . He told me never use with aluminum radiators . Also there is nothing wrong with my coolant system so he flushed the system with distill water and added Toyota Red coolant to a mix approximately 50/50.The mechanic added , only Royal Purple product he might use is brake fluid for its color so when you flush the brake system you can easier to tell the fluid is clear when purple fluid starts breeds out.I was laughing reading those reviews of swearing up and down how good all the Royal Purple products are . Those clowns are very likely working for or owning Royal Purple .	-1
This thing will mess up your water coolant pump . For some reason due to the additives it has , it corrodes aluminum parts . I had to replace mu thermostat and water pump on my 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee . Royal Purple claim that this additive is compatible with all coolants including Mopar , GMC ... etc . I do n't think so . Not from what I experienced . I strongly suggest you do n't use this product . Plus It did not make any difference in cooling although I had a 180F thermostat . If you are looking for better cooling go other ways such as upgraded radiators or different thermostats rather than this cheap product which can damage your coolant system !	-1
Put this in a Envoy XUV with 17,500 original miles hoping to maybe squeeze a little MPG 's based on the other reviews I read here on Amazon . What a crock ! Did nothing remotely close to lowering temp . Just lowered my pocket book by $ 28 and change because I bought 2 bottles based on Purple 's rep . I had e-mailed telling me 1oz per quart of capacity . Figured I would then put the rest in my wife 's Accord . Temp is actually higher ! I e-mailed rep back and here is what he said : I 'm sorry that you having noticed a temperature drop as of yet , but Purple Ice will not cause an increase in operating temperature . Was this vehicle running hot to begin with ? If so , was the root cause investigated ? No radiator additive will cause an a thermostatically controlled cooling system to run consistently colder than the thermostat set-point . The thermostat is there to help the engine warm up quickly be restricting coolant flow until the coolant reaches a certain temperature . That is its function . If the coolant goes below that set-point the thermostat closes and the coolant begins to increase in temperature until the t-stat opens again.If you were not having overheating problems , why did you purchase and use a product that is intended to alleviate overheating problems ? The product works as exactly advertised . If you would like the vehicle to run colder that the current t-stat set-point you may try installing a cooler t-stat . Purple Ice will help you vehicle achieve this lower temperature after the mechanical restrictions to such an end are removed.In my opinion FALSE ADVERTISING and a SNAKE OIL product BEWARE .	-1
The information on this product states that this item it will fit most RV 's . Not so , not even close . There is no way to even motifiy this item to make it work . Was a total waste of money . I 've had RV 's for over 40+ years , and have never even seen a gutter even close to what this will fit . Not even worth sending back due to the shipping return charges being more that this product cost . Would not recommend this product to anyone . To bad you have even give it one star , in order to leave a review	-1
it looks good and good quality however description was not clear , you will need to unscrew the guter and then drill and then put back ... . i did not even try , I had one before that was snap on , much easier . this one i will not use it.sorry	-1
The install was pretty easy and the theory seems solid however this just does n't work . I tried multiple times with almost zero cleaning . I would skip this product .	-1
First of all , when these work they are pretty useful . That said , I bought 2 ( one for black water and one for grey ) and I tested the spray nozzles on my garden hose before installing . Only one seems to spin fairly regularly , and even that one locked up on occasion . The one that was locked up from the beginning did spin if you twisted it with your fingers to give it a push , but that 's obviously going to be impossible once it 's installed.I chose to install them because even if they are n't spinning , they spray water in an almost 360 degree dome of water , so I speculate that even if they 're locked up they will help dislodge solids and give your tanks that extra rinse we all need . That said , this unique concept of a product is fatally flawed and does not work reliably as advertised . Oh and , like others - the clear hose that comes with it was also kinked bad - on both of them - which restricts the flow of water quite a bit.It 's an admirable attempt by Camco , but similar to other products from them - it 's hit or miss on the quality of manufacturing and the effectiveness of an advertised feature set . Purchase with caution , or just settle for the non-spinning versions from either Camco or other vendors.Another word of caution - pre-drilling the holes for the mounting screws on your tanks is not recommended even though the instructions recommend it . Your tank material is usually a soft plastic , and the screws strip the holes easily . Pre-drilling does not help . Plan on using a lot of silicon to make sure it stays on !	-1
