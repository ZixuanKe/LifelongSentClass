I got this item for my daughter 's Easter basket . It 's the perfect size for the basket and for her since she 's only 18 months old . I could see it being a little small for an older child . My daughter loves Doc Mcstuffins and I 'm very happy to see all the Doc Mcstuffins ' toys available except the price can be crazy at times . The price of this was about on par with what I would have paid in the store but I do n't think this item is worth more than $ 5- $ 8 MAX . But what are you gon na do ? Very happy with the purchase and glad the item came in a plastic bag to prevent it getting dusty at any point since it is a white item . All the ones I seen in stores looked like they had been tossed around . O and yes Lambie is very cuddly !	1
Our granddaughter watches the TV show Doc McStuffins everytime it is on . We sent her Lambie for a special gift . Lambie is very soft , cuddly , and just the right size for a 4 year old . We sent her Chilly and Stuffy also . All were well made and seemed very durable .	1
My 3.5 year old son loves Doc McStuffins and wanted this . It 's a great stuffed animal , seems well made as he sleeps with it every night and brings it everywhere . Survived the washing machine .	1
My son wanted a Stuffy for Christmas . So with his christmas $ , we went in search of one . This was sadly the only one we could find . The price was a little steep , but you are always going to pay more for disney products . My son loves this thing . He carrys it around and sleeps with it . He has made Stuffy a bed out of a box and little blankets . So over all it was a good purchase . Only complaint , the neck is limp . they needed to add whatever they put in the horns to hold them up , they need to put in the neck too . Ours also came with a horn bent sideways but I think it gives it more character . : )	1
My daughter loves Doc Mcstuffin 's , Stuffy , was ordered for her birthday , and she LOVES him ! He is made very well , came as described and in a timely manor !	1
My 4 yr old daughter is a fan of Doc McStuffins and she is collecting plush versions of the characters . I really did n't expect much from this toy . My guess was that it might be carnival quality . Not at all ! It 's a cute toy that 's about 6 inches tall , soft , and looks exactly like & # 34 ; Stuffy & # 34 ; ! No complaints here !	1
This little stuffed animal is well made and is a perfect size for little hands . This stuffy looks just like the one my daughter watches on the television . The smaller size has allowed my daughter to carry this animal around with her and it does n't take up too much room in the tahoe when she brings it with her . I am very glad I made the purchase .	1
MY GRAND DAUGHTER LOVED THIS PLUSH STUFFY . SHE HAS THE WHOLE DOC MCSTUFFINS COLLECTION . SHE PLAYS WITH IT ALL THE TIME .	1
This is the fourth stuffed animal that I have ordered for my granddaughter . He looks very much like the TV character . Stuffy is very soft and just the right size for small hands .	1
This stuffy might not talk , but I can just hear him saying something Stuffy-like ! He is adorable , and in a great pose , easy for Lambie to cuddle him and give him hugs . I feel that my daughter is going to have so much fun pretending this little dragon is alive !	1
My 5 year old daughter is addicted to Doc McStuffins . She carries it around the house all of the time . Great quality and fast shipping .	1
We got this toy at toyrus and ... ... ... .His neck was flopping to the side . when we got him ... we put more stuffing in his neck . [ Emily-5 ]	1
Unless you 're kid is a doc mcstuffins fanatic this is cute but not worth the money . Same goes for the Hallie doll I wanted to give my daughter the whole collection for Christmas but ultimately she plays with Doc and lamby the most .	1
Very Small for price . Got it for a niece who loves Doc McStuffins , she never puts it down , I thought it was way to expensive for a stuffed animal , but it was one of those things you had to buy due to its popularity , otherwwise I would not have paid it .	1
the lovable but clumsy dragon from the hit show doc mcstuffins as a toy plush which you can cuddle hug and love	1
I gave this to my granddaughter the other day and she was so happy to get it . She has visited me at the office and wanted to leave at once to take it home to show her mama .	1
My 6 year old cousin loves all of the Doc McStuffins items and enjoys keeping track of her 'boo boos '	1
my daughter love this she was so surprised when i gave it to her she uses it every day with her best friend	1
my only disappointment with this item , is I thought it would be bigger . it 's so little that it could almost be a pocket book , : ) but the kids love it never the less , they carry it everywhere , they have to take it when they play pretend Doc Mcstuffin , I was told I had & # 34 ; silly-ities & # 34 ; what ever that was . But the book gives the kids free access to their imagination . CUTE !	1
It is so cute . I really love it . Just perfect for my little girl . I know she is just going love it at christmas . She loves paper it is a perfect for her . My daughter loved it ! ! ! ! ! It is the most cutest book .	1
as the proud uncle of 2 little girls I am pleased with doc mcstuffins this toy allows them to pretend to be doctors and teaches them how to draw	1
Simply put : I saved a ton of money.I hate hard plastic.It folds up so it can be put away for a few months then brought out again when she is bored ! Barbie furniture fits fine or make your own , I did make a sofa , chair , and table for about 3 $ .The 7 yr old did not see any difference between this and the name brand it is very satisfied .	1
We bought this house for our 4 year old 's birthday . We wanted something that could store easily when not being played with , yet big enough for Barbies . This house is prefect for that . It is strong enough for Barbie furniture , but we do sometimes have the Velcro come apart , causing the house to sag . Overall , just what we wanted .	1
I was unsure of this purchase as I expected something cheap . To my surprise this is very sturdy and looks great . I love that it 's collapsable so we can hide it from the little brothers destructive path .	1
Really nice , collapsible Barbie house . It took two of us to put it together , but I 'm glad it can be folded up and stored . I like the large rooms and the printed on furniture . The kids can play with it while you look for some bargain Barbie furniture , or even make some with the kids . It 's constructed of thin wood covered in printed fabric . It 's not lightweight like the description says , but that 's good so kids wo n't knock it over while playing .	1
My daughter wanted a doll house but with our family moving a lot for the military , a standard doll house just would n't suit our needs . This house was just what we were looking for , sturdy and colorful . My toddler son and my daughter both enjoy playing with her dolls in it . Fits standard 'Barbie Doll ' sized dolls and has clearly defined 'rooms ' . When the play is done , folds up flat to be stored in small places ( like under a bed ) .No tools required for assembly . The floors velcro with heavy duty velcro and it 's all one continuous piece .	1
This dollhouse is GREAT ! ! i have 2 1/2 yr old twins and this is about a foot taller than they are . The pictures inside are very cute and they love it ! It folds down flat for storage , which we have not done , but it is convenient should you need to do it . It is nice to only pay $ 30 for a dollhouse when you are not sure if your 2 year olds will wreck it or not instead of buying one of the more expensive dollhouses . I definitely recommend this product to anyone with a little girl & # 62 ; It is awesome ! !	1
Although priced fairly , the velcro srtips that are semi sewn on tear and or come loose easily when disassembling the unit . The product is fabric covered particle board and does not withstand much weight . Pricewise it is good enough to get a year out of .	1
I really like this doll house . It was so easy to assemble . Its bigger than it looks in the picture . This can hold barbies , monster high , my scene . The price range is great . This is nice for kids or adult collectors . Very easy to take apart and store away when not in use . It was delivered early and packaged very nice . Any girl 's dream house .	1
I 'm so happy that I found this in store . This and the other version are both nice . Size wise they are impressive and fun for girls . The material is like a cardboard covered in fabric , attachable floors with velcro and collapsable . However , it 's very sturdy and will hold dolls and accessories . I am happy with the quality for the price . In fact , I was really surprised that I found this Barbie house alternative for a very affordable price ! The downside is that no furniture is included , nor can I find any from the same brand . Instead , I bought a few pieces of Barbie furniture - which ironically costs more than the house . If your child has a big imagination and can be satisfied with the graphic furniture printed on the house , then even better !	1
I was not about to spend over 100 on all this , nor do I want another large immovable toy to fill our house . This fit the bill . They can play stuffed animals and tiny mcd toy creatures in this , and we will fold it up and put it away at times to keep it & # 34 ; new & # 34 ; . Today I noticed books on all the shelves - its sturdy !	1
I would give this 10 stars . My great nieces have the Barbie Doll house but with so many Barbies ... I thought an & # 34 ; extra house on the block & # 34 ; would be a great idea . They were more excited then ever when I brought this modern doll house their way . It 's easy to set up and easy to put away ... they did it themselves . And the extra doll house created even more play . I also bought the & # 34 ; Barbie style & # 34 ; living room and dining room set to furnish this home . The parents were also excited as were their friends and wanted to know where to get it for their kids . It is a winner !	1
My twins love their dollhouse - it folds up easily and is easy to put back together for playtime . Love that it has painted on furniture so no little pieces to loose .	1
I purchased this house 2 weeks before Christmas . My daughter had received a barbie package that included a lot of furniture pieces . At the time , we were living in a small rental house with limited space . I did n't want an enormous bulky plastic house for $ 150 that may or may not get played with , so I took a shot at this . I set it up on Christmas Eve , and to my surprise , it was pretty simple . It is made from the same material that those canvas shelf bins are made of , but do n't let that deter you . This house is super sturdy and durable , and the BEST PART- it folds up and can be stored under a bed , My daughter gets a lot of play out of this , and can transition it to fit her toys , some days she uses Barbie and furniture , and it fits great , other days she uses her my little ponies and it works well for that too ! It is a great size , and so easy to assemble and take down after play . Just make sure you store it correctly , do n't forcefully fold it up or it could bend the boards inside of the fabric . We moved into our new house and even though we have more space , I am happy that this space saver can be easily stored for great organization . If you are buying this as a gift and need to hide it , it ships in a pretty large box , so a garage or large closet would be a good hiding spot from curious eyes and hands .	1
Bought this for my soon to be 7 year old daughter because I just can not justify spending $ 100+ on brand name houses.She loves it ! Super easy to dis/assemble , its sturdy , practical , and she really enjoys it . I have no complaints so far . I highly recommend this doll house for anyone , on a budget or not.PROS* Sturdy* Attractive* Budget Friendly* Great Quality* Easy to dis/assemble* 3 stories/levels* LargeCONS* None thus far ( I will update review if I find any )	1
My 3 year old grand daughter loves it . Easy to put together and take apart . Easy access and just the right size for a 3-5 year old .	1
Great buy ! I am so happy I bought this . My 3 year old loves it and the quality is fantastic . It 's heavy duty cardboard so it 's collapsible but not weak at all . This is hands down my favorite purchase thus far for my daughter .	1
Very sturdy and well made . My step-daughter loves it and uses it for her monster high and Barbie dolls . Barbie furniture fits perfectly , and we love that it folds up for easy , quick storage since her room is rather small .	1
I 'm a little biased : Dominion is my favorite game . That said , Dark Ages is one of its best expansions . The new mechanics introduced ( Ruins & Hovels ) for the startup change the nature of the early game completely . The set also includes a lot of fun things that are conceptually the opposite of the Prosperity expansion . Dominion continues to be a well-thought-out game with a lot of layers of complexity , high replay value , yet simple mechanics . Highly recommended .	1
First of all , I 'm not a Dominion newbie - I 've been playingDominionplusDominion Seaside , Dominion : Prosperity , andDominion Hinterlands , for going on three years . I 've played withDominion Intrigueas well . With that being said , I have to say that I was , as many reviewers have noted , in slight awe when we opened Dominion Dark Ages and saw all of the additional cards , 35 additional sets as I recall.I have now played Dominion Dark Ages a handful of times , and my initial impression is that though it 's an impressively large expansion , bigger does not always mean better.I guess my less than enthusiastic endorsement of this expansion comes because we have come to enjoy the up-tempo play that comes from playing with cards from Prosperity where it is relatively easy to accumulate treasure and lots of it fairly quickly . I found that Dark Ages is a more plodding version of the game . I mean , I can never seem to get any traction , especially as the game begins , plus I really miss having Estate cards in the mix . The three cards that are substituted for Estates in Dark Ages are IMO whole unsatisfying at best and largely useless at the worst.I have to agree that some of the action cards add new and interesting twists to this game , but my experience so far is that Dark Ages is a new , but somewhat lackluster addition to this fine base game.My favorite Dominion expansions ( these are the only ones we 've played ) in order from favorite to least favorite are:1 ) Prosperity2 ) Seaside3 ) Intrigue4 ) Hinterlands5 ) Dark AgesI know Dark Ages fans out there will disagree , but this is my experience , and perhaps it will be useful to someone who 's considering their next expansion . Do n't get me wrong , it 's a good expansion , but I personally do not enjoy it as much an any of the other expansions listed above.Cheers4 stars .	1
If you 've playing Dominion , you may have noticed that each set seems to be getting more advanced ( challenging ) , and Dark Ages is the most advanced set yet . Do n't play it with those brand new to the game as many of the card mechanics may be too much to grasp for novices . Save it til they get used to the other expansions and then watch their eyes light up . For experienced players , however , right out of the box , you know you 've got something special here . It 's a game-changing set focusing on a grim-n-gritty Dark Ages theme that concentrates a lot of its efforts on trashing cards for fun and profit.Shelters replace starting estates ( one is useful as it gives +2 actions , the other two either provide +1 card when you trash them or a way to trash them when you buy a Victory card ) . You ca n't get more Shelters than the three you begin with and Estates are still available to buy.Ruins are a new action card supply pile that provide crappy bonuses . These get dished out like Curses through attack cards and are meant to clog up opponents ' hands . Ex : +1 card , or +1 buy , or look at the top 2 cards of your draw pile and keep or discard them ) . One card , Death Cart , self-inlicts two ruins on you when you buy it , but it acts as a Platinum ( +5 money ) and only costs 4 money to get . But you must trash an action card from your hand when you play it or else you trash the Death Cart after playing it.Spoils are a new , self-replenishing supply pile that act as temporary , one-use Gold ( +3 money ) . You get spoils two ways , one by playing Bandit Camp ( +1 card , + actions , +1 spoils ) , or the new attack card , Pillage ( +2 spoils , look @ your opponents ' hands and choose one card to discard ) .Two new supply piles are Urchin ( attack ) and Hermit ( action ) . Trashing either of them allows you to upgrade them into a Mercenary ( attack card ) or Madman ( action ) . That 's the only way to get these powerful cards.There are also Knights , one supply pile of 10 unique male and female knights ( attack cards ) . They trash opponents 's cards ( top two cards from draw pile revealed , opponent chooses which one to trash if it 's value is between 3-6 money , discards the rest ) . But knight cards trash each other if an attacked opponent chooses to trash a revealed knight from his draw pile.Rats are a 20-card supply pile ( +1 card , +1 action ) that let you trash cards but playing them makes you gain another Rats and they can chew through your deck if you 're not careful . That 's because you can trash anything except Rats with this card ! So you 'll need a different card that lets you trash the Rats if you really want to take advantage of it without being overrun . Self-control is another option ... you do n't have to play the Rats just because it 's in your hand , but +1 Card , +1 Action is hard to pass up . . .That 's the basics . You get two awesome new reaction cards , one new Victory card ( worth 1 VP for every 3 silvers in your deck ) , and one cool new Treasure card ( Counterfeit , +1 money , +1 Buy , lets you play a treasure twice then trashes it ) . The rest of the new cards are ( mostly ) action or ( about a half-dozen ) attack cards . Most of the cards in this expansion are incredibly fun , some are a bit fussy and complicated ( at least at first ) , and a few are a bit boring , but experienced players ca n't go wrong with this set . It 's got a bunch of `` must-have '' cards in it like all the big box expansions : Intrigue , Seaside , Prosperity , and Hinterlands . The only non-essential sets are Alchemy and Cornucopia , the two small box expansions , although they both have some fun cards in them.Note that Dark Ages is not a standalone game . It does not include the kingdom and money cards you need to play , so you also need one of these : Dominion Base Cards , Dominion ( the base set ) , orDominion Intrigue ( a standalone expansion ) to play .	1
When my family first played Dark Ages , using the first recommended card combination in the instructions , it was a slow and very low-scoring game . At that point we were n't sure we were going to like it . Since then , though , we 've really enjoyed every game we 've played ( we 're still marching through the suggested games ) . There are a lot of cards in Dark Ages , so we still find ourselves discovering new cards that we have n't played yet . Dark Ages adds some very different dynamics to Dominion that we have n't seen with other expansions . Very much worth the money .	1
I 'll let you read other reviews that go into good detail about what 's in each box , but the point is , dominion is really about how each game is different ; if you just bought base you 'd have a good game but it might feel a bit stale after some time . New cards spice things up.Dark ages in particular has a LOT of different things in it	1
Just played this with my wife and son last night . It is a lot of fun , with more complexity than previous expansions . The quality of the artwork in this expansion is very good , and you get a lot for your money . I would not recommend this to someone new to Dominion , but if you have played the game a lot , this is a must buy . A couple observations based on our initial experience.1 ) To get maximum enjoyment out of this deck , I think you have to carefully choose kingdom cards that complement each other . I would not recommend using the randomizer deck to pick Kingdom cards.2 ) There is more interaction among players with this expansion than in some other sets . Your opponents will try to force you to trash good cards while clogging your hand with weak cards.3 ) Because players will continually be weakening each others ' hands , games with this expansion can last a bit longer.4 ) A few cards , like Death Cart , are extremely powerful and it is a good idea to include them in kingdom card sets used for individual games , or games could really drag on.5 ) We liked the concepts or shelters and ruins , and the focus on the trash pile . They add new dimensions to the game.6 ) The functions and capabilities of individual cards are well-linked to the titles of the cards . I think this expansion is more thematic than previous expansions -- you are really struggling to accumulate those victory points in impoverished `` dark ages . ''	1
I would give this item four starts , but my set did n't include the knight cards , as well as a couple others . These cards age fast , but there are some good cards in the package . A must for any fan !	1
My son received the Dominion/Prosperity/Alchemy box set as a birthday gift , so we have become Dominion junkies . The Dark Ages set is the first additional set I 've ordered , but I have been able to gain familiarity with all the other sets by playing Dominion on-line ( which I learned about from a nifty card included in the Dark Ages box ) .Dark Ages presumes humble beginnings and a & # 34 ; hard times & # 34 ; economy , which is a refreshing change from the ( over- ) abundance of wealth in Prosperity and the mind-boggling complexity of Alchemy ( e.g. , Possession ) . Much of the game action involves trashing cards , and sifting through the trash . We really enjoy the wide variety of new game functions and mechanics ( Knight attacks to trash opponents ' cards , Hermit converting to Madman , Urchin converting to Mercenary , Rogue trash retrievals , etc. ) . As the game unfolds and your deck grows ( or shrinks , depending ) , you really get a feeling of well-deserved progress.Having played on-line with all the various Dominion expansions , I can say without hesitation that games with Dark Ages cards are the most fun , fair , and balanced . Strategies for success can vary widely ( I still ca n't figure out how to make Rats work without destroying my entire deck , but I have seen another player use it to good effect ) . With other sets , experienced players can exploit a single overpowered and under-priced card ( Baker , Bridge , Bishop -- do they all start with 'B ' ? ) to run away with it . Have n't seen anyone do that yet with Dark Ages.Aesthetically speaking , the cards are beautifully depicted and feature some real eye-catching graphics . A few of the Knights are a little hokey ( did they just Photoshop pictures of family members ? ) , but that 's in keeping with Dominion 's occasional tongue-in-cheek humor.I was n't sure whether the Dominion team had already exhausted their imaginations , considering how many expansions preceded this one , but rest assured : Dark Ages brings a lot of new life ( and plenty of death ) to the Dominion franchise .	1
Ok. here is my ranking for Dominion sets:1 . Dominion ( the basic set is a must ) 2 . Seaside ( this expansion hits the table the most in our house ) 3 . Dark Ages ( we have been introducing these cards non-stop , we love the theme , but this is one of the more advanced sets of cards ) 4 . Prosperity ( this expansions cards are way too powerful for my taste , but it introduces some nice elements . we like adding a prosperity card or two to our games ) 5 . Cornucopia - mainly because it adds tournament , which is a great card with a lot of layers6 . Hinterlands - this set has a lot of complicated cards . this does n't mean they are bad ; i like a lot of these cards , but they are a little bit more finicky , and it takes some practice to incorporate these cards effectively into your decks.7 . Alchemy - this is completely irrelevant at this point , because it introduces potions as a currency , which is not used in any successive set . If you buy alchemy , prepare to have games dominated by Alchemy cards . This is an & # 34 ; all or nothing & # 34 ; expansion .	1
Dominion : Dark Ages is the 7th and penultimate expansion for the deck-building game Dominion . Dark Ages is NOT a standalone expansion , meaning you will need Dominion , Dominion : Intrigue , or Dominion : Base Cards to play with this set . That being said , Dark Ages is a very robust expansion with lots to offer . It includes 35 new kingodm decks ( 34 are actions , and 1 is victory ) , making it the biggest expansion of the series . The theme of this set is a bit more doom and gloom than previous releases . As much as Dominion : Prosperity is about wealth and good fortune , this set is about the dregs of society and the squalor it thrives in . Many of the cards ' names fit well with this theme : Beggar , Death Cart , Graverobber , Hermit , Junk Dealer , Rats , Scavenger , Vagrant , etc.As far as new mechanics and new twists to the original game , Dark Ages has plenty of them . First off , it includes Shelters , which are cards that replace the Estates in your starting deck . They 're worthless in terms of victory points , but give you little bonuses that can come into play during the game . For the first time in any set , none of the cards hand out Curses . Instead , a few cards hand out Ruins , which are essentially dead cards in your deck that provide the smallest of benefits . Also , some cards gain you Spoils , which are essentially one-time-use Golds.Looking at the new kingdom decks , the big theme here is the Trash . Some trash your own cards , some trash your opponents ' cards , some trash themselves , some allow you to get things out of the trash ( a first in Dominion ) , and some give you a benefit when they get trashed . Obviously , if you like trashing cards in Dominion , you 'll love this set ; if you do n't like the trashing concept , steer clear of this expansion.What else is new ? Well , one of the kingdom decks - Rats - includes 20 cards , making it the only kingodm deck to include more than 12 cards . Another kingdom deck - Knights - is made up of 10 unique cards . A couple other kingdom decks allow you to gain cards from their own special non-supply piles . This has been done before with Tournament from Dominion : Cornucopia , but the special piles in Dark Ages are full 10-card decks.In short , Dark Ages provides a wealth of variety , mechanics , strategy , and tactics to an already deep game system . If you like Dominion and its expansions , you 'll no doubt like Dark Ages as well . If you 're new to Dominion , this may not be your best choice for getting deeper into the game . Due to its trashing effects and sheer size , its learning curve is a bit steeper than other expansions .	1
I would not say this is the best expansion for Dominion but it is up there . If I were to purchase all the sets again , I would skip the half expansions ( alchemy and cornucopia ) and stick with the full expansions like this one . The one grip about his game is it takes up a ton of space , if you have multiple expansions . They defiantly need to come up with a way to condense the game down in to one or two boxes .	1
This expansion did not call out to me from the shelves of the game store ( like Hinterlands did ) . While it looked somewhat interesting , I just thought the whole ` cards that do something when you trash them ' mechanic was overrated and the theme was depressing . Well , I was wrong . After about a half dozen plays , I can say that Dark Ages is an excellent expansion.While cards like ` Death Cart ' , ` Marauder ' , ` Madman ' , and ` Rats ' are n't exactly a ray of sunshine , they add balance to the Dominion series at a whole . There are some positive cards in here ( i.e . ` Sage ' , ` Rebuild ' ) , but whereas Hinterlands breathed new life into old cards by introducing new ways to play and combine them , Dark Ages treats cards in a utilitarian manner . It also expands ( and inverts ) the dual `` now and later '' balance of cards that began in Hinterlands.As other reviewers have mentioned , this expansion is not aimed at introductory players . Even seasoned players may have to reread some cards ( and the write-ups in the rule book for those cards ) the first few times it 's played , but it soon becomes second nature . There are some cards that are more straightforward , too , creating a nice mix . And , as is the case with my favorite sets ( Intrigue , Hinterlands , and Seaside ) , Dark Ages is excellent by itself and when paired with other sets ( the two recommended games for Dark Ages/Cornucopia are fantastic ) .To conclude , this is a big expansion that was worth the wait for fans of the game ( of which I am one ) . If the increased complexity of Cornucopia and/or Hinterlands leaves you cold , you 'll probably want to avoid this set . But if , like me , you enjoy the challenge and variety that this kind of complexity brings to the game , RUN to the store to get this ! It 's a worthy addition to the Dominion series .	1
The theme of Dark Ages is trashing cards . This expansion is one of the most game-changing expansions as it offers lots of new strategy options , and game mechanics . You also get way more cards in this expansion than any of the others , so it 's a great value . Our family loves to play with Dark Ages cards , especially with Hinterlands .	1
The Dominion game and the expansions are amazing ! They are great card playing that lasts from 40-60 minutes depending on number of players . This expansion was just as a good as the others and the cards are durable and well constructed . The game playing within the cards is also quite interesting . Definitely recommend for the Dominion fan . I would say to get this after getting other expansion packs , though , such as prosperity .	1
First thing you 'll notice when you get this expansion is just how HUGE it is . Each base set comes with 25 distinct kingdom cards . The average expansion ( other than the horrid Alchemy and the rushed Cornucopia ) provided 25 . This set comes with 35 distinct kingdom cards ( one of which -- knights -- is a stack of ten unique cards that are played as a single kingdom stack ) , three alternatives to the three starting estates , and three cards that act like kingdom cards but are only accessed via other cards . This expansion feels mind-blowingly large because it is . For reference , here is a chronological list of expansions and the number of kingdom cards that they came with : Dominion had 25kingdoms ( 2008 ) Intrigue had 25kingdoms ( 2009 ) Seaside had 26kingdoms ( 2009 ) Alchemy had 15kingdoms ( 2010 ) Prosperity had 25kingdoms ( 2010 ) Cornucopia had 13kingdoms ( 2011 ) Hinterlands had 26kingdoms ( 2012 ) Dark Ages has 35kingdoms ( 2012 ) The set introduces a few new types of cardsShelters - these function as alternatives to the three estate cards that players normally start with in their deck . They are slightly less detrimental because they each do something small ( some are +action , some give you things for trashing them , etc ) . There are three different typesRuins - these are like shelters in the fact that they are under-powered cards . They function somewhere between [ estates ] ( which give a small victory point reward but clog up your hand ) and curses ( which both hurt you and clog up your hand ) . They clog up your hand slightly , do n't award victory points , but have some powers in the game . They are usually under-powered compared to kingdom cards in the supply so they do n't hurt as much as a curses but water down the power of your deck . Usually you give them to other players when you pillage or ransack them , but sometimes ( like the [ Death Wagon ] , they come with another kingdom card.Knights- these act like a normal kingdom cards in that they are put out in a stack of 10 , but only the top card is visible and each card in the stack is unique ( each has its own name e.g . [ sir michel ] and power ) . Basically its just ten different kingdom cards stacked as one to add more variability to the game . [ Rats ] - these are traditional action cards in every way except that they self-replicate , eat through your deck ( make you trash a card ) and there are 20 instead of 10 of them . [ Hermit ] / [ Madman ] - When you have [ Hermits ] in your game , you will also pull out a pile of [ Madman ] cards . When you use a [ Hermit ] and fail to buy a card that turn , the [ Hermit ] turns into a [ Madman ] ( you trash the [ Hermit ] and get a [ Madman ] from another stack ( [ Madman ] , [ Mercenary ] and [ Spoils ] are all action or treasure cards that can only be acquired via other cards and do n't count toward the 10 kingdom limit or game-end conditions . Its an interesting mechanic where hermits can go mad and madmen go out in a blaze of glory . [ Urchin ] / [ Mercenary ] - When/if you play with the [ Urchin ] card , you also pull out a stack of [ Mercenary ] cards . [ Mercenaries ] are not part of supply and can only be acquired via an [ Urchin ] . The gist is that if an [ Urchin ] aims high ( takes on multiple tasks/actions in a single turn ] then he becomes a [ mercenary ] ( trash the [ Urchin ] and get a { mercenary ] [ Spoils ] - these are not in the supply and can only be acquired by cards that pillage or ransack others . [ Spoils ] are basically a single-use [ gold ] . Pillaging means that other players discard cards and you put a [ spoils ] card in your discard pile . Ransacking means you give every other player a Ruin card and you gain a [ Spoils ] . When the [ Spoils ] appears in your hand , you use it for +3 coin and instead of discarding it to your discard pile , you discard it back to the [ spoils ] stack from whence it came.When trashed - many of these cards have a power that is only used when the card is trashed ( whether voluntarily as a strategy or involuntarily ) . This adds a lot of interesting strategy particularly with Hinterlands and Seaside.Trash as power - [ Death Cart ] is an extremely powerful card that requires you to trash an action card . If you do n't , you trash it at the end of that turn . Cards like [ Procession ] allow you , amongst other things , to use an action card twice ( a la [ throne room ] , but if you double an action , you trash that card . Both are examples of trash `` powering '' or `` powering up '' cards.So is it fun ? Yes it is . We played three games with Dark-Ages-only sets and two games with sets mixed with Dark-Ages cards last night ( after getting it via two-day shipping and we had a blast . The game plays very well with itself , and played interestingly with other cards . On one of the games , the mix was n't optimal because we had many cards to put things into the trash , but nothing to trash them or get them out of the trash . Overall , the cards are very versatile for almost every setup , and its far from the harshly-limited alchemy expansion , but you will want to play with at least one card that causes players to trash cards ( from any expansion ) and at least one that benefits from being trashed . Pulling cards from the trash is optional , but makes for a fun dynamic.The good+++You get a TON of variety here and a TON of content++Cards feel unique and fun++As with almost all Dominion sets , the card name , card art and card mechanic all work flawlessly together++Unique expansion feel ( poverty , destruction , underground and rebirth ) ++interesting new mechanics introduced++great art+It actually helps make some of the less-viable Cornucopia cards more viableThe bad-some cards are n't as fun without being matched with others ( which could be said about almost any set ) . It 's far from the train-wreck that is Alchemy.-Some cards are a little less inspired-Some games felt a little `` impoverished '' and bogged down . We did n't have a lot of money or our hands were filled with under-powered ruins . It fits the expansion feel well , but I tend to favor the power-play games rather than the games where everyone scrapes along toward victory -- this is totally subjective.Overall , the cards are great , but just a notch below Prosperity , Seaside and Hinterlands . There is just so much variety and content , though . If it was a smaller set like Conucopia , I 'd put it at the bottom of the list with Cornucopia . As it is , this is the single biggest expansion to date and introduces so many new ideas that the sheer quanitity of original content makes up for the quality of some of the cards.1 ) Intrigue ( the better base set ) 2 ) Prosperity ( the highest quality expansion set ) 3 ) Dark-Ages ( the expansion with the most new ideas ) 4 ) Seaside ( the second best in terms of quality ) 5 ) Hinterlands ( the quirkiest and most bizarre but often overpowered ) 6 ) Cornucopia ( a little blah and TINY ) and just skip Alchemy altogether . It 's bad . You 'll never play it .	1
The artwork on the box drew me in . Fortunately , the game turned out to be fun and challenging as well . It is definitely not a game for everyone , but if you enjoy mazes , player interaction , and chess-like thinking , this is a game for you .	1
I played the original Tsuro and loved it , it had quick instructions , quick play , a little strategy , and a little luck . I decided to buy it for my family but after searching around I decided to buy Tsuro of the Sea instead . This was mainly because other reviewers had said you could play both the original style game and the expanded sea one . I always like expansions so I took the bait . The first thing I noticed was that it is awkward to play the original game on this board and the artwork and boat pieces are not as zen as the original . The extra pieces , AKA sea dragons do add an extra element to the game but also drag it out much longer and create a lot of randomness that simple did not exist in the original . In many ways it over complicates a sweet and pure game . If I could do it all over again I would just buy the original Tsuro . I still like the game , I just do n't love it .	1
Tsuro of the Seas : 2-8 Players , Ages 8+ , Average Play Time = 20-40 MinutesThere are a lot of good things to say about Tsuro of the Seas . For one , you can play the original Tsuro on it by branching off a 66 portion of the board and removing all of the duplicate wake tiles . One of the daikaiju tiles can be used as the dragon tile . It takes a little work , but it can be done . Players can also play with the 77 grid without the daikaiju tiles , if they wish . Like Tsuro , this game 's visuals are fantastic and appropriately themed ... everything from the sharp blue colors on the board to the font style of the text in the manual.While the general idea between both games remain the same , the daikaiju tiles definitely add a strategic element that was n't present in the original Tsuro . In Tsuro , I often found that players were playing against themselves as opposed to each other . Each player often branched off on their own for the majority of the game , trying to centralize themselves or put themselves on a path that would guarantee that they had plenty of moves left ahead of them . In the end , it often came down to who had the most moves remaining before they were forced off of the board . Daikaiju tiles can eliminate players regardless of a player 's position on the board , forcing players to operate outside of the normal line of thinking when planning their `` path '' in their head . Daikaiju tiles also destroy wake tiles , reshaping the board on the fly . In some instances , they even extend the length of the game as they give players opportunities to place tiles on spaces that have already been obliterated.As expected , the family got a kick out of Tsuro of the Seas . They got pretty good at the original Tsuro , but had to adjust their strategy a bit when confronted with the daikaiju tiles . Some of them opted to stay along the outside of the board away from everyone else while others tried to stay in the center and away from those deadly edges . Vinnie ( 11 ) was immediately drawn to the art and could n't wait to play . We played with and without the daikaiju tiles ... the former for when we wanted a chaotic game and the latter for when we wanted a semi-structured , old school game of Tsuro . If we want something in between , we 'll start the game off with three daikaiju tiles instead of six in a two to four player game , just as an example . We also came up with variants that gave us `` extra lives '' to prevent early elimination . The game allows us to be flexible in that regard , something I whole-heartedly appreciate as a father to ADHD children.Overall , Tsuro of the Seas keeps the saga going superbly . Like its predecessor , it 's easy and quick to play , making it a fun game to bring out on family game night . For those of you who already own Tsuro and are questioning whether or not they should drop money on a new , similar product , my advice is to take a look at how often you play Tsuro . If Tsuro has been sitting on your shelf for months without being touched , then you may not want to make the investment . However , if you get a lot of mileage out of Tsuro and want to mix things up a bit with a slightly different version , then you ca n't go wrong with Tsuro of the Seas .	1
This is a quality game that 's perfect when you want to get a strategy game in , but do n't have a ton of time ( it only takes about a half hour ) . I also really like that it can accommodate anywhere from 2 to 8 players , and the theme is pretty darned cool , too . It 's quick to learn , and you can teach it to others easily . The components are quite good , with a quality board , ship pieces , and game tiles . My only minor criticism is that board game veterans will not find much depth here , but that 's not the intention of Tsuro of the Seas . Four stars !	1
I 've been getting back into board games recently , and I saw this one played on TableTop ( google it if you like games ! ) , so I decided to pick it up.When I opened the box , the quality of the components really blew me away . The little plastic ships are super detailed , and the path tiles are thick and shiny and just feel good to hold . The manual is elegant ( and quite thorough ) . Everything physical about this game is seriously top notch.It 's a very 'light ' game , where you only need to make the decision of which of your hand of tiles to play , to guide your ship.With the standard rules ( i.e . dragons ) , the strategy elements will only come into play if you survive until much of the board is filled in . It 's too dependent on chance for my taste . I 'll still play it , but I usually lose through sheer bad-luck , and that gets a bit old . That being said , it works well with groups that enjoy chance heavy games . We actually created a house-rule where if a new dragon comes into play , it ca n't land right on top of someone ( we just re-roll ) . That diminishes the 'lame bad luck ' deaths to some degree.Alternately , you can play without the dragons , and it becomes SIGNIFICANTLY less random ( there 's still chance in the tiles you draw ) .	1
In spite of my aversion to abstracts , I love the elegance and simplicity of a good multiplayer game of Tsuro . Tsuro adds to the basic pathmaking game through the use of randomly moving seamonsters . I do admit it adds to the fun chaos of the early game , but since the monsters clear out previous paths they can actually extend the endgame since there is no longer a hard limit to the end . Rolling dice to move the monsters also slightly slows the game . Overall , the monsters do n't add enough to the game to make up for what they take away . Thankfully , it 's trivial to play the base game with this set so there is no reason to stay away from this version if you do not yet own a copy of Tsuro .	1
Read the dikiju movement ahead of time . The instructions for that section are a little confusing but once you understand it , only take 2 minutes to explain it during the game . This is a good sequel to the game Tsuro , and instead of the players being the giant monsters , they are ships trying to avoid them . Note that rows/columns 3 and 4 are the same , this is by design , do n't let it trip you up when placing dikiju on the board , simply roll again to avoid doubling up.Quick rundown of dikiju movement : At the beggining of your turn , roll both dice , if they equal 6,7,8 the dikiju move , if not , place your wake tile and go to the next person . If you rolled a 6,7,8 then roll one die , if it is a 6 , place a new dikiju on the board same as you did to set up the game . If it is not a 6 , then move the dikiju according to the number in the corner with gold having priority over blue 1-5 . Move in direction of the arrow that number is on each dikiju tile or rotate it in place if that number is in the corner . They do n't move as much as you would initially think . They add a great element to the game and help change the board during the game as the dikiju will eat/erase wake tiles and other dikiju . Younger kids can get the hang of this just as quick but it 's still a good game for adults too !	1
I had the original Tsuro for years . But , this one can be played like the old Tsuro if you like . Plus , there are other features that can be added when you get bored of the regular Tsuro gameplay . The daikaiju really add another layer of fun to the game . I gave away my Tsuro copy after purchasing this version.The only thing I do n't like that much is the boat pieces , but this is a purely aesthetic problem I have with the game . These pieces are too large and unwieldy compared to the ones used in Tsuro . They also seem to be made out of the same colored plastic as the original Tsuro pieces . This would not be a problem , except that the color scheme of everything else has changed . These pieces clash with the cool-color scheme of the board and the cards . But , this minor gripe of mine does not affect gameplay . It is still very fun and I still think it deserves 5 stars for that .	1
We have a 3 year old son who always gets left out of family game night since he 's really not able to play most games with us . This game says it 's for 5+ , but he was able to understand ( with teaching through cause and effect ) pretty quickly how to play . We laughed each time the boat tipped and spilled the penguins ( who are really cute , by the way ) .The kids had fun figuring out where to place their next pirate penguin to try to make us tip it with ours . The only issue we had was that a few times it tipped because we bumped it . That just made us play more carefully.They 've asked for it at least every other night since it came and we took it out . I 'm pleased with this because it keeps their attention , teaches them and is really just fun for them.This is a great product . I noticed that another reviewer mentioned that the penguins are all the same . This did n't really bother me because a few paint markers will customize them quite easily .	1
My seven year old son enjoys playing this game with the family . Though the box says 5 and up , I think many four years olds would also enjoy testing their skills . This is harder than it looks and though play can go quickly it makes for a fun short few games prior to bedtime .	1
The thing I like most about 'Do n't Rock The Boat ' is its simplicity . The older children get involved in the logistics of it as well as in making things happen if it gets too calm . The younger ones just enjoy marching the cute little penguins around . There is plenty of room for creativity . A Zip-lock bag is going to come in handy . The game comes with 3 masts , a 2-piece water wave , and 16 `` Pirate Penguins '' all the same size and shape , a very nice size and shape to play with . I plan to give ours individual identities by putting initials or designs on their fronts in different colors . This is the kind of game that we seem to spend hours playing with together . I suspect the penguins will outlive the masts . Over time they may end up in a doll house occasionally . That 's okay too . They 're adorable .	1
I have to say this is about the most straight-forward game you can find . The rules , starting from youngest , each person puts a penguin on until they fall off . The one placing the penguin that causes the boat to tip loses . That 's it . It has all the simplicity that makes a great college drinking game ; simple rules and some physical dexterity.We played this game a few times and it did hold my kids ' attention for a while . It was nice that it was accessible and enjoyable for a 6 year old , an 11 year old , and a 44 year old . It is good for any age group . The game pieces are simple to assemble and seem to be durably built , all you need to supply is gravity.Pros+ Very simple Game Play+ Good for a range of ages+ Well and Ruggedly constructedCons- one of our penguins was mis-cast so he leans and is hard to placeSummaryThis game is so simple and basic there is little to say about it . It is a decent fun game that anyone can pick up instantly . Some small education value as it teaches balancing skills , but mostly just a mindless physical challenge of a small bit of thought , dexterity and daring .	1
My kindergartner adored this game . When it came out of the box , she happily played it for over an hour.The pirate ship balances on an ocean blue triangle platform , and the object of the game is to get your penguin pirates on to the ship without tipping it over . This game requires your child to think about weight , balance , and early geometry skills . It requires an engineering thought process to figure out how to put the penguins in place without ending the game.It can be played with multiple players , or played solo.My only request for future versions of this game is to make the penguin pirates unique . In this edition , they are all black and white , with no individual personalities . It would add a dimension of imaginative play to have the pirates be characters themselves.The details of the pirate ship were spot on . The deck was textured to look and feel like planks . The sides of the boat were glossy and attractive with brassy trim.Very satisfied with this game . It 's a keeper , and a great toy to give as a gift for birthday parties !	1
Do n't Rock the Boat is a very simple game , but one with enough challenge that there is some good repeat value . The premise could n't be much less complicated : place the boat on the balance pole and then take turns placing penguins on the boat without tipping it over . I was pleasantly surprised with the physics of the game , as the boat is quite `` tippy '' and you really have to be careful not to knock it over . My 7 year old son and I have played many rounds and we both enjoy the game despite our 36 year age difference . Adults will soon recognize that playing super conservatively can sometimes result in a draw , with all of the penguins starting off as close to the center of balance as possible and keeping them as close to it as possible for the whole game . I was able to level the playing field a bit , however , simply by taking the first move and putting the first penguin far enough from the center of balance that the boat started off with a bit of a tilt . That keeps things challenging and increases the likelihood that someone will in fact rock the boat before all is said and done.The game plays very quickly , with rounds lasting no more than a couple of minutes each , so it 's great for a few quick rounds before bed or for times when you do n't want to start something that will take a long time to finish . My 3 year old daughter found it too tough and got frustrated quickly , so I 'd recommend this for around 5 or 6 and up depending on your child 's motor skills . All in all a surprisingly good game that will challenge a broad range of players and which offers pretty good replay value especially given it 's simplicity . Recommended for families looking for something everyone can enjoy together !	1
Do n't Rock the Boat is along the same lines as Pick Up Stix , Do n't Break the Ice , and Jenga . The object of the game is to place as many penguins on the ship as possible without the ship toppling over . My son spent hours trying to balance the penguins and then laughing when they all fell down . I found it interesting how the shape of the penguin and their hats gave my son more ideas on how to hook them on so they would not fall . When he got tired of using the game as directed , he took the boat off the `` wave '' that makes it rock and played with the pirates and pirate ship separately . Besides the missing pirates ( do n't pieces always get lost when kids are having fun with a game ? ) this game has stood the test of time . My son is really rough with toys and he 's played with this game everyday for a month . The game gets extra points for keeping his attention so long !	1
This pirate boat is a balance game . The basic premise is that you balance little penguin pirates on the ship to try keep it from tipping over and dumping all the pirates . The plastic ship sits carefully balanced on the base , so that it tips quite easily . Kids learn how to place their penguins carefully and deliberately , so it teaches both hand-eye coordination and also helps them grasp the basic concepts of balance and counter-balance . But there is n't quite enough to the game . The whole game is putting penguins on the boat until it tips . When it tips , game over . That can take as little as one turn , then , all done . One penguin too far from the center of the ship ( more than a couple of inches ) can tip it over quite easily . I think coming up with a way to have it tip a little less easily would have improved the game . Obviously , you play many times , taking turns , but you 'll need to adapt it , say by coming up with some type of scoring system , in order to keep older kids engaged . My kids have also really enjoyed just playing with the pieces , so that has been an added bonus . So this game does have some potential as a family-time game for play with young children . It is based on a simple concept , and that is a good thing for young game players . And the ship and penguins are fun . So it does pretty well at what it does , but do n't expect too much .	1
Sometimes the simplest toys and games are the most fun . By placing weighted penguins on a pirate ship that 's sitting on a pole , your child slowly learns the science of balance . As my son said , it 's similar to Jenga , but it 's a lot more fun for younger kids . The penguins are made from sturdy rubber , and the ship and the wave it sits precariously on is made from plastic . Overall good quality , challenging , and fun . Perfect rainy day game .	1
Our five-year-old can get easily frustrated with the balancing of the ship . However , I know that in time with practice she will get better at this game . I like how it teaches some beginning physics and how balance plays in strategy . The items are very durable and we enjoy playing the game .	1
My 6 year old son and I played this shortly after it arrived to us , and we both enjoyed it a lot ! The object is simple , and similar to the game `` Jenga ; '' put as many pirate penguins on the deck of the wobbly ship , teetering on a small pole , until the ship loses balance and they all topple off ! This game is fun because the penguins are cute , and it 's easy to get a few on the ship , but you really have to pay attention to balance or else you will lose ! And this is where the educational value of the game comes into play . It 's a very good lesson for kids to explore where to put things , and see the effects of the placement of the penguins on how the wobbly ship moves.I would definitely recommend this game for some fun family time , or as a gift at a birthday for a kid under 7 years old . The only negative is that after about 20-30 minutes , it gets sort of repetitive . But most games and boardgames do . All in all , a solid product !	1
Patch Products ' `` Do n't Rock The Boat '' is simple yet fun . It 's an excellent game for youngsters under the age of eight , but I do n't know if kids older than that would enjoy it very much.The concept behind the game is simple . All you do is balance the pirate ship on the `` wave '' and each player takes a turn putting one of their `` pirate penguins '' on the ship . They can place the penguins anywhere they want , from stem to stern , and even pile them on the masts and in the crow 's nest . The first player that `` rocks the boat '' and knocks at least one penguin out of the ship is the loser.When you open the box you get a wave with a small rod that inserts into it . There 's also a pirate ship with three easy to attach masts and a pack of sixteen pirate penguins . Simply place the ship on the rod that inserts into the top of the wave and you 're ready to go.My five year old son laughed the entire time we played . He adapted to the game rather quickly , and begin to think out each move for a longer amount of time as he began to understand the balancing act of the game.Overall , this is a brilliant game . All of the penguins looks and is weighted alike , so there 's no advantage of having one certain penguin over another.This is a very fun game for very young children , and they can learn a lot from it as well ! Highly recommended .	1
The versatility of this game struck me immediately . I like that the toy can be played with independent of the game . Just put the boat on the floor and play with the pirate penguins . As far as the fame goes , it 's an easy concept that teaches kids about balance in a fun way . And who does n't love pirates ? I could n't give it five stars because the boat/iceburg are really cheap and flimsy . My son popped the floor of the boat out trying to put on one of the masts . The masts also do n't fit very well . It does n't take much for them to fall down.All in all , it 's a great gift idea for all ages .	1
I played this game with my mom ( I am 29 ) and we had quite a blast , especially since I kept losing . The object of the game is simple , place all your penguins on the pirate ship without tipping it so all the penguins fall off . It is harder than it sounds , although once you get the hang of it the game is very amusing . We only managed to get all the penguins ( 16 ) on once . The game seems quite durable and if you are looking for a challenge start with the ship slightly off kilter for a tougher game . I think any person over the age of 5 ( which the starting recommended age for this ) would have fun trying to balance this ship . The other thing about this is you can actually play it by yourself and see how many you can put on the ship without it tipping . One thing I do agree is that several reviewers have said the game gets old after a half hour but I think when you pull it out a week or so later and play it again , you will have just as much fun as the first time . I highly recommend this game for anyone who loves penguins or pirates or pirate penguins .	1
This is a really cute game and is sure to make your little ones laugh . This game is along the same premise as Do n't Spill the Beans . You have to place a penguin on the ship and make sure you do n't place it where it will make the ship tip and topple the peguins . The younger kids love to simply place the penguins as quickly as possible , hoping to rock the boat and watch the penguins dive overboard . The older kids have fun strategically placing their penguins while trying to take up space so the next player will rock the boat . It is definitely repetitive , but kids 3-5 will love playing it over and over , and the 6-8 age group will enjoy trying to just trying to win . I highly recommend this game .	1
I had originally written a review for this toy when I received it a few months ago , but it seems to have disappeared , and I was hoping to update it now that we 've had it for a while . My five year old grandson still loves this game , and we play often . I was afraid it would lose it 's cute appeal but actually he is getting very good at it , and is figuring out how to balance the boat , a good skill . It does have small pieces , so not for the very young , but any child over three would probably have a lot of fun with this .	1
Ahoy , fellow mateys , we have a task of balancing a motley crew of cutish , pirate penguins , of all things , on a rickety , precariously tilted ship . Can you believe it ? ? Yes , you will , once you play this game . Obviously , our kids , 8 & 6 , love the penguins . They make up their own games , when we 're not playing the official one , and have pretend adventures with the black and white bird crew.The set-up and game playng are simple . Take turns trying to balance penguins and ship . Practice improves play , and we try to keep it lighthearted and not frustrating . Actually , the kids seem to prefer it when they do spill everything . Lots of laughs , not a whole lot of education here , maybe some fine motor skills.Also , we recommend handicapping the better or more mature players , e.g. , use only your non-dominant hand , face away and stretch your arms from behind your back while looking over your shoulder , stand on one leg ( Walking the Plank Method ) and balance a book on you head while placing the penguins , and for severe test of skills or punishment- wear a blindfold . The options are practically endless , but let the little ones have a fair shot , i.e. , let them win ! Fun , simple game , goes well with Pizza , Popcorn , and watching or reading , Mr. Popper 's Penguins .	1
I remember the old version of `` Do n't Rock the Boat '' , which was called `` Tip the Ship '' . The old game had a put together cardboard ship and pirates on stands , which you needed to place on the ship without them tipping the ship over . This newer version now includes a large plastic ship with pirate penguins . The idea is the same , as you need to place the penguins on the wobbly boat without them falling . You do n't want to be the first player that knocks the penguin overboard . I think the older version may have been a little easier to play , however , all in all I liked the game.This game works on fine motor dexterity , problem solving and visual spatial skills . Your impulsive children may become frustrated as it does take more of a steady hand than some of the reviews have indicated . This game can also be used for positioning , reach and release and as part of an obstacle course ( bring penguin through a maze and place on the ship ) . I am satisfied with the durability and usability of this product and found it to be a hit at my school setting . This game can be graded up or down depending on the age of the child . Target age would seem to be 5-8 .	1
My three year old ca n't really play this , but the five and six year old love it . And also the 46 year old . I 'm not much of a game guy , to be honest , so it 's a treat to find games both I and the kids enjoy.I was worried it would n't balance well , be too tippy ; but it 's fine , not finicky at all . The boat deck does pop off if you 're a little rough , but it snaps back on easily . After playing with it for a couple hours it does n't show any signs of falling apart , so I 'm feeling good about the durability.The online video shows penguins sitting out on the yardarms , but I ca n't figure out how to do that without putting two penguins down at once so we changed the rules of the game to permit this.It 's a lot of fun trying to get all the penguins onto the ship without spilling , and it 's a lot of fun when they spill . We usually play four or five rounds , maybe ten minutes , before tempers rise too high to continue . Sometimes the kids play on their own .	1
I thought the game might be a little too hard for our little kids , and in fact , they complained at first about it being too hard . Their penguins kept falling off the ship.The concept for the game is simple enough like a number of similar object-balance games out there , but that does n't mean that it 's easy to play.After a few rounds , the kids got the hang of it , although it was still pretty tough to keep those penguins on there.We devised a few different ways to play ( adding to your pile any that fell off , etc . ) .It was a fun game . It was n't the easiest to get it back in the box for storage . Just take a look at how everything is packed and then try to put it back in that way .	1
A cute game and a nice remake of the old do n't tip the boat game . My 4 year old is obsessed with pirates and all things pirate . To say he loved this game is an understatement . The object of the game is to get your penguins on the boat which is balanced on a `` wave '' , without causing the pirate ship to tip over . It teaches the kids about balance as they learn how to place the penguins in different positions to keep the boat balanced . It is n't a game you are going to play for hours on end , but it nice for a short session , and it does get played several times a week .	1
This is a quick , fun game . It is easy to play , but not so easy to win as you learn how to balance the boat . But even my youngest child keeps wanting to play again because the thought tends to be , `` I can do better next time . '' And since the next time comes so quickly , it maintains the fun , whilst giving hope of doing better even when you lose.The parts all seems sturdy enough to last awhile and it is a game we get out when we want a short , easy to play , fun game . And the penguins are cute too .	1
If you plan to play this game with your kids and counting on showing off your mad skills , I suggest you practice a bit ahead of time , because it 's not easy to keep the balance on the penguin ship.Game for 1This game can also be fun for one player . I played on my own trying to figure how many I pirate-penguins I can stack on the boat and it is just addictive - I kept trying over and over again . It 's a great challenge and I honestly wish I had this kind of game growing up , because being the only child I spent plenty of time waiting for my parents to play with me.Great Game for the Little HandsThis game could also be a lot of fun for the younger kids . I took the wave out and positioned the boat on the flat surface . My 3 year old loved stacking the penguins on the boat . It is easier for the little hands and still lets them practice their stacking skills . It is great for developing hand-eye coordination . However , this game is suggested for kids 5+ and includes small parts ( aka penguins ) .Patch Products Do n't Rock The Boat	1
The kids are a 5 year old boy and his 6 year old sister . When this game arrived I told them to look at the photo on the box , read what they could of the directions and tell me how many stars we should give the rating . Both told me 5 stars . They put it together by them selves . Luke was so happy that the directions say the youngest goes first , as usual with games of this sort . We play on the kitchen table because the support for the ship is a little delicate . One plastic dowel on a plastic wave . I 'm sure it would snap if they were playing on the floor . Not to mention my huge mastiff dog , waiting with bated breath to gobble all the little black and white pirate penguins . You must place the penguins standing up on the ship , if they fall down on board , keep playing , if one falls off the ship the game is over and the person going before the one who caused the ship to tip is the winner . So , the kids have to focus , remember who 's turn it is and we added the rule that they have to talk pirate talk while placing the pieces . Ahoy matey , I 'll make you walk the plank if you tip my ship . It was fun and I was happy that I did n't have to spend 20 minutes trying to figure out the rules . It 's a simple , fun game.Update , we are in the aftermath of hurricane Sandy , the grandpa , 5 and 6 year old , dad and an aunt and uncle are all playing the game and having a blast . I 've given one more star to make it five star . The adults want to start playing for a buck a penguin that falls off , but we settled for m & m ; 's .	1
Gup X is a fantastic product . It becomes three different vehicles and it can shoot the slimes ( green circles ) and it has different voice recording . It is simply an awesome toy . If your son loves the octonauts like mine does he will love Gup X Playset .	1
While I would n't recommend the Gup X for water adventures , this Octonaut toy is a whole lot of fun . The picture does n't show it but there are actually three large pieces which merge to form the Gup X . There is a tiny wheeled torpedo shaped sit in ride for Barnacles , the main compartment with wheels that shoots the 4 slime discs and talks little Captain Barnacles sayings , and then there is the front piece which comes off to form a sort of & # 34 ; floating & # 34 ; compartment ( no wheels ) .The little accessories that come with are great as with most of the Octonaut toys . I 'm always please with them though the few that are n't water-safe are confusing for the 3 y.o .	1
My sons second favorite Xmas present . Flipped s*** when he seen everything this toy can do . Great quality . So many things it can haul and do . Interchangeable parts . Great shipping . 5 Stars hands down .	1
I purchased this toy at the request of my grandson for his 5th birthday . He knows every Octonaut character and vehicle by name ; plays with these toys for hours on end , with his imagination on & # 34 ; high & # 34 ; speed ! The toys are well made ; stand up to hours of childhood playtime .	1
This toy is impossible to find ! My 3 year old is obsessed with Octonauts so when it came up for amazon lightening deal it was a no brainer ! It is very big - much bigger than the picture looks - and there are lots of pieces to go with it as well . My only complaint is I wish Fisher Price would give us some other characters rather than Barnacles in every single vehicle configuration ! !	1
This was the best Christmas gift he got ... ..he loves Octonauts and this comes with fun pieces for him to share with others or just play himself	1
My son is an Octonaut fan and was soo excited to get the Gup X . Its very cool . He loves that it comes apart and you can play with each ship/vehicle separately . Great addition to his Octonaut collection . So far he has played with it every day since xmas . We got it on sale so the price was great and quick delivery .	1
We never found the Gup x in a store and our son wanted santa to bring it . Like the others the windshield will not stay on it very well but overall it holds up pretty well .	1
My son loves his Gup X . He plays with all of his Gups every night . They are all neat in their own ways . This one is no different !	1
By now , Munchkin has become something of an icon in the non-electronic gaming world . The game play is relatively straightforward : ( 1 ) collect cards that give you points , ( 2 ) flip over cards that depict monsters , ( 3 ) compare your points to the `` level '' of the monster , ( 4 ) defeat the monster or attempt to escape ( depending on the results of your points comparison ) .Each card contains its own set of rules that affect game play , so each card contains ( often substantial ) text.The game is fairly flexible in terms of the number of players it can accommodate , but somewhere between 3-5 is probably best . If you stick to those numbers , a game will usually take around 30-45 minutes.This game can be played as a standalone ( apocalypse-themed ) set and is also compatible with any of the ( many ) Munchkin expansions , so a player may consistently add new cards to the deck in order to breathe new life into the game.Overall , the play is very fun , portable , fast-paced , and often amusing . Having said that , these cards were n't as clever as I was hoping . The game is still quite enjoyable , but I was hoping for a few more laughs.APPROPRIATE AUDIENCE : Hardcore gamers will enjoy this as a `` warm-up '' between their more complicated gaming sessions . It 's a very useful tool for introducing newcomers to these kinds of games ( although Fluxx or Current Number of the Beast are maybe even better for this purpose ) .Finally , this particular set is ( obviously ) apocalypse themed -- in other words , if the player does n't enjoy ( or wo n't understand ) Mad Max and doomsday prepper jokes , you are better off getting a different set of Munchkin cards ( Star Munchkin for sci-fi fans , Conan Munchkin for fantasy fans , etc ) .OVERALL SCORE : B- ( at this point , the game is too venerable to consider anything less , despite the cards not being as humorous as past sets ) .	1
Great game to play with friends . The illustrations is what gets to me . Very high replay value and great for friends and family . Witty jokes within the cards makes it special .	1
We have been using this as a stand alone game , but it can be melded with other munchkin sets . We have to flip a coin to see which game we will play first on Game Night.We highly recommend Munchkin Apocalypse !	1
This is the hardest version of Munchkin we have played so far . The 4 of us barely got to level 2 after a very long time of play ... . that being said - we loved it ! Broke in a newbie and he had a blast . The addition of seals adds another layer that can be easily forgotten ... monsters get +1 for each that is open !	1
I enjoyed this munchkin game since it adds new ways to win the game as well as new classes and monsters .	1
Munchkin Apocalypse , much like Munchkin : Cthulhu , is different then the core set , Booty , Star , and the Western themed Munchkin , because of the changes to the dynamics to win . However unlike Cthulhu , is the uncompromising constant battle , not just against other players , like normal for Munchkin , but also against the game itself.Munchkin turn play summary : & # 34 ; All players are given cards , and can put down items to represent two hands , one pair of feet , one body , and one head . Players can take class and race cards and place them as their character 's skill set.Players kick down the door ( draw a door card face up ) and then deal with the repercussions . If the card is a monster , players must face the monster . If it is a curse , players must resolve the curse . If the player did not encounter a monster , player may then loot the room ( draw a face down door card ) . If the player chooses to not loot the room , they may look for trouble ( take a monster card from their hand and fight it ) .Combat nets players treasures , which can give better weapons , and levels . Players win the game by getting to the tenth level. & # 34 ; In Apocalypse players still draw one card face up , fight the monster , but now items , curses , and monsters can all cause seals to open . Seals are by far some of the most diabolical game play dynamics Munchkin has come up with for some time . Every open seal gives each monster a plus one , but on top of that , lots of them have effects that give much more destructive effects . Worse then the Dungeon cards of Munchkin , the Seals of Apocalypse can severely devastate a player.Whats worse is , that while that 's only one effect , the game instantly ends at 7 seals . Leaving all the Munchkins to fend for themselves against the full wrath of the apocalypse . All the gold , levels and social pandering for naught . The only thing that can save the Munchkins , is their horded stuff . The player with the highest combat strength ( levels not included ) wins the day.WHAT DID I LIKE ABOUT THE GAME : I love the seals , the fact that items and and monsters can open them . I like how certain classes can sacrifice to close seals.The game plays amazingly , and works in the seals to a perfect degree.WHAT DID I DISLIKE ABOUT THE GAME : I do n't like the difficulty of this game . While it is slated to allow for beginners , it falls short where other Munchkin games do not . This is not the first game I would play with a beginner Munchkin Player , but eventually they will play it and love it.WHO IS THIS GAME DESIGNED FOR ? Games make by gamers for gamers . This game is it , but unlike other Munchkin games , I recommend you try original before you bust out Apocalypse flavor.RATING ! 7.3 out of 8 . Munchkin , End of the World , Four Little Horsies of the Apocalypse . You had me at Horsies .	1
I like that it 's more than just a theme-change . All Munchkin sets are a lot of fun but what I really like about this one is the addition of & # 34 ; seals of the apocalypse. & # 34 ; There 's a new small deck of cards that adds a little environment to follow ( like dungeon expansions for Munchkin , Munchkin Cthulhu , and Munchkin Zombies ) . The catch is that when there are 7 seals open , the game ends and the most powerful munchkin ( not highest level ) wins the game . The down side of this rule is you may have someone playing that is purposely opening as many seals as possible because he has a ton of items in use . ... but that is very munchkinly and kind of the object of the game . Overall , it 's a lot of fun and one of my favorite Munchkin sets . Also , I have the Mars Attacks booster that adds 2 more seals and 13 other cards . I suggest getting that too .	1
No problems here . My daughter loves her Lambie although she is over priced lol Lambie helped her be a real Doc McStuffins for halloween .	1
Our granddaughter loves Lambie . She sleeps with her . We purchase lambie , stuffy , and doc mcstuffins . She likes lambie best . We would recommend this item .	1
My child loves this toy ! She talks , and has that adorable Lambie voice and is big enough to cuddle back !	1
My 3yr old got this for Christmas and she adores it . It instantly trumped all other stuffed toys , especially since she 's a Doc McStuffins fan . It 's made well . Everything is solidly attached . It says a few phrases ( mostly about hugging ) and the volume is not too loud which is nice for a parent 's ears . There is a small rattle in one of the feet , again not too loud . It 's a great size for a toddler , not too small . I trust having it around my younger child since all the pieces are sewn on well . We 're considering getting her a `` Stuffy '' soon because this one is a hit !	1
Lambie stopped talking after only two days ! I took out the voice box and realized the wires were poorly attached to the button in her hand . Toys r us reviews are bad for the same reason . Do n't waste your money , especially these marked up prices ! UpdateI contacted the company and they offered to ship me a new one right away . She said they realized there was a large batch that were n't working right . We 've had the new lambie for two months and she 's still working great . Thrilled with the customer service !	1
First and foremost , I must post the disclaimer that my daughter is a Doc McStuffins FANATIC ! There really is n't much to say other than my daughter is in love with the fact `` da really real Lambie lives my house . ''	1
bought this for my 3 year old . arrived in perfect condition . has the same voice as the tv show and is floppy just like the show . no problems with the & # 34 ; neck & # 34 ; as in other reviews . very happy with purchase , fast shipping .	1
THIS WAS ONE OF THE FAVORITES , HE TALKS AND THAT WAS JUST THRILLING FOR THE LITTLE ONES TO HEAR . AND HE 'S SO COLORFUL AND TRUE TO DESIGN OF THE TV SHOW STUFFY . GREAT PRETEND TOY	1
My daughter loves Stuffy ! It is supper cute and made much better than Lambie ! We bought several Doc McStuffins items ... the Doc Kit ( love it ! ) and DVD ( Love it ) ... Lambie fabric is not strong enough and tore at the neck seem ; the voice box also stopped working . So disappointing when it is a Christmas gift for you child ! Stuffy ... well he is made with stronger fabric and is still talking up a storm !	1
He is a Christmas present but I know he is going to be greatly loved . She has the small little character with her other Disney characters and he has a wonderful time with Mickey , Minnie and the crowd .	1
This is a nice set of trains for a great price . It came out to about $ 5 per train , which is a great value .	1
I got these for $ 19.99 and at the time of this review they are $ 22.99 so pretty close . And seems like they are usually about $ 10 a piece separately so pretty good deal . Yes they are n't the most well known or colorful trains so if you are looking for the ones your kid knows or a bright recognizable one then you might want to pass . My 2 year old does seem to go for his Thomas and Percy first but they are also the smaller metal ones so that might be it as well . I bought the Conductor Carl track100 Pieces of Bulk Wooden Train Track by Conductor Carl . Compatible with All Major Brands Including Thomas The Tank Engineand they work on this perfectly . I was n't sure if i liked them at first bc they were n't metal like his other ones but they are well made and he is playing with them daily . I just wish they sold Thomas , Percy , Edward , and the more famous ones together with this deal . But a great addition or quick start to a collection .	1
Two year old loves these characters , this particular pack is from a video that he has watched at least 50 times . He absolutely loves this pack . Collectibles .	1
My son loves the movie and these trains were a perfect gift after watching it . I ordered them while they were on sale . They 're just like most of the other Thomas and Friends wooden trains . They hold up well and are great to play with .	1
I ordered this for my son to go with the green mountain mystery and he loves playing and watching his moving . This set was really hard to find . The price was great and shipping was on time .	1
This is a nice set and a great value . My son really wanted Luke but since they have not introduced a wooden railway Luke yet these had to do . He plays with them but seems sort of off Thomas right now . If your kid is heavy into Thomas and love Blue Mountain Mystery they will enjoy this set .	1
Every Thomas train that I have ever bought is still being used by my grandchildren . They love them , therefore , so do I , it keeps them busy and entertained .	1
Bought this for my son and he loves them . Great price for the entire set , hard to five 5.00 a piece Thomas trains . Good Thomas quality .	1
My grandson loves all of the Thomas trains , but these are not his favorites . He was even willing to leave them at Grandma 's house which he never wants to do .	1
I have 2 boys , 6 and 1 that love this ship . It has lots of places to enter and exit , a basketball hoop , a large sail , and best of all it is easy to put away . Jake and the Neverland pirates are a mainstay in this household and wow does this beat them just sitting and watching the show . Imagination galore a treat for anyone who plays with it . My husband cant stop using the basketball hoop . lol	1
Larger than I thought it would be . 2 toddlers could easily fit inside . Basketball hoop is a strange add on , but my 4 yr old granddaughter loved it . Easy to set up and put away . Material is definitely like the shopping bag fabric , but do n't think it will tear easily . Only reason it did not rate a 5 star is that it is a little flimsy , which means it moves very easily . Some small Velcro bean bags would add a little weight to the base and make it a little more stable . Tent stakes or similar would work great for the yead . However , glad I purchased it . Worth the money , and when she saw it , her smile was huge and priceless .	1
My 2 1/2 year old son received this play tent for Christmas and was overjoyed on Christmas morning ! However , since then has rarely played with it - mostly because when he crawls in and out of the & # 34 ; ship & # 34 ; it falls over on him . It is not as sturdy as I would like but still a fun Jake thing for him to play with when his friends come over and it will be an awesome addition to his Pirate birthday party . Overall I feel that this was a worth while purchase .	1
My son is a huge Jake and the Neverland Pirates fan . I knew he had to have this when he saw it . He is n't spending as much time in it as I had hoped but probably because its just him most of the time . Honestly I have no idea what the basketball hoop has to do with a pirate ship ? ? ? But he doesnt mind .	1
This ship is super cute . I preface this comment with I WOULD buy it again if I had to make the decision to buy it again . However , it is a thin material and the kids seem to have figured out the front 3 velcros on the point of the ship come apart easily . I pick this ship up from a flat on the floor state , no less than 3x a day and put it back together . However , it is as easy as just velcroing the 3 pieces again . It is functional and serves its imaginary and play purpose , it 's probably just not as durable as it could have been had it been made with a different material .	1
my son got this christmas and he loves it . I love that its easy to put away when its not be used . ii really like this playhut and I recomend it ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .	1
We purchased this for our nephews ( 3 brothers ) and from what Gramma tells us it was a full success . Let 's just hope it lasts more than a year .	1
Thank you , Amazon Prime ! This gift was torn open in our living room by 9 or 10 of our grandkids . The birthday boy ( and assorted others ) promptly started to set up the ship , only to find it kept getting bigger and bigger ! Finally , we hoisted its sail outside . After pictures were taken of & # 34 ; how many cousins can fit in the pirate ship , & # 34 ; it provided hours of fun for all ... .mostly for the adults who watched from inside .	1
Great play tent , but especially great for any little Jake fan . My son loves it and keeps all of his pirate stuff , jake dolls and a blanket in it . Very happy with purchase .	1
This is for my boys from santa . It came quick and on schedule.I 'm excited to put it up and see how it is ! Very pleased !	1
This worked really well as part of our treasure hunt for our pirate party but it 's a little too young for my 5 and 7 yr olds . I think if they were younger and we left it set up all the time , they 'd be all over it . I still ca n't figure out how to fold it up to put in back in the box , but I got it flat , so it fits nicely in the back of our toy closet !	1
Good bang for your buck . My 5 and 1 year old love it . The older kids use the basket ball hoop and the little guys climb in and out and think it is neat . Any pirate lover will enjoy !	1
Its much bigger than the picture shows ! Took up almost our whole living room which the boys loved on Christmas morning . It was n't quite as sturdy as I 'd hoped but we have had other tents like this so I expected that . You ca n't really throw the basketball at the net without it falling over but the point it to play pirate anyway .	1
I bought this because my 3 year old kept dismantling all the couch cushions to build a & # 34 ; pirate ship & # 34 ; out of them . He loves this and has had a lot of fun in it so far . I bought him extra pirate play accessories for some added fun . It 's adorable watching him salute and yelling & # 34 ; Aye aye captain ! & # 34 ;	1
This is n't the sturdiest tent ever , but my son was delighted to find it under the tree from & # 34 ; Santa & # 34 ; when we were staying at Grandma 's house out of state . It was easy and light to transport back home in our suitcase . He ripped The basketball net off accidentally the first day , but I can sew it back . He loves pretending to be Jake sailing around in Bucky and we use a tunnel to connect it to another Playhut tent he has had for over two years ( and has held up very well to toddler abuse ) .	1
My 4 year old got this for Christmas . IT is very cute . Maybe not the best quality but it is cute and my 4 year old loves it so I am happy with the purchase .	1
Love this pirate tent . We 've had it 6+ months now , and each of my 3 kids ( 2 , 4 , 6 ) play with it . It has held up very well and they LOVE it . All a mom could ask for !	1
My grandson loved this . He would drag it all over the place . Well made and durable . Fast shipping ! Would recommend this to anyone with a small boy who loves pirates .	1
My kids love to play in this . my daughter was a pirate for halloween so the only problem is that she wants to change into her halloween costume every time so plays in there ... lol	1
My 3 year old loves this . It folds down flat to a 18 & # 34 ; circle with a string to tie it shut . All you do to assemble is untie the string and it pops right up then a couple of Velcro fasteners and you are ready to play . I do not recommend sharp objects around this because with the type of material one small hole will grow quickly . Great for 1-5 year olds .	1
My son was so excited about & # 34 ; BUCKY & # 34 ; ! When he and my nephew horse play in it , it 's easy for them to set back up . Its the right size for 2 BIG three year olds .	1
I got this for decoration/play area for my son 's bday party . It was a hit with all the kids , easy to set up and take home and reset up . My son has it in his room now and loves playing with it . Absolutely the best thing I bought for my son 's bday party .	1
This was bought in addition to the rc racer and woody . My son loved it ! it says a few phrases-To infinity and beyond , activate hyper drive , the gamma quadrant is dead a head . There is alittle switch in the back if the ship that has a picture of woody on one side and a picture of the aliens and each one makes additional noises . The ship lights up and makes rocket noises each time you push the button down . It 's not education but is nice entertainment for pretend play . This is a little over priced , I paid half this at TRU	1
Bought this for my son who was about 18 months for Christmas . He loves Little People stuff and this toy was perfect as he loves Toy Story . We bought the Toy Story RC and Woody too which his favorite but he likes this as well . We had the Little People plane which is similar to this so I was hesitatnt to buy this but he loves it as he loves Toy Story and loves playing with the Buzz character .	1
My son received this as a Christmas gift and I love it . It is adorable and has a small Buzz Lightyear Little People character along with the spaceship . There are a few Buzz phrases that it says and the taillights light up . The doors open as well and there is a switch with Woody on one side and the aliens on the other . Super cute for a Toy Story fan !	1
My 4 year old son has a Buzz Lightyear action figure and my 2 year old seemed to be a fan of him as well , so this was a great chance to get him a toy that he could recognize and enjoy for himself ! The ship is a real nice size and all the little people figures are compatible with it ! The sounds are genuine and the wings extend out to make a fun toy for younger kids !	1
My 2 yr old nephew was given this as a present for the holidays . He loves buzz lightyear . The older kids loved it too because it was from Toy Story .	1
I purchased these for my granddaughter for Christmas . She loved them . I 'm sure she will have hours of bath time fun with these . They are so adorable .	1
My 2 year old loves the Bubble Guppies but the toys for this series are n't too abundant so when I found these I was thrilled . I bought another set too and my son loves these . They are larger than I though they would be and are very cute . We play with these every night in the tub .	1
Good toys for the bathtub if your child likes Bubble Guppies . Decent size & material . I would recommend these toys .	1
This is the perfect size for little hands to carry around , not just in the tub . Love all things Bubble Guppies at our house !	1
We purchased these to add to the first collection of bubble guppies . They were well worth the addition . We recommend the entire group .	1
The whole bubble guppies series is a little expensive but the quality is good , the colors are great and the characters are just the right size . These are great bath toys and hold up very well with lots of use .	1
Bubble Guppies are good toys for the bath or pool . The little kids really seem to like them . Good for boys or girls .	1
My daughter is a Bubble Guppie fanatic , it 's almost scary . When I was looking for Bubble Guppie toys I did n't find many . I bought these thinking they would stay in the tub , they do not . She plays with them all the time , in the tub out of the tub . They are very durable and look exactly like the characters . I only wish they had Gobi and Deema .	1
The characters were adorable . My 2 and 3 yr old loved them and play with them in the bath at night . They were a little pricey , but they are bright and are good quality . I would recommend them to a friend	1
I bought these for my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter for the bathtub and she loves them ! Wonderful product to have !	1
Nice bath toys if your children like Bubble Guppies like mine do . Loved at bath time , they squirt , float and make bath time fun .	1
The toy arrived promptly in a nice package . The detail on each squirter was very much like how they look on TV except the starfish which does n't have the eyes colored in . The whole starfish is the same color of peach . They are pretty big for bath squirters- about the size of my 2-year olds hands so she has a good grip on them . Overall , still a great toy . My daughter loves them and carries them around everywhere . I do notice that the price of the toys shift from day to day . I caught it at $ 11.99 with prime shipping but the next day it shot up to $ 22.99 . I 've seen if for $ 9.99 on other sites but they do n't ship . Not worth more than 12 bucks for 3 squirters .	1
My 2 year old daughter loves Bubble Guppies and so do I - the characters are cute and spunky , the songs are fun to sing to , and the show is very educational . I still hear my 4 year old singing the bones song `` underneath the skin we 're in ! `` My daughter loves Molly so I got this set for her and the Gil set for my son ( Fisher-Price Nickelodeon Bubble Guppies Gil , Mr. Grouper , Lobster Bath Squirters ) . She instantly wanted to take a bath and we could n't get her and Molly and Oona in there fast enough . Since then , Molly and Oona go everywhere with her - she demands they sit on her high chair table with her and that she has them in bed . She gets upset if she does n't have them , and she 's had them for at least a month now . Note that we gave her the starfish too but it 's like she does n't even know it ever existed ... it 's still in a frying pan on her play cookset shelf.Molly and Oona 's likenesses are extremely good and they are medium soft rubber/plastic material . Both kids have a bit of a challenge filling them to squirt them , but then again , they have a challenge with all the squirters I 've ever gotten . After all this time clutched in her little hands and traveling all over ( she snuck them into the car to go to day care even ) , they do n't show any wear ( Molly 's pink hair does not have rub-spots ) .Very happy that we finally have toys to play with from the show we all love .	1
I was completely satisfied with these toys . They were a little larger than I had thought they would be , which is a good thing . They are not to big to be played with easily in the tub . So cute and adorable . Very well made .	1
My granddaughter loves everything Bubble Guppies ! She was in heaven when I gave her this . She does n't play with them in the tub , she wants to carry it with her all the time .	1
We purchased this for our 2 year granddaughter who lives with us . She plays with them every night in her bath . She loves them .	1
Bubble guppies are so cute , my grandson , enjoys watching the show , and now he has his own set to play with in the tub	1
I bought this for my grandsons and they love it . The size of the characters is a little larger than I expected so I was pleasantly surprised . The plastic is very soft and pliable and the colors are brilliant . Very good product .	1
My son loves the bubble guppies . I was disappointed with the first few toys that came out for the show . But when I saw they had bath squirters I thought it was just perfect . He loves it . They are quite big , so do n't be surprised . I would say it could be used as a small doll . I only wish they sold the boy characters together in a pack like they do the girls . Its kindof a ripoff that you have to buy two different packs to get the boys available when you only need to get one to get both girls .	1
I have a water loving grandson who loves Bubble Guppies . Now he can enjoy his baths and hand washings with his buddies .	1
My 4 year old went off Bubble Guppies for a while , but when his little sister fell in love with the show , he got pulled right back in . Since they love taking baths together , I got them each one of the squirter sets so they could play together.My son likes filling them up with water and squirting me , though it 's only play as he closes the glass shower door before squirting and I do n't actually get wet . = ) They are medium-hard ( I was surprised they were as hard as they are , my 2 year old has problems squirting , but is that a bad thing ? ) and super cute . Mr. Grouper got hijacked by my toddler , so my son just plays with Gil and the lobster.Lots of fun for the bathtub .	1
My boys LOVE Chuck and Friends , so this was a big hit . Durable , easy to crank and comes with the Chuck truck ( plus a couple things of playdoh ) .	1
I love this Playdoh set ... and my son does , too . Unlike other sets we have owned , the playdoh never gets stuck in the grinder , which is one of my biggest frustrations with these toys . My son loves to load up the back of the little truck with bricks or gravel and then dump out the entire load on the playmat . Lots of fun for a pretty low price ! Pros : *The playdoh does not get stuck in the grinder - so that makes cleanup easy ! *It 's great for imaginative play and it does n't take up a lot of space . *The grinder has small molds on the side , allowing you to make bricks and tires . *InexpensiveCons : *At 2 1/2 , my son ca n't work the grinder on his own . I have to do it with him .	1
My 4 yr. old son loves this toy . The play mat is about 18 in . by 13 in . and the rock maker is about 10 in . tall . It came with the mat , the rock maker , `` chuck '' the dump truck and two small cans of play doh . Yes , the overall set is kinda small but my son seems to love everything about it . He grinds up the play doh to make rocks for hours ! Im very pleased with this set and would recommend it !	1
My 3-year old received this as birthday gift . It is great fun for both the play-doh and construction enthusist child . He is both . The buyer must be warned , however , that this is one of those toys where the adult will need to help with the gravel grinder . A child left to operate it alone will find themselves quickly frustrated . As a mom with four children , all born within 5.5 years of one another , I must advocate that the only playdoh set one will ever need with children is theMelissa & Doug Shape , Model and Mold . Though the play dough that comes with this set is nothing to write home about , the tools offer a simplicty and room to be creative that all my children have found to be enjoyable . We 've had about all the sets one can imagine , and at the end of the day , simple is best , as it encourages imagination . Overall , I give the construction set a 4 star rating because your little guy or gal will surely be fasicinated by the gravel , and if you are playing along with them , that will make it all the more great !	1
I bought this with the crane playdoh set and I noticed it had a mat to go with it . However , the mat is paper pretty much and it has lasted about 4 uses and now is starting to tear . The playdoh seems to dry up way faster than his other playdoh , so I do n't know it is just this one set or not . The roller thing is great , only you have to put a little in at a time and it gets stuck up under the rollers and i have to help my son dig it our . Overall , great concept and I would buy this again .	1
I love that this toy brings playdoh , Tonka and a playmat all together . There is a lot of play potential with this set . Plus , playdoh is easy to add to and replace . My nephew is going to love getting this . It 's right up his alley . Quick shipping and nice packaging .	1
My three year old opened it and was really excited . He could figure out the concept right away and had a lot of fun . He can do it by himself . Great toy .	1
What do you get when you combine Tonka Trucks with Play Doh ? You get the Play Doh Diggin Rigs Tonka Chuck and Friends Playsets . That is more than a mouthful , but it does describe this combination of the construction feel of Tonka Trucks with imaginative play of Play Doh.The Play Doh Diggin RIgs Tonka Chuck Brick Mill is a nice starter set for your child 's Ply Doh construction set . In addition to the Brick Mill you get a small front-end loader and a play mat . The brick mill rolls out a continuous tape of bricks that can be press cut at the bottom . In practice it does n't quite work as well as you would hope . The bricks are produced by turning a small crank and turning two small wheels that press out the bricks . Small children may have trouble in both turning the crank and turning the crank in the correct direction . The other challenge is that the bricks have a tendency to roll-up the rolls instead of coming out straight . Not a big deal , but it require some adult observation.Notes -- In addition to the Brick Mill a small front-end loader is also included . The front-end loader both rolls and has the ability to lift its scoop ! - The sides of the Brick Mill include a series of molds so that you can make a variety of brick shapes.- Minimal accessories which , for me , is great because it means fewer things that will be lost ! - Even though it is brick mill it really is easy to clean- The mat is a glorified advertisement - one side is an advertisement while the other side is a nice road scene for moving and transporting the bricks.Final Verdict - The Play Doh Diggin RIgs Tonka Chuck Brick Mill is a nice starting block for any Play Doh Diggin Rigs construction set . Boys ( and maybe girls too ) will love making bricks and creating their own construction scene.4 1/2 Stars	1
Cute set , makes cool little roads .	1
As our grandson grows older , he enjoys combining construction toys with Play-Doh , instead of just squeezing shapes out of the extruders .	1
My 3-year old received this item for his birthday along withPlay-Doh Diggin ' Rigs Tonka Chuck 'N Friends Grinding Gravel Yard Set . I have written a review for that item as well . As stated with that review , this item is great fun and the construction and play-doh enthusiast will be thrilled ! However , the mechanism making bricks and roads will require some adult supervision , lest the child playing with it becomes frustrated quickly . Of course , the tike can be taught , but you are fooling yourself if you think you can just leave the child alone for some independent play with this one.If you really want to buy one play dough set , and never have to buy another , considerMelissa & Doug Shape , Model and Mold . Although the dough with that set is nothing to write home about , the simplicity of that particular set offers a child lots of imaginary play and is perfect for working on fine motor skills . We have four children , all born with 5.5 years , and after trying out every play-doh set in the book , this is still my favorite.All in all , I give the construction sets a 4 star rating , because your child will undoubtedly be fasicnated by the mechanism as well as the unique play-doh that comes with the set ( rust red for bricks , `` shiny '' silver for the roads ) .	1
My 2 and 4 year olds love playing with the pretend & # 34 ; road & # 34 ; created by this set . They enjoy making a & # 34 ; road & # 34 ; out of the pieces as well as stacking them . This set gets more playtime than the one with the & # 34 ; dirt & # 34 ; and dump truck . The crank is too hard for my 2 year old to turn , but my 4 year old can handle it with no problems .	1
I liked Dashi but for some reason I thought Torpedo Ray had some kind of feature . It did n't matter to my grandson , it completed his set .	1
This is an addition to my granddaughters Octonauts playset collection . Sturdy , nicely made toy which arrived very quickly . Also like the fact that these can also be played with in the bathtub .	1
Bought this when the price dropped below $ 20 . Very hard to find this set in stores . Glad amazon sells it . Dashi and ray are very cute and look long lasting . Son loves playing with them in the bathtub .	1
Octonauts are delightful toys . The children 's television show , & # 34 ; The Octonauts & # 34 ; , is educational as well as fun . My grandson loves the Octonauts . Sometimes the character figures are hard to find . So pleased to see these available on Amazon .	1
Octonaut toys are now launched in the US and are available at MUCH lower prices . We love these toys and are happy to be able to afford the entire set now ! I bought this toy for 4.99	1
ca n't find this in american stores so it is great that amazon carries it . not a fan of the crazy mark up of it but you got ta do what you got ta do to please your 3 year old on his bday .	1
I bought this toy ( Dashi ) to complete my grandson 's collection . He plays with them in the bath tub , car and he even sleeps with them !	1
our son who is 5 1/2 loves watching octonauts and loves all his characters - its cute and a fun toy for even a 3 year old ... .it just takes forever to get it . it took about 2 weeks to get ours ! we have the octopod and gups so its fun to have the complete set !	1
Very cute addition to the Octopod playset we ordered . The dots on the cuttlefish change color in water ( and even in your hand if you hold it long enough ) .	1
My granddaughter is a big Octonauts fan so I purchased this to add to her collection . She plays with this almost every day . Well made and is a double duty toy as it can also be used in the bathtub .	1
My son loves all things octonauts , but this set is especially great bc of the cuttlefish . It is so hard to find one !	1
My son ca n't get enough of the Octonauts ! If it was n't for the price , i would buy him every piece , they bring him that much joy .	1
Our granddaughter squealed when she opened this package . She loves playing with it with the Octonauts home . This is a good buy .	1
durable fun little characters and creatures from the octonauts . i do n't normally like branded toys but these are so cute and fun .	1
My three year old has a huge collection of Thomas trains and toys , we just needed Sir Topem Hat . It is such a cute little toy that my baby loves .	1
My grandson loves to play out the story of Blue Mountain Mystery Movie and this toy was featured in that movie . Hours of fun .	1
Winston is Sir Topham Hatt 's track inspection vehicle , and first appeared in 2012 's Blue Mountain Mystery DVD ! Winston may not be the `` brightest bulb '' in the pack , but he 's smart enough not to let on about what a terrible driver Sir Topham Hatt is ! Though he gets distracted easily , he 's a well meaning and fun little vehicle , and the scenes in the movie with Winston had our grandson in stitches ! He 's red with gold nameplates and gold horns on his sides , with a little Sir Topham Hatt sitting inside We found him at ToysRUs for $ 5.99 . ( Update : Fisher-Price 's summer 2013 MSRP for their small engines/vehicles is $ 6 . ) Update : The 23 non-train characters in the Take-n-Play line as of summer 2013 are great favorites of my grandson , and are just darling ! Whether it 's Annie & Clarabel ( Thomas ' coaches ) , members of `` The Pack '' - Alfie ( excavator ) , Kelly ( crane truck ) , Byron ( bulldozer ) , Isobella ( vintage flatbed lorry ) , Jack ( front loader ) - the Sodor Search & Rescue Center ( SSRC ) Team - Harold ( helicopter ) , Rocky ( crane ) , Captain ( lifeboat ) , Flynn ( fire engine ) , Butch ( breakdown truck ) - or the many others - Kevin ( crane ) , Bertie ( bus ) , Sir Topham Hatt 's ( blue ) car , Elizabeth ( vintage steam lorry ) , Madge ( large flatbed truck ) , Mr. Percival 's ( red ) car , Winston ( Sir Topham Hatt 's track inspection vehicle ) , Hector ( coal hopper ) - we love them all ! There 's also Cranky ( docks tower crane ) , Colin ( canal side crane ) , and Owen ( traction engine ) , who are all featured in playsets.We were first time grandparents of a 2 1/2 year old when my husband and I began a TnP collection for our grandson , hoping he 'd pass it along to his own kids one day . We 've ALL had such a great time interacting with this overall quality line of trains , vehicles and playsets ! He turned 4 at the end of April , and still enjoys spending a couple of hours of each day he spends with us in the Sodor land of make believe that spans a large portion of our basement . Although Disney 's `` Cars '' characters are beginning to occupy a different portion , it 's nice to see our investment continuing to hold his interest , engaging and encouraging that active imagination ! Grandson # 2 came along in March , so we plan to continue collecting TnP for several years to come .	1
I bought this for my 4 year old son for his birthday . All Thomas products are very popular with this age group . They can never get enough of Thomas trains and tracks . The die-cast metal makes the piece durable and able to withstand constant roughing from a little boy .	1
my son liked that sir topham hat was inside . we do n't have any of the take-along tracks . instead , i drew tracks onto a piece of paper and laminated it ; we use it as a placemat at restaurants/other people 's homes and he gets to play with his thomas toys on the go . we also will let him carry one around if we are out and about since they cost so much less than the wooden trains that we keep at home .	1
I ordered this for my grandson for his birthday . He was very happy ! I think he has just about every Thomas the Tank car they offer . Great purchase at a great price .	1
this take and play series gives such fun and is played with every day Thomas and his friends are a firm favourite	1
I love the Take-n-Play trains and cars , they are sturdy and go well with the Take-n-Play sets and roll smoothly on the tracks . This one does not have the front and back magnets that other trains have , so it ca n't be linked up with a train , but this is supposed to be the track inspection car , so it probably should n't be linked with the trains . My 3 year old loves having Sir Topham hat in one of his vehicles !	1
Oh my goodness , when my grandson saw this he flipped out ! He just about has all the Thomas trains now and he always wants more !	1
Hard to find Thomas the train toy . I was very happy to find Winston online because my 5 year old son loves the unique take-n-Play toys . He is autistic & always has to have a train in I his hands to keep him calm . He has so many trains that he was getting tired of looking at the same ones over & over . I began to order him the most unique toys I could find so he would have a huge variety of characters - not just the trains . This was a great addition to his set of different shaped Thomas the train friends .	1
Was pleased with how quickly this came . My grandson loves it . I would recommend this toy to any kid that loves the power rangers .	1
My boys love these and it was great when they realized that the spin sword fits into just like on Power Rangers . Ad this to the costumes from Halloween , and they have hours of imaginative fun .	1
My son loves this & # 34 ; fire smasher & # 34 ; - he calls it . I do n't like it becuase I feel each disc should make a different sound - they all make the same noise . But my son does n't notice and really likes it . A friend brought over a sword and the two seem compatible ( they fit together ) . Did n't know that so that was a fun surprise if you 're in the market for two toys . Decent quality and I do n't think I paid that much for it . So good buy , I suppose .	1
We got this from Toys R Us . My son loves it and with all of the abuse this thing takes I ca n't beleive it still works . He constantly is hitting something with it ( it combines with another Power Rangers toy too ) . It also has an off switch when you get tired of the sounds . Kid tested , Dad approved .	1
As I said in the item above , this piece also made it possible for him to use his imagination and have a great time playing .	1
You place the spin sword into the bullzooka and it can spin . The Bullzooka makes noises of the power ranger series from TV . My 5 year old grandson received the mask , sword , and this for his birthday and it was the biggest hit ! Since he 's a power ranger fan and knows the name of all the power rangers , he loves it ! He puts his mask on , places the sword into the bullzooka and voila ! He becomes a power ranger and fights imaginary foes ! ! !	1
The product was exactly what I expected it to be . I love it and it goes great with other samurai products . It also came three days early !	1
This large truck talks and tumbles and keeps my grandson completely enthralled . He 's almost two and right now it seems best to have an adult watching and supervising . He wants to ride on it , which is n't the purpose ! He loves the interaction , particularly the singing . This toy is going to get more play as he gets older . It 's very sturdy so will be around for a long time , hopefully ! I had to add the results of my grandson 's Thanksgiving visit . He LOVED the truck and played with it more than any other toy . The family got a kick out of it , too !	1
This truck is fun for my little guys to play with . It is a little loud of me , but my boys love it . I was surprised that it tumbled as easily as it does and over all am happy with this purchase .	1
I picked this product for my one year old grandson as he loves trucks . We took it out of the box and started it into the gyrations that it can do . Great fun ! My grandson was entranced . His eyes never left the truck and he was laughing and could n't wait to take it out for a spin . The truck engages the child with banter and interactive requests for which it coordinates sounds and gymnastics . I really like this product and rate it very high . I rated it a four star because , the toy has a more limited set of `` events '' than a $ 50 item should have in my opinion . What it does , it does very well.However , this is my CAUTION : Do not let a younger child handle this toy by themselves . My grandson loves to drive his trucks around the house . When you push this truck from behind , there is no stability - and this is necessary for the truck to do its flips and such . But for the little one pushing , the truck flips into their face and `` bang '' a cut lip . We put the truck away for another 6 months to see how he can do with it later . This is not the fault of the vehicle or the manufacturer . It was our fault for not realizing why the age limit was set.I think that with a couple of more months of walking under his belt , he will be able to play with this truck again . Until the little accident , we thought that we had a tremendous winner for our youngster . I still think that we have a winner , but we will have to wait just a little longer for those smiles .	1
My three year old daughter is really into toy cars and trucks , and she likes this one a lot and it really makes her laugh and shout when she plays with it.First off the truck is large by kid standards , and the colors are bright and fun . The wheels , smokestack and grill are all oversized and chunky . Its fun to lean on an push around , and works on carpet and hard floors . I only wish the back hatch dumped out all the way . We fill it with blocks but it only lifts an inch , not enough slant to tip anything out.The voice sound effects , including talking and laughing are fun and engaging , and the volume is not shrill or harsh . Perhaps it can be a bit repetitive at times if your child likes to press on the horn over and over like my child does . Even if you want to go without batteries , its a perfectly fun toy to play with . The tricks like the flip are really suprising and fun , and it manages to do it really well without ever flipping over !	1
My kids loved this toy truck the moment it came in the door . It comes ready to go , so there 's nothing to do . The appearance of this truck captivated them and the sound effects captured them.This truck makes noises like a real truck such as engine the idle sound . It uses a boy 's voice that says many different types of things which along with the sound effects make the toy difficult to resist . Additionally , the truck makes some motions that are attention-getting.I was surprised at how much time my kids spend with this truck . The big reward comes when the truck rolls , which does n't happen constantly . This is an example of a toy designed for maximum temptation to pick up , touch and roll .	1
My grandson has the previous Chuck that talks , rolls on his own and `` plays games '' . This one looks the same , which I was hoping would n't be the case . I was disappointed that it did n't `` drive '' on it 's own . But , it 's very entertaining to watch him flip and move his air horns and dump basket . My grandson likes to push his trucks around and does n't seem to mind that it does n't do it on it 's own . It 's still a cute toy and I recommend it for birthday/Christmas , etc . presents .	1
We have several chuck trucks , this is definitely an improved version of the interactive chucks . He does flip over by himself , which is really fun . My son is definitely in awe of it . I am really worried about battery drainage on it , because it takes a while for it to go into sleep mode after you are done playing . So far , it has been a winner !	1
PROS : -Well built ( for a plastic toy anyway ) -Compact size-Large wheels which are easy to roll around-Tumbling feature is pretty cool . ( Only works on hard surfaces though . ) CONS : -Can be a bit annoying for parents . The truck does a lot of irritating `` talking '' in attempts to engage your child and will go on for a while even after your child leaves the toy.-Does n't tumble properly on carpet . Works fine on a hard surface though.-The truck bed is too small and shallow to actually hold anything . So do n't buy this with the intention that your child will pretend to haul things around.NOTES : -It is somewhat non-intuitive how to play with this toy . The buttons are just part of the truck ( exhaust , bed , lights , underbody ) so a young child wo n't even realize to use them.-There is no button that will directly cause the truck to tumble . You have to follow the truck 's commands and push buttons at the appropriate time.OVERALL : A well-built toy which is best suited for a child who likes to spend a lot of time with a toy figuring things out and has the attention span and intellect to follow commands and experiment with the buttons .	1
This toy is awesome . My 2 year old loves playing with Chuck and would take him to bed with him at night if I let him , he drags chuck everywhere ! Chuck is really interactive , maybe the most interactive toy that we own . He is always saying new things and entertaining my son . He finds chuck really funny and laughs at him all the time . Chuck asks him to do things like load him up which sends my son running to find toys to load up . This toy is all about fun and will keep any kid busy for a long time . This toy as a gift will be the favorite , especially for a little boy that loves trucks . HIGHLY recommend .	1
Picked this guy up for my 3 year old nephew who loves everything cars and trucks right now . He just loves the way Chuck moves , talks , tumbles and he can fill his truck up , too . He 's pretty cool , actually . He says a ton of phrases and sings ! Lucas likes to sing along with him and I find it impressive that he sings faster the faster he moves , neat trick ! Lucas loves that he somersaults and flips all around , so of course , being a boy , keeps trying to find ways to put Chuck into predicaments he CA N'T get out of , but he has yet to trick him ! It 's fun to watch him play with his new truck and go back and forth with it , it keeps him pretty busy for awhile , and not many toys do that with a 3 year old ! Highly recommended !	1
So first off this truck frustrated me while still in the box . It says `` Try Me '' and it points at what appears are the exhaust pipes up top . They wiggle but nothing happens . As I 'm fighting the packaging to get it open I notice it says press my lights . So while it was still attached to the box , but not yet free from it 's cardboard prison I started jabbing the truck in the mouth ... and then the eyes ... more or less where I expected lights to be . They are separate panels which move a little bit , but still nothing , so I assumed the starter batteries were dead . So after freeing it I played the super dad fix it card by getting four C batteries and a screwdriver to replace the starter batteries . Only to find the same presses did nothing . Walking away in defeat I hear the sound of motors and Chuck 's voice behind me . It turns out that my 3 year old knew how to turn it on and the starter batteries later tested fine . You have to press the `` lights '' which I though were the horns ( and were obscured from view inside the box ) on the top of Chuck 's head to activate him . So that was frustrating ... but after that both my son ( 3 ) and daughter ( 5 ) who are big fans of the show enjoyed watching him contort and hum and talk.The motion and sound to me is a lot like the Tickle Me Elmo style of toy where there are quick but low torque movements which are safe for little hands while still appearing exciting . I do n't see what they 'll learn from it , but for an interactive plaything it not bad . A tickle pad under his `` chin '' and some antics , but nothing amazing and nothing disappointing either . A good solid birthday pick for a truck and/or Chuck fan aged 2-5.PROS : + Interactive `` doll '' ... made into a truck.+ Lots of sayings , does n't get repetitive.+ Delights fans of the show ( he hums and sings parts of the theme song ) .CONS : - Frustrating packaging- Non-obvious activation button- No real educational value ( maybe exercise , but it 's a stretch considering it 's not really human like )	1
This is for my 22month old going on 8 yrs old lol..He loves cars and trucks and drives his ( anything with wheels ) toys all over the house , and people at the house . He loves how it rolls , talks , tumbles , and loves filling up the rear with other toys ! Its pretty darn sturdy as i ve seen it fly off the couch , dinner table , down the steps inside and outside on concrete . Chuck has also been stomped on and rammed into the walls and dogs and cat . Needless to say - if we need a `` baby sitter '' chuck helps us out !	1
If you are looking for a durable , fun toy for a pre-schooler , Tumblin ' Chuck may be it . Definitely well made , bright colors , cool music , and kids love , love Chuck ! It plays music , and the music speeds up depending on how fast Chuck is moving . He stops , rolls over , and is sturdy enough to hold up through a lot of rough play . I tried this out with my 3 1/2 year old grandson , and he was occupied , intently , with this truck for hours.The only downside is the huge amount of packaging and the time it takes to get Tumblin ' Chuck loose from the box . Even I got impatient ! The truck has space for hauling blocks , legos , whatever . The tunes are catchy . And I think it encourages imagination as well as being entertaining . Too big for a car toy , but great to tuck in the back to take on a trip to Grandma 's house !	1
I 've got a 2.5yr old and 4 yr old and they both love this toy . It 's a completely different toy to both of them in how they interact so I think it 's got some longevity and they have n't tired of it in a week so it holds their attention as well.The myriad of different activities is really impressive and really one of the few drawbacks to the toy because sometimes they just want it to tumble and it wants to talk and do exercises ! It works best on a hard surface , plush carpets are n't it 's best play area and it 's really a rough and tumble toy so it can take abuse , as well as smart a bit if it bumps heads during a group tumble.My kids just ca n't get enough of Chuck so he 's a keeper !	1
This Chuck the Tumblin ' Truck has been one of my 3-year old son 's favorite toys since he received it almost nine months ago . It is your basic toy truck in that he can push it along the floor , and it	1
This guy talks , tumbles , sings , rumbles with a fun lovin ' attitude ready to play with toddler/pre-schooler.He stands shy of a foot , plastic , colorful ; press his lights to get him talking . He speaks with a friendly boy 's voice with over 80 phrases and sound- so they say.He rolls foward , and you can roll him back ; load him up , dump him out- the whole time he talks . His eyes and happy smile move a little when he interacts.The plastic appears durable labelled with a few decals . So far , the sand in the sandbox has n't messed his innards up ; works best on a hard floor ; runs on 4 C batteries- included.Age stated 3+ , but any youngster should find him a blast . Nice Christmas or birthday gift . Dad approved- really nothing to assemble . Time for Chuck and I to hit the road !	1
The Chuck Tumblin ' Chuck is great fun for small children . This is the Somersaulting Dump Truck . There are also over 80 Phrases . This is more than just a truck you push around . This truck will do all kinds of tricks . This toy is sure to amuse . My grandson laughs andjust has a good time when playing with Chuck Tumblin ' Chuck .	1
No pieces to lose on it and it talks and rolls over great.My grandson actually plays with this toy .	1
Your kid will love it , and you may grow tired of conversing with it . BUT that 's true of all noise-making toys . Chuck is a magically responsive toy . Just nudging the toy as you walk through your house will cause Chuck to start talking to ( that 's why you may hate it ) . My son LOVED this toy . We both enjoyed figuring out all the things that Chuck could do . There were so many options - `` working out '' , rolling , tickling , racing , making music ... Chuck responded to what you did to it and suggested what you could do next . This is the way of toys of the future.On the other hand , of course , there 's more creativity in having a plain wooden truck and making your own stories and adventures with it . But I do think there 's some creative value to Chuck , especially in the first few plays as you figure out what to do with it . There is an aspect of discovery ( especially if you throw out the manual ! ) . They say kids learn from discovering things more than they do from being shown them.Now , Chuck has not become a favorite toy . He got a lot of attention the first few days , but now he 's second-best again to Legos . However , when we have other kids to the house for playdates , we always break out Chuck because he 's a hit.Basically , it 's a fun toy BUT it does n't have longevity unless you really have a truck kid on your hands that will be using it as a truck as well as a talking toy . So , that can be important to parents with a limited toy budget , to buy the toy with the most bang for the buck . In our family , building toys like legos and blocks have more longevity and re-use . On the other hand , if your son or daughter really enjoys a truck , then this would be a truck PLUS . Because not only does it have a workable dump truck function and you can wheel it around , it also does all sorts of other cute things .	1
This was what my Grandson asked for at Christmas ... .I believe he saw it on TV , but it really is a cool little truck ! It talks and makes truck noises and moves ! He was over the top happy when he unwrapped it and did n't want to open anything else after that and would n't quit asking till it was taken out of it 's packaging so he could play with it ! ! His sister liked it too as did his male and female cousins so it was a hit even with the older kids and the one it was bought for is 3 ! ! So I 'd recommend it for the littler kids boy or girl !	1
Tumblin ' Chuck is a generously sized toy , nearly a foot long and nine inches high . We chose this toy for our two-year-old grandson who is mesmerized by Chuck 's motions , sounds , and speech . This is a toy that a young boy ( or girl ) can interact with and be amused by . I 'm impressed by how rugged this toy is , a toy that can be dropped multiple times and still go on its merry way . Reminds me of the old Timex commercials shown decades ago.Gabe especially likes watching Chuck do flips or roll across the floor . He also likes watching it dump a load of blocks onto the floor so he can refill Chuck 's bed with the same blocks . I wish the truck also had flashing lights , for more sensory stimulation but maybe that 's expecting too much.I plan to buy a Tumbling Chuck book hoping Gabe will associate the same joyful feelings with books and reading .	1
Santa got this for my little boy for Christmas , and he just loved it . I like how Chuck does sit ups and all-in-all this is a pretty cool truck . I think any little boy would like this truck .	1
There are many ways to be a good grandma . You can bake cookies , take walks , read stories or give your 2 1/2 year old grandson a Chuck Tumblin ' Chuck . That 's right . I bribed my way into my grandson 's affection . He LOVES this truck . He 's been into dumptrucks for a time now . His second birthday featured dumptrucks on his cake so I thought this would be a winner and I was right.This truck does everything . It spins , does back flips and moves along with the voice . It matches it 's speed to the child . He gets so much pleasure out of it . I love to hear him laughing and devising new obstacles for the truck . He thinks it 's a little magical . It does so many amazing things.It 's extremely durable . It 's run into walls , cabinets , trees and a dog and keeps on chugging . He hauls dirt in it and other cars . He moves things from spot to spot . It really engages his imagination and his sense of fun.This is the best toy I 've ever gotten for him . It 's so user friendly , well built , engaging and just plain fun .	1
This a great toy for young child . Being a dump-truck it is geared for a boy but for the age it is geared even a girl would enjoy it . Very interactive and it has a lot of places that triggers sounds and noises . The truck also rolls over adding to the overall enjoyment of the toy.Skip the video-games for your 3 yr old and get them this toy !	1
This is a truck my son just likes so much . As with all of his other trucks , it is one of his favorites . So much that he brought it in the bathtub with him , as he does with his other non-electronic toys . Not recommended . Now it 's just a truck , that does nothing.However , when it did work , it was pretty cool and very animated . We , mom and myself , would catch each other repeating or mimicking some of the phrases . It 's just that addicting.Overall , it was good fun while it lasted . Santa may be good for a replacement this year . Who knows ? We 'll see !	1
We gave this toy to our 5 year old after he had to get stitches on his forehead . He loves it , but had a bit of a hard time figuring out all of the transformers actions at first . It 's not as big as I thought it was going to be , but it is still a lot of fun for him , and he tries to keep it from his other siblings ( a seal of approval right there ) .	1
My boys , ages 7 and 5 , love Transformers and especially Optimus Prime so there really is n't much of a way that this toy would n't be a big hit with them . They got so excited when they saw it , especially my youngest.The set comes with a mobile headquarters which is a large firetruck-like truck that unfolds to become a playset . It includes the Optimus Prime vehicle and action figure Cody Burns . The Optimus Prime can fit inside the large truck and can roll out to come to the rescue with Cody Burns riding inside ! Cody is a character from the Rescue Bots cartoon so if you 're a fan from the movies , you may be thinking who the heck is Cody Burns.It 's a cool set that has lights and sounds . The Optimus Prime does n't do much transforming which I think is perfect for smaller children ; they have trouble with the transforming ones . Shoot , I have trouble getting some of those to transform myself . This one is advertised as being for ages 3 - 7 and I totally agree with that . Children over that age will probably one a more complex transformer but this set is perfect for my two boys which fit into that age range .	1
This Toy works well on it 's own or as part of your Rescue Bots collections of toys such as the ones we have , theTransformers Rescue Bots - Blades The Copter-Bot , Bots and Robbers Police HeadquartersandPlayskool Heroes Transformers Rescue Bots Energize Bumblebee Figure . I should point out that we got some of the others to go with this toy and we have n't been sorry . I just missed reviewing this until now Please forgive my lateness . However , this toy & its companion sets are STILL favorites in our house so they have staying power ! . This first experience with the Rescue Bots convinced us to get more from the series . Your child CAN play with is on it 's own as a stand alone toy . In fact , our guy would have been happy to just keep playing with the set as is since the larger truck opens up and and has a cool place to slide the little blonde action figure into the Optimus Prime figure in his `` Truck Formation '' so he and Optimus can drive the Rescue Vehicle together . If you add a few other sets to your inventory , there are other command stations for more figures to man when the truck is opened up as an Emergency Center.We 've had this for many months now and the only things that are showing any wear and tear are the stickers and that 's simply due to the fact that they have been peeled off and re-applies a few times - such are the whims of children ! Other than that all we 've had to replace arworn out batteries . The set comes with 2 Double A ( AA ) Alkaline batteries and it was only recently that we had to replace them . Make sure you always replaces with Alkaline batteries and not batteries labeled `` Heavy Duty '' because those are the type that corrode . Stay with the Alkaline to be safe.As with the other sets , The majority of play seems to be with just the Optimus Prime Truck/Figure and the little man action figure . Those are the real draw for Transfomer fan kids ( as well as adults ! ) But now that we have the other sets , when other kids his age are over for a visit , they drag them all out and have a real heavy duty play session with the larger trucks and the Police Headquarters set as well as Bumblebee . Our child played with this set only for weeks and did n't tire of it so I would say that the add-ons are purely your choice . We added them on because the prices were very reasonable and our guy was anxious to have more pieces in the series to interact with the one he had.I agree with other reviewers who suggest that age of 3 is a little young for this toy and that the upper limit of 7 might be pushing it unles your kid is way into Transformers and imaginative play . When you start pushing uppwards of 7 and 8 , there are whole new sectors of Transformer toys available including Lego sets and more complex ( and expensive ) figures . Start with this basic set since it has Optimus Prime and see what your child 's reaction to it is . If he 's zooming around the house having a total blast and aching for more `` little guys '' to man those science stations , well , this is an easy set of toys to acquire piece by piece and judge their interest as you go . The prices are reasonable and the products are sturdy . It 's not an `` educational '' toy but it is a nice Fantasy Play toy and that 's a great toy in my opinion.We 're very happy with this toy and the others in the series that we bought . The Rescue Bots are good fun and durable .	1
This big vehicle transforms into a headquarters for other transformers . Stickers are also included to add to the controller room feel . The ladder has several functions and there is a small vehicle ( included ) launch . My son played with it for hours , along with his other Transformers . This set would be great for the 3-6 age range .	1
Great toy for the active child who wants to play like they are a real life hero . The toy is complex and maybe that is good since the child will have to figure out how to make things work . The childs imagination will be activated with the sounds , hidden compartments & trap doors . The toy is made of tough plastic which will be tested with all the hinged parts . Good toy for active kids .	1
This playset is another great Rescue Bots playset . It is a nice stand alone piece as well a good companion piece to the larger fire station playset.Here are some of the pros and cons as I and my son see them : Pros : *Lights and sounds - lots of neat effects . Actuate the sounds by extending the ladder , opening the playset , and launching mini-Optimus Prime . *Big wheels = easy to roll . *More than just a `` big truck '' - the set opens up to become a mini command center . *Drop and go action - raise the ladder and activate the trap door to drop Cody into Optimus and then push a level and send the pair on their way . Two gimmicks that work together is pretty fun . *Optimus Prim transforms , sort of . At least he transform more than Heatwave does in the larger set.*Cody . Finally , a key character from the show is included.Cons : *Stickers . A lot of the internal detail is achieved with stickers you have to apply . For an older kids toy this might be a feature as kids love stickers but for the toddler set this is designed it means work for mom or dad . * Optimus Prime . I LOVE Optimus , but I have to admit that he is n't in the show so including him feels a tad out of place . ( Yes , a very minor complaint I admit . ) *Price - my biggest con , the $ 40 MSRP seems high for what you get.Summary : This is a fun set that is doubly fun for fans of the show with my only serious complaint being the suggested retail price . That though is a personal opinion and each individual 's mileage will definitely vary . Happy playing .	1
My 6 year old son loves this toy . He has always loved cars and trucks , and recently has become more interested in Transformers . The toy comes with a Cody Burns figure and Optimus Prime vehicle , but my son also loves to add in some of his other transformers ( and even Star Wars ) figures . The toy seems sturdy and durable , and will provide plenty of imaginative play for my child .	1
This toy was a hit at our grandsons recent play date with friends ! He is only a year old but that did n't stop him from being fascinated with this Transformers Mobile truck . He and the other children were enthralled with this toy . They loved the sound effects made and were constantly transforming it . The older children , 3 & 5 , did more with the transforming but our grandson loved pushing it around and raising the ladder up and down . He also liked taking the smaller truck and placing it in the bigger one . It was great for helping him learn to use his little fingers . It is also very sturdy . I was concerned that the older children may break it as they were transforming it but it held up great ... .and they were definitely rough with it . This is a toy that our grandson can play with as he grows and can appreciate more about it as time goes on . He also loved the little action toy that came with it . Overall I give it a 5 .	1
This toy is very sturdy and feels nice and heavy , something that can be lacking in a lot of toys today . The `` Headquarters '' is fun and pops open . The inside is filled with trap doors and a controller room ... sounds and lights make it even more appealing . The launch feature is great . The action figure is also durable and articulated . The Optimus Prime is easy enough to `` transform '' for little hands . I use this in therapy with 3-5 year olds and they all really love it .	1
When my grandson comes over on weekends he loves running over and grabbing this one out of his playroom . So much for his imagination to take off with and he really likes the lights and sounds . This one is a winner in our house .	1
As soon as my seven and five year old opened the Transformers Rescue Bots Mobile Headquarters , they played with it for a good hour ! I was worried that it would be too young for them , but they still loved it.It 's great because my boys also have the Transformers Fire Station and this is a great accessory to go along with it . My boys love that it 's Transformers , the vehicle can easily switch to Optimus Prime ( and for toddlers , it 's not complicated like many Transformers ) , they can drop the Cody Burns figure into the vehicle from the mobile headquarters and the lights and sounds are just plain fun.As a parent , I love it because it 's durable , there are no small pieces , and the sounds are n't overbearing . I would highly recommend this for 3-5 year-olds .	1
Bought this for the three year old grandson , not having a clue what it was . Out of the box it was a Fire Rescue vehicle , but as those little tiny hands twisted and turned bits of plastic it turned into a robot like super hero . What the heck is that , I asked . And , in three year old dead serious babble , I got a two minute diatribe on exactly what it was and how important to world safety it is . I smiled .	1
I got this for my grandson to try out . While there is a warning that says not for children under age 3 , my 2 year-old grandson is more interested in making toys go than putting them in his mouth.When my daughter first opened the Amazon box , her son saw it ; he whispered , `` Wow ! '' and immediately tried to grab it ! She had a difficult time , getting this out of the box , because her son 's hands were all over it , trying to grab it from her . He pushed a button , it made a noise , he whispered `` Wow ! '' again . It did n't take him long to discover all its features ... Cody Burns , the robot , the firetruck with working wheels and ladder , lights and noises galore ! Each new discovery brought another `` Wow ! '' whispered in reverence.My daughter has a hard time finding anything that keeps his attention for more than a few minutes , before he 's off playing with the next toy . He played with this for almost an hour , and the only reason he stopped is he got tired when it was time for his nap.This is n't just for very young children either . As soon as his two older sisters ( age 7 and 9 ) saw their brother 's new toy , they rushed over to `` help '' him play . And as soon as he was down for his nap , they took over and had hours of fun with the www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008HYGFGE/ .	1
My son only played with this for about 5 mins.It could be because I stole it from him and had myself a `` Robots in Disguise '' good ol ' time ! This toy is AWESOME ! Blinking lights , sirens that go off - Optimus launches from the trailer ! AND , Yes , the super awesome , classic Transformer changing sound effects ! Long gone are the days you have to make the Transformer changing noise with your mouth . What ? I had a lot of Transformers as a kid . : /So highly recommended ! ( I eventually gave Optimus back to my son and he likes it too )	1
Waaaaay overpriced for what you get . Daughter wants it but I think she will be disappointed . Content is very thin despite bulky cover .	-1
A crappy cardboard ghost of the original . Hard to believe they did this , but they did . Shame on Hasbro . Disgusting .	-1
not that great a game . have only played like once or twice and do n't even know where it is now .	-1
We have this same game but it was made in 1967 , we just thought the newer version would be more up with the times but we like the old one much better ! ! This one the tiles are cardboard and the little stand to put your pieces on is also made of very cheap cardboard ! ! We just gave this game a way and kept our old one ! !	-1
I just had the opportunity to play the Dungeons and Dragons Castle Ravenloft game , and I have to say that I am disappointed . Reviews I have read implied that the game was somewhat of a cross between D & D ; 4th edition and Betrayal at House on the Hill ( an excellent cooperative game with multiple scenarios ) . I really wanted to like this game . Though not a fan of D & D ; 4th edition , I did consider that ruleset would make a great boardgame . Sadly , I found this game to be severely lacking.The way the game is structured , you have a scenario with a win condition known at the start of the game ( the sessions I played were an escort mission , and a quest to kill a dracolich ) . Players then take turns moving and exploring , with player turns working much like D & D ; turns . The exploration system is my primary problem with the game . You go to the edge of the board , and lay down a random tile . Every tile has a monster , and every monster immediately attacks the character . There is no opportunity for reaction , tactics , etc . There are several reasons why this is problematic.D & D ; characters have strengths and weaknesses . Take , for example , the wizard . A wizard 's strength is being able to attacks enemies from afar , often multiple ones . Their weakness is typically lack of ability to take damage , represented by a low hit point total . Castle Ravenloft 's Exploration/Encounter system heavily penalizes the wizard character for having fewer hit points than the other characters . We came to realize that this character was just not viable for playing.Another weakness is the Exploration/Encounter system , as I mentioned before . Every exploration reveals an enemy . And while it is nice that all players cooperate , the tactics they use largely make them feel the same.Another game that occupies this same conceptual space is Descent . Also a dungeon crawl game , Descent has one player operate as the Overlord , controlling the monsters . Its gameplay is smoother and more satisfying , but it does not play so quickly . A better horror exploration game that plays in a similar amount of time is Betrayal at House on the Hill ( mentioned earlier ) . Primarily cooperative , it uses a traitor mechanic that causes one player to unexpectedly betray the party , which sets into motion a story-driven scenario , where both the traitor and the rest of the players have distinct win conditions.To sum up , this is not a good game . There are planty of other good cooperative games to measure this against . The poorly-conceived systems diminish its playability , and its small number of scenarios limit its replayability . I would seriously consider either of the games previously mentioned above this .	-1
Hated this product.Predictable . Not fun . It attempts to be a fast setup table top game but feels as a meshed together mess of crap . Often times I thought & # 34 ; this seems like d & d ; battle ... . Just kidding & # 34 ; . We never played it again after one play through.Would not recommend this for an older gaming group that enjoys board/card ga , es like talisman and 7 wonders and ascension.F	-1
I had high hopes for this game , as I am a big fan of Fourth Edition D & D ; ( though if you like 3e , enjoy it ! I 'm not going to tell you one is better ; I 'll just tell you which one I prefer ) . I also enjoy games with modular tiles and such , so I really went into this game biased towards enjoying it.Sadly , all that could n't rescue this game . It is exceedingly repetitive . Play about 3 turns and you 'll get the entire experience this game has to offer - there will be nothing new or exciting for you . The game is hopelessly shallow , based on so much chance that strategy is non-existent . Despite the modular tiles , the game offers virtually no customization.The pieces seem to be well-made , and fortunately it might supply some use for actual D & D ; , since the store I bought it from does n't do returns . However , the quality of the pieces is not matched by the game itself.I really wanted to enjoy this game , so I played 5 whole games and an uncounted number of aborted attempts , before accepting the fact that it simply does n't work . Extremely disappointing .	-1
The quality of the pieces is really nice.But there is little interaction between the players and there is n't any rhyme or reason to the difficulties of the monsters and no way to improve your characters . So if you are just interested in a luck-fest , this is the game for you .	-1
I am devasted ! ! Got this for Christmas for a grandchild just received it and the box it completely ripped in back ! ! ! NOW what I am not rating for the puzzle but for the packaging ! Will you replace it or send a new one ... ... ... .	-1
thought this was a book with pages to illustrate for my 7 yr old son but no it is loose pieces of white paper with no binder to put together a book . very disappointing	-1
Started out as a great road trip activity for my 5 yro but after the 2 yro used it , it became a mess . The stix became stuck together or had hairs stuck to them . It does n't come with a reusable bag or anything so they are all stuck in a big ball to the top of the book right now - neither my kids nor I want to deal with organizing them .	-1
I thought there would be dashed lines or something to show where to add stuff in the book , but basically it 's just a picture book that you could stick stuff to . In addition , it did n't come with very many stix .	-1
I got this game as a present and the reaction was not so great even after playing it..too much luck involved	-1
I would love to give this a higher review . It seems like such a great concept and I was so excited to get it for my son . But the battery died 2 days after we got it and of course it takes a small expensive specialty battery . Not impressed .	-1
It did n't work when we bought it , a bummer because it was for our 8 year old son 's birthday and he loves to read & keep track of the time he reads for school .	-1
We got this as a gift recently . At first glance it sounded like a good idea , until I read the story.1 . The elf `` watches '' your kids and then tattletales on them to Santa . Really ? We teach our children not to tattletale . I do n't like the idea of anything , real or imaginary being a dedicated tattletale.2 . Religion . The elf makes sure you do your prayers . This is a non starter , we are not a religious family , so this book is basically written for Christians , but that seems to be the theme for the whole book.3 . Santa is a bad enough idea ( he is not `` real '' in our family , just a mythical figure for fun , like Frosty ) . But this elf is a tangible object and he is supposed to fly back to Santa every night and tattletale on your kids . This is insulting my myself and my kids.This story is basically just a reinforcement of the Santa mythos , `` do good or else you get no toys '' . I teach my kids to do good for good sake and the golden rule . I do n't want them to think they have to pretend to be good just for a reward or because some magic person is watching them . 'Be careful the elf , Santa or god ( s ) are watching you ! 'is a horrible thing to teach kids.The best fun we had with the elf was the fact that is is freaky looking and my four year old is scared to death of it in a Chucky sort of way . So we beat it up and play fetch with it with the dog just to make her laugh and not to fear it . After the holiday season I think I will just toss the elf in the garbage and donate the book.So in short , want to instill fear into your children , buy this product . Otherwise respect their intelligence and invent something new - not just the repackaged Santa story . I 'm sure the inventors have made millions on this crap , do n't add to it .	-1
Here 's a creepy little elf and a book . If you want the elf to cook and buy all the accessories its like buying skylanders or Disney xfinity . Every little extra thing costs at least 20.00 . This is awful quality too . I would not recommend thistle anyone . Save your money and buy a nice advent calendar instead - I suggest a LEGO advent calendar !	-1
My Grandson got this and because of the movie , he got this one , but all my Great Grands got one cheaper and IMHO better because the arms and legs were wire and extremely posable . However , my Grandson ( 9 yrs old ) loved this elf and his Momand Dad had fun using the concept during the Holidays .	-1
I Love the idea of this but did n't like the story . We will do the elf with our own version of the story without the naughty or nice aspect . I am not comfortable telling my child that santa will not come if he is & # 34 ; naughty & # 34 ; . We will encourage striving for the & # 34 ; nice & # 34 ; behavior without threats . Is there really any parent out there who would actaully follow through with withholding presents in the case of undesirable behavior ? I really hope not so why make the threat . Think intrinsic motivation not extrinsic ...	-1
I was super excited to open up my Party Gras game at my party . I thought it would be a lot of fun but it was a little too simple to keep people interested . The entire premise of the game is you all start off with the same amount of beads and you pick a task from a limited amount of cards to try to get other people to do . If they do the task then you get their beads . There are not a lot of cards so if you want repetitive play it wo n't last long because you will have the advantage over everyone else because you will know all of the cards . Many of the tasks are really simple and does not keep your attention so it gets boring really quickly . Also you must have 4 players to play this game so if you have a small family and just want to play it will not work.This game is fun for a little but I think it is more suited to be an icebreaker game for people who want to get to know each other .	-1
This game looked like fun but after trying it , I quickly lost interest . I like board games but this one was not my taste . It had too many parts and a bit complicated to play . I suppose if you love Mardi Gras with a passion , then you may like the game . At this time of writing my review it ranked 171,212 of games and toys . I would not suggest buying Party Gras unless you are a real Mardi Gras person or having a theme party . The target audience for this game is low . I give it a do n't buy at any price.I rarely give a One Star on any review , but this is not what I expected . I ca n't say anything good about it and I do n't recommend this game .	-1
When I broke out Party Gras for the first time , it seemed like it could be a fun addition to a party . Just as quickly , people did n't care about the game and it broke up the flow.The `` game '' is simple , you try to do tasks on cards and when you do , you get more Mardi Gras style beads . Sadly , the game does n't function as a game on its own and when combined with other games or a party , it simply becomes a hassle . Essentially there will be one person really into it , going around collecting beads while ruining everyone else 's attempt to enjoy the party.It is a fine idea in theory , but the reality of playing it is rather painful .	-1
It took forever for me to write this review simply because you have to have a minimum of four people in order to play it . I intially tried to make it work with just two people that is simply not possible with this game . Fortunately the holidays rolled around and we had enough people stop by the house to make the attempt . I must emphasis the word attempt because after 5 minutes of explaining the `` rules '' no one was really engaged in the `` play '' aspect . I think this game is much more well-suited for people who do not know each other well in an `` icebreaker '' /conference setting . There was much rolling-of-the-eyes and are you kidding me ? responses from those who were gamely trying to make this work . It was quite frankly , not that much fun . As I mentioned previously , this would be a great game to use as an icebreaker for facillitators . I belive that would make this game much more of a `` party '' .	-1
I so wanted to love this game . I 'm a massive fan of the series and the movies as well . And I saw so many good reviews that I did n't hesitate to buy this game . Unfortunately I 'm not sure what all the five star reviews are for . Maybe because the game is so thematically beautiful . It really is . Oh well , let 's get to breaking it all down.Theme : 5 Stars . They 100 % nailed the theme here . All of the , & # 34 ; oh yeah ! I remember that episode ! & # 34 ; moments are here . And it 's fun to relive them . Also they balanced the characters very well . Mal is great at fighting challenges and even can hold his own when it comes to persuasion . Also I love the way they handled companions in the game too . Very well designed ! Mechanics : 4 stars . This is a solid hit too . They have different decks you buy from when you head to a certain place , like Silverhold or Athens . Also there are different job givers ( good old Badger ) spread across the board as well . Do legal jobs , and you do n't incur any danger . But you also make almost no money . Do illegal or immoral jobs for a high payout ! Also there are two decks you have to flip cards from when you are flying in either Alliance or Border space . Good mechanic because it allows for all the danger of navigating the black to show through.Gameplay : 0 Stars . And here is where the game comes to a 'monkeys must be loose in the engine room ' halt . The designers say the game is sandbox style . Go anywhere . Do anything you want . Sure . And loose while other people just do the exact strategy to win . First game we played , I was surprised at how few turns it took for someone to win the game . He got 3 delivery jobs . Did some muck work , and paid Niska . Wham , bam , thank you maam . Kiss your dear fluffy lord goodbye . Ok , maybe that was a fluke . Game 2 . Almost the same results . But this time with a different player . We even tried to stop him . I flew around in border space till I could get the Reavers on the Hunt card so another buddy of mine could intercept him . Yeah , crew dead , he does n't care . Still pays Niska and wins . Ugh.So maybe that was just a coincidence . We get together another time and play one of the other box scenarios . And I learn how to break the game and win every time . Do you want to know how to do it ? Seriously , in the next couple sentences I will spoil the game for you , and give you the secret to winning . Are you sure you want to know ? Yes ? Yes ? SPOILER ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Go to either Badger or Amnon Duul and consider jobs , do crap work ( collect $ 200 ) till you get three either delivery jobs , or low misbehave jobs ( 1 card or 2 at the most ! ) . Go hire some crew ( Silverhold is a pretty good place ) . Complete the jobs . Repeat ad nauseam . Lame . But there you go . And yes it does work . Since I discovered that strategy I HAVE N'T LOST A GAME ! And I played with new and seasoned players . That is the biggest letdown in the world.Also some of our other players were really frustrated by the fact that all it takes is one lousy card to completely wreck your game . Hit the card that draws the Reaver or Alliance ship to you , and by the draw of one stupid card you can straight up loose ! Another annoyance , Niska jobs suck ! Sure they pay a lot . But they take a very varied skill set crew or you wo n't be able to beat all the misbehave cards you will have to draw . Also you do n't make that much more in the long run . Doing the slightly lesser but way less risk jobs is the way to go.I know this review will probably garner me a lot of down votes . But I do n't care . I 'm a huge gamer through and through and I hope to warn other people to avoid this game . Thematically it is brilliant and beautiful . But in the play , it is way less than shiney . I have boxed this game and will move on to other bigger and better games.But to leave the review on a positive note , I will leave you with some words of wisdom from captain Mal : You can learn all the math in the 'verse ... but you take a boat in the air that you do n't love ... she 'll shake you off just as sure as the turn of the worlds . Love keeps her in the air when she ought to fall down ... tells you she 's hurting before she keels . Makes her a home . ( Browncoats forever )	-1
I do n't get it- you have to carry around the board and the pen ... what is the difference between this and simply bringing a pen and pad of paper ? I was disappointed . After reading all of the great reviews , I guess I expected something special ! We played it a few times when we first got it , but since then it has been sitting untouched ( for about six months ) . However , we frequently play the `` old-fashioned '' hangman in waiting rooms , restaurants , etc . ... when it just is n't convenient to carry around the board . Overall , a waste of money !	-1
My granddaughter Abigail had to have the new Abby Cadabby doll . She 's very well put together for my two year old to carry around every where she goes . We both love her .	-1
This game is fun at first , but the gameplay is too simple to hold your interest for long , some cards ( especially some of the newer cards in the expansions ) are wayyy too powerful , and you will find yourself falling into a tedious rhythm of back-and-forth ganging up on whomever is currently in the lead . Do not , I repeat , do NOT buy any of the expansions until you 're absolutely sure you 're in love with this game and want to keep playing it for years . They do n't add much to the game and will require that you carefully trim your deck down to something manageable , as having a huge stack of door and treasure cards means that you wo n't even go through the deck once during a single game ( something which is part of the flavor when you only have the original deck ) .	-1
I know I 'll be lambasted by the game 's rabid followers for this , but to be honest this game looks simple but it 's really convoluted for a card game . It just does n't move fluidly and while its fans will rave about its mechanics , it 's actually very unbalanced and wonky . While the cards will make you smile it 's not the `` laugh riot '' some have claimed . It can have it 's moments ( so 2 stars ) but its generally frustrating and not fun , especially when compared to a far superior card game like Dominion , Gloom , or yes even Magic where things move fluidly and fun is had . Also while not part of my score , I 'm also not a fan of the game 's art . I understand that it 's supposed to look slapstick , but it 's also kind of a cop out . Some effort could have been put into it and still creating a fun feel .	-1
Especially if you have a ton of expansions . I can see this being your first expansion and it being really fun ; but I 've got all of them and it just makes it more confusing . Which is hard because I 'm the only one who knows all the rules .	-1
I thought my one year old would be super into this , he loves sticking things into slots . However he is barely interested in it . Partly because someone has to hold down the flimsy foam bottom while putting them in . And you have to push them in really hard into the foam to get them to stay , which he still can hardly do at almost 2 . Then you still have to push fairly hard to put them on top of each other , though they still stand up somewhat if you do n't click them in all the way . We are disappointed as there were many of these types of things to choose from and I am sure some of the others are better . And they are definitely overpriced .	-1
This book contains lead ! Do not give it to your little ones ! I read that in the customer reviews on Little Hands Love book and googled it and this book has lead , too	-1
I had this done with my girls and a few days . Wish they would make a thicker book like they do with there phonics . This workbook has very few worksheets in it so just letting people know . I would not waste my money on it .	-1
A very macabre game with an interesting premise and unique implementation . The transparent cards have great novelty value , but the fact that they all look alike from a distance makes it really tough to tell if someone is correctly following the rules ( some cards say & # 34 ; you ca n't do or must do certain things if this card is on top of one of your people & # 34 ; ) , and the lack of differentiation makes it really easy for you to forget both positive and negative effects of the cards currently in play on the family directly in front of you ! If you tell a narrative as you 're playing it helps a bit with engagement , but I feel that some of the effect cards are simply way too powerful . It 's too easy for a lucky draw to completely turn the tide of the game .	-1
So my boyfriend and I are pretty snobby about our games . And Gloom did n't really pass muster despite good recs . We played with 4 people ( but we played will the full families , which was a mistake ) and our game just kept going on forever . The instructions are not very clear . The fact that all your strategy can be wiped away with a single blow of a single card from someone else is annoying.We felt like we were missing a good deal of cards , though when we realized the instructions suggested that with 4 players you should have 4 total family members , that alleviated some of our icky feeling about the game . This is something where it feels like the expansion packs are really necessary to give the game that extra emphasis and enjoyability , which feels deceptive.Other thing : the & # 34 ; storytelling & # 34 ; is quite irrelevant to the actual mechanics of the game ; you get no points for the quality of your story and while you are technically encouraged to integrate your family members ' stories with those of the other players ' families , it has zero effect on the game.There is actually disincentive to be interesting , because the shorter your turn and the quieter you are about your character , the less the other players notice how many points you are racking up on your character.Basically we wished we ended our gaming party with CAH and not gotten out Gloom , because it made all of us quite Gloomy .	-1
I played Citadels three times , two with the regular rules and once with the included expansion cards , and all three games with max ( or close to max ) players . I did n't like it very much any time I played it . The game always drags toward the end and feels too long by 15-30 minutes . The most frustrating part is the high probability of the other players targeting you every turn ( regardless of which character you pick to play , which can change every turn , but is often easy to figure out who is going to be who ) . If you get targeted , you could lose your turn ( assassin ) , gold ( thief ) , districts ( warlord ) or special ability ( witch ) , none of which is any fun . It makes some characters impossible to choose no matter how much you need their special ability , because you know the other players will target them ( especially the witch from the expansion , who steals their special ability and gets to go first ) . I like competitive strategy games but Citadels was simply too cut-throat for me . The game 's artwork and production values are excellent , except for the gold coins , which are really just unpunched butterscotch-colored buttons and look it . For me , the unpunched buttons were a real letdown after the realistic ( if tiny ) gold coins that came withRio Grande Games Dominion : Seaside . My preference for competitive card games suitable for the whole family would be forDominion , which you can customize to increase or decrease the number of attack cards ( even down to zero if you prefer ) and is never the same game twice . Citadels is always the same boring game , even though you get random district cards and ca n't always be the same character every turn .	-1
This card game has a few flaws . The cards do not fit in standard card protectors ( have to use some obscure sized protectors ) if you want to lengthen the life of the cards . The game play lacks much if you have played Dominion or any other similar style card game . I think if you have never played Dominion it might be a really fun game , but after having played dominion or any other similar game , this game just feels shallow . Game play becomes predictable quickly in small groups and is only made slightly better by adding more players . Replay value is low at best since there are no expansions or different occupations to mix in and out of the game . Save your money and learn a card game with more variety .	-1
First of all , I always wanted to play this game and was thrilled when a member of our game night group decided to purchase and learn how to play it , as to teach the rest of us . That is the only positive thing I can say about the experience . We played a competitive game with 7 people , and all I can say was that after the first hour of 5 and 1/2 hours of play most of us were trying to figure out how to kill our characters off so we could stop the game and lose . Unfortunately , like the horror that it is , it will not let you do that because the weaker you get , the weaker the games monsters get . I do n't know if that is an intentional mechanic of the game or just the way it turned out for our play , but it seems the game is determined to make you go through the hell of playing for the entire night and most of the next morning just to get it over with . We started at 9 p.m. and did not finish ( and we actually beat the game mind you ) until 4 a.m. the next morning ; and remember we already had a person who knew how to play leading us through , so it was not like we spent hours setting up and getting started , that actually only took about 45 min . ( which , is in my opinion a deal breaker for any game , set up should be easy and take no more than 5-10 min. , max , if you know how to play , 20-30 min . max for first time ) , the rule book alone is almost 30 pages long and do n't expect a quick start or `` idiots '' guide to help it get moving , cuz there aint one . This game is so convoluted and without plot that building any kind of strategy is pointless , and there is no real storyline to get into or pass the time . Most of the time , whenever you do face something , it will knock you down to almost nothing before you even get a chance to fight it , so you are unlikely to be successful , most of the locations on the game require funds and achievements that take hours to get in order to get what the site offers . The mechanics are so flawed/boring that most of the time the players are sitting in the `` Nether Regions '' twiddling their thumbs for 30-45 minutes ( usually two or more rounds ) , waiting to get to do something because their character has been `` KO 'd '' or they are attempting to close a gate . The end was very anti-climatic and occurred with little action or fan fair . If you think this game looks like fun I would suggest finding someone else who has it and play it with them first before you spend the money , or purchase A Touch of Evil from Flying Frogs productions which is this same basic game with all of the stupid , repetitive , boring , pointless , convolutions and bad mechanics removed and therefor much more fun to play and far less time consuming . I mean really , 5.5 hours ? I would not want to play my favorite game of all time ( which is a Flying Frog game by the way , Fortune and Glory ) for 5.5 hours . The board in this game is too large and the writing is too small , so you spend half the night standing up looking over the shoulder of your fellow gamers , trying to read what occurs at each location , to figure out if it is worth traveling to that site . The board is also very non-descript and unattractive and you better have a very large table to play it on because there is a lot of crap that needs to be on the table at one time for this game , I can not even imagine how large and drug out the expansions for this game would make it . Again , my advice would be let someone else sport the bill for this one and play with them or get A Touch of Evil instead if you want a fun night of gaming . But , if you enjoy wishing you could have the last 5.5 hours of your life back after the fact , and I guess there is some Lovecraftian masochism to that , than by all means ignore my recommendation and purchase this game . If you are a diehard Lovecraft fan and just love anything that has to do with the Cthulhu mythos , no matter how entertaining it is , or is n't , than I suppose you might like this game ; only one person in our group falls into the category of that big of Lovecraft fan , so we do not . As a last thought , just to let you know , our group is a hardcore gaming group , that plays everything from D & D to Clue , so it is not the fact that we are not up to games of this magnitude , in fact we love convoluted and complicated , as long as it is fun and has a purpose beyond just being convoluted and complicated , this game is and does neither .	-1
I initially enjoyed playing this game due to the co-op nature and how intriguing/random it is but as I 've played it more and more , I 've begun to dislike it more and more . There is so much happening with the game but the payoff is rarely worth it . I 'll play it if my group is playing it but otherwise , I want nothing to do with it.Basic Play - You select a character , your choice or at random , and get all equipment/money they are entitled to . Select a random Ancient One to battle . You spend the rest of the game navigating the board looking for clues , buying items , getting skills/spells/allies , fighting enemies and going into portals to close/seal them . Your character card has stats you can change at the beginning of every turn . For example , you can increase your ability to move around the board faster but this decreases your ability to sneak past enemies . You can increase your luck but this decreases your lore . Each character has their own individual max/minimums for each stat , starting stuff , and special ability that makes them unique . Almost everything you do in this game will be done with dice . Rolling a 5 or 6 is a success while a 1-4 is a fail . You might enter a room and have to make a luck check , so you 'll see what your character 's luck rating is and get that many dice to roll . One 5 or 6 and you 're good but if you get none than you fail . There are cards and other things that can modify your abilities . Enemies require that you do all damage at once to kill them . So if an enemy has 3 life and you get 2 hits , he takes no damage and hits you and next round you will have to get 3 hits still to kill it . You ca n't team up in combat with another player , even though this is a co-op game , to kill an enemy . All battles are one on one , except the final battle , if it happens . If you die at any point in the game , you simply re-spawn and lose half your items . It is possible to be devoured , in which case your character is permanently dead and you select a new character and come back onto the board with all their starting stuff ( it is often better to be devoured then killed ) . There are a ton of locations to visit in the game , all of them have a set of 7 cards that you pick one from at random to see what happens to you . Some locations have special text on them where you can choose to do what the text says rather than draw a random card , such as the item shops or medical areas . All players will go and then at the end of every round , a portal gate will open , if possible , and bring out monsters , if possible , and make monsters move , if possible . You win the game if you close all gates ( certain restrictions apply ) , seal 6 or more gates ( by using 5 clue tokens or a special item ) , or kill the ancient one if he awakens . You lose if the ancient one awakens ( which can happen multiple ways ) and you fail to defeat him.Components - This game just has way too many pieces . The board is huge , you will need a large table to play this on , especially if you get any of the expansions that make the board even larger . The board itself is nice to look at and well made . There are 16 large character cards and 8 ancient one cards to select from each game . They look nice and have unique stories for each of the characters on the back . There are 196 token pieces , 189 different cards your characters can acquire ( split into 11 piles ) , 179 ancient one cards ( split into 3 piles , the location pile will be split into 9 different piles ) , 60 monster tokens , 16 gate tokens and at least 30 more random tokens/markers/dice . On the plus side , everything looks nice and it 's unlikely anything will get worn out or damaged . On the negative side , you need a ton of room to place all this stuff , and then you need more room for each person playing the game . Also , the cards your characters can acquire are the smaller , annoying , hard to shuffle style of cards ( such as Ticket to Rides train car cards ) . The rulebook is large and it is 24 pages . It is somewhat rough to get through and you 'll have to check back multiple times during your first couple playthroughs , probably even in some later playthroughs . There are no gameplay sheets to hand out to players , which you 'll want and need , so make sure you go online and find a friendly gameplay sheet to print out for players , you can find them at BoardGameGeek . The insert for the game is ok . I do n't think they provided any baggies so you 'll want to get some to put all the different pieces in.Length - This game takes a long time , especially your first couple playthroughs . Expect setup to take you about 15-30 minutes since you have to select characters , enemies , distribute starting items/cash/skills/life/sanity/etc , then you have to shuffle each deck of cards , play a starting mythos card and place the gate and enemies . The actual game itself will run at least 4 hours for your initial play-through . It still regularly takes my group 2 1/2 - 3 hours to play a game . I 'm the guy that actually keeps the game moving because I want to get through it . They tried playing it once without me and it took them over 5 hours because they could n't stay focused.Re-playability - This is one of the big positives of the game . There is a lot of re-playability due to all the characters , ancients ones ( that have various effects on monsters and gameplay ) , and just the random nature of the game . Game win/loss conditions change depending on the number of players , along with how many monster spawns and other various rules.Luck - Almost everything you do in this game requires you to roll dice . There is a ton of luck . I 've watched 11 dice come up with no successes and 3 dice get 3 successes . Every location card you draw has something random happen at the location that could be good or bad . You might have your lore skill maxed out ( which leaves you with little to no luck ) and draw a helpful/hurtful card that requires lore to pass . Of course , you might draw a card that requires luck to pass and you do n't get to roll at all if you have no luck . Also , most cards take a die or two away from whatever skill check you are making . Monsters only move if the mythos card drawn at the end of each turn say so . So if you go into a room and a monster blocks the exit , you have to either fight or sneak past . Some monsters are extremely difficult to kill and some are difficult to sneak past , some have both . So if one of those tough to sneak/fight monsters is blocking your room , enjoy being stuck in there for the next couple turns . There are also random cards that just cause you to die/get devoured , so enjoy that as well.Interaction - There is surprisingly little interaction needed for this game . You might give someone an item once a game or use a special power to help someone but for the most part , everyone just kind of does there own thing . You ca n't team up to fight monsters or close/seal gates . Most of the interaction will just be game banter.Thoughts pros - Hard to think of a lot at this point . There is a ton of theme . Can play 1-8 players . Components are all good quality and look nice . A lot of things you can do , characters and bad guys to pick . The co-operative aspect is nice , I guess.Thoughts cons - Can someone show me where the fun is ? It takes a while to slog thorough and is just way to random . It 's rough to teach to new players , you 're better off just playing and hoping they pick up as they go along . The rules are annoying to remember . There are many rules that change depending on the number of people playing , so you have to look those up each game . Even after many playthroughs , using cheat sheets , I 'm pretty sure we still have a rule or two wrong . The co-op aspect is n't really used that often . Occasionally someone will give an item away but most of the time it 's just spent deciding which gate someone is going to go into . Everyone pretty much just does their own thing ; and I 've sat in one location for the majority of the game doing nothing and we still win most of the time . I 've also found that there is very little strategy required . The game gives you all of these options but I 've found it breaks down to 4 different things . 1 . If you have 5 clues or the item that seals a gate , go into a gate . 2 . If you ca n't close a gate and have money , go to the special item store and try to buy the item that automatically seals a gate ( I think there are 3 or 4 of them in the special item deck ) . 3 . If you have no money , run around and pick up clues . 4 . If you have no money and there are no clues , just sit in a room where you have a good shot at earning clues/money . For example , of the 7 cards for the newspaper location , some give you money with no rolling , some give a luck ( -1 ) check for a clue and one gives you a lore ( -1 ) check for 3 clues . So you just sit in that room and earn money or clues and then use whatever you earned . Using this strategy , I 've only lost 2 of about 10+ we 've played . There have been a couple last turn thrillers where we won , but other than that , not much fun here . There are some locations that have almost no purpose . It is extremely rare that someone goes to the common item shop and buys a common item , or goes to the magic shop to buy magic , or goes to the skill area to buy a skill . You 're better off just trying to draw the special item that lets you seal a gate . Some location cards wo n't be drawn because there is no purpose to going there , I 've never seen anyone draw a location card for the hospital , magic shop , common item shop , church , boarding house or curiositie shoppe . There is no reason to visit these spots outside of their special text options . Certain mythos cards have text on them titled `` environment '' that cause effects that alter the game ( all players get +1 luck/-1 lore , or no spells can be cast , etc ) and these can be annoying to remember sometimes . Combat also is n't that interesting . Most of the time , your character will fit one of two molds , decked out for combat or do n't bother fighting anything that has more than one life . Also , enemies are very uneven , there only seem to be 2 difficulties , ridiculously easy or ridiculously hard . There are very few that fall in between . You 'll probably have one player who just runs around killing enemies . Sometimes you 'll let yourself get killed or get devoured because it 's beneficial . I should n't get rewarded for dying.I was n't sure whether I wanted to give this a 3 or 2 stars , but what decided it for me was that I 'll enjoy playing a 3 star game once and a while , but this game , I just want it to be over as soon as possible . I do n't like Pandemic , but I will play that over this any time . This game just takes too long to setup ( I 'd rather setup Axis & Allies ) and play for the little payoff it gives and there are too many cards/pieces . I do n't mind longer games but there needs to be entertainment or a payoff in the gameplay and there is neither in this game . The game is n't hard , it 's just random . Everything is too random and you 're at the mercy of the dice . There is next to no strategy or thinking required , you just hope something random does n't happen to screw you . There are too many fiddly rules and too many pieces to fiddle with , even some monsters have to be removed from the group of monsters because they 're only used if a specific ancient one is in play . You 've got to remember what special power the ancient one gives enemies plus environments and events . People that love this game seem to love it for the theme . I guess that 's ok , but for me , theme , presentation etc ... mean very little if the core gameplay is n't good . I 'd much rather play generic themed game with ugly looking components that has interesting/good gameplay than this game . There is just nowhere near enough good things about this game to make up for the many negatives of the game . I think I 'd rather play Risk than this game . At least I can spread myself thin in Risk and get killed to end the suffering , this just goes on and on . I 'm tired of playing this game , I 'm either not going to play it from now on or just play my 3DS or read a book while playing , at least then I 'll feel like I 'm doing something entertaining . Overall , I have to give this game a 3/10 .	-1
I had great expectations from all the position 4 and 5 star reviews of this game . I have a few board based fantasy games like Descent and Heroscape , both great games giving hours of replayability , and obviously high quality of design and materials . This one disappoints . All of the pieces give the word MINIATURE and new definition . The pieces are so small they are in the description realm of RIDICULOUS . FFS is obviously saving dollars in name of sacrificing quality and quantity . Some of the pieces , like the plastic gold coins and the pyramind cones are literally 1/4 '' in height and diameter . The handful of plastic molded characters are at most about 1 inch high as well . The spell and casting cards are all so small they would be small for a 5 year old 's hand . The board is quite large , about 3 foot by 2 made of cardboard . Not much here folks , especially for the cost of the game . This is a 12 dollar game at a 50 dollar price .	-1
Well , this game is based on most popular game warhammer 40K , which I played in pervious 15 years and I also have space hulk since 2nd edition . I like the art work on this card game , and wish this game to be portable space hulk . Sadly , no ... ... This game is soso . You do need 13+ for this game as it listed on the box due to the complicated setting , and there is n't any armor save , special weapon , and combat experience as warhammer 40K . Most likely , it 's a game with 2 monsters `` broodlord & genestealer '' . Rolling 4+ to kill gensteraler and 5+ to kill broodlord per a 6 sides dice . Each space marines has different attacking range from 0 to 3 . If you get stormbolter mark as supplement , you get a chance to reroll . The game end when space marines all died , or run out of location card with having done the assignment of last location card . It 's very simple , but there are location and event cards , not easy for players to image the whole area as space hulk board game.After trying couple runs with friends , we gave up this game . It 's not fun as we expected . Not with the experience as warhammer 40K and the space hulk board game . It a card game without the spirit of warhammer 40k , but art work ... ..	-1
As noted in my other relevant game reviews , I 'm I am always looking for games I can play with my fiance . She is what some would call a `` reluctant gamer '' whereas I am an avid gamer , so I have be careful about what games I introduce her to . She prefers games that rely at least a little on luck ( i.e. , not all strategy ) and are n't too complex ( i.e. , where you can learn/remember the mechanic after a game or two ) , whereas I love strategy and complexity but do n't mind a little luck . We also like games you can finish in a single session ( or games you can play multiple times in a single session ) This game fit the bill perfectly.Based on what I 've read about this game on Amazon and BoardGameGeek this one seemed like a real contender . And , there were many things we liked about this game . We liked the theme -- you really feel like you are going on a journey ( and that you got to play familiar characters and see lots of familiar faces and places along the way ) , the fact that it is cooperative , and the fact that we had n't played anything quite like it before . And , I know lots of other people enjoy the game , and I by no means mean any disrespect to them by giving it a two star rating.But , after playing it twice with her ( and a third time with two gamer friends ) , we all felt the exact same way ... it just did n't feel very enjoyable to us . Most of the game play was good but not great ( probably 3.5 stars ) , but the ending was main problem . After all your hard work ( and assuming you are lucky enough to get to the end in the first place ) , whether you win or lose often comes down to a simple dice roll . This was very anticlimactic . No game should end that way.Given that there are also ways to lose along the way ( in fact , it is quite possible you 'll never get to the end ... which was not a big problem as seeing how far you get each time can be a worthwhile challenge in and of itself ) , it seemed to us that if you get to the end something besides a random dice roll should determine the outcome of the game . At best ( if things went very well along the way ) , you may get to make multiple dice rolls which can increase your chances of winning . But , ultimately a dice roll will decide your fate .	-1
This game has serious flaws which Fantasy Flight refuses to address . I have owned it for over a year now and they are in denial or simply do n't care about the problems it has . The Lannisters are completely broken and it basically ruins the fun of the game . FF is usually a great company but they drop the ball on this product in both the original edition and now again in this one . I would not recommend this game to anyone and it sits on my shelf gathering dust . It is a great concept and an amazing genre , but the broken aspects of the game ( Lannisters are far to weak and Stark/Baratheon are FAR too strong ) make the game boring and unplayable .	-1
Other than being very pretty , I do n't get why this game has such high reviews . This is coming from someone who loves LOTR and MTG .	-1
The most fun part of a little girl 's diary is the lock , and this one is difficult to manipulate and of poor quality . Also , the diary has only lined , blank pages ; there are no pages that are pre-formatted with questions or prompts for the child to enter fun information about herself . Next time , I will pay a little more for a higher-quality product .	-1
After buying this base set and 3 add-on expansions , I regret it . I heard it was one of the best in it 's class and have always loved the Fantasy theme especially in board/card games , so I bought it . ( Side note : I played the regular rules and then the Tom Vasel `` Epic Thunderstone '' rules as well . ) I guess now after other complex card games have come out , it 's easy to be down or negative on this historical game . For it was the 3rd game to come out in this genre as a `` deck-builder '' type game and still be different from classic , popular and all powerful Magic the Gathering card game.What is nice is that you do n't have to take out a large loan to buy this game ( like Magic ) . Instead it has a rather large amount of cards right in the box ready to be played . I do enjoy fantasy based games and video games so I was hoping this would fit my desires , but sadly this game falls incredibly flat.Quality : The cards have a nice raised textured pattern to them and fairly thick . The box is thick with a very nice insert to help you organize the cards . It all has a nice quality and will probably stand up over time . My only concern here is , much of the cards are surrounded by black ink and if you scratch or `` nick '' the cards , it is very visible ( and does n't look good ) .Art/Graphics : I have listened to other game reviews `` rave '' about the art , and until recent expansions of this game , I do not agree with the others . I do not like the art ( especially the base set ) and think it is n't up to the standards of the rest of the gaming world . Some cards they are down-right comical . Not to mention some of the art does not match and looks like another game entirely and very different styled artists were employed to create it.Price/Value : This game is very overpriced . For the amount of cards you get and the thickness of the box and it 's nice insert , it 's more worth $ 20-30 , but not the asking price.Base mechanics : Basically deck building games imply that you are BUILDING your hand in order to be able to do actions on your turn ( e.g . slay a monster or buy a good weapon ) . In many other games ( such as the video game World of Warcraft or Skyrim ) you can customize your character in order to be successful at your deeds . Collecting weapons and `` heroes '' , only serve to give you attack points or buying points . For a hero really is n't a HERO in Thunderstone . This hero is just a number on a card with some art . You could have pasted a factory worker on the card trying to repair a broken down assembly line , because the theme and actions seem completely `` pasted on '' .On your turn , you use 6 cards in your hand to do buying or attacking ... that 's it . If you do n't have the right cards drawn on your turn , you may or may not do anything . However , simply to the point , the game ends up being is a `` gathering card '' game . As soon as you see your opponent killing monsters ( and getting victory points in the process ) it 's a sprint for the finish line . It does n't feel like a game , and at times the game felt like it was playing me . Thunderstone has very little strategy and much too much chance/luck involved . Thunderstone seems like an advanced version of Dominion which is a hugely boring game to me.To End : I should try and sell mine on Ebay where I 'd get a great price for it . But I am probably going to keep it for those friends who want a think-less non-complicated game . Thunderstone is so flat and `` outright nothingness '' to it 's core mechanics , that I am incredibly surprised this game is so popular . There is so many better games out there , that you would be better off with another one of them . For example , Lord of the Rings Living Card Game and/or Mage Knight are similar in theme and both are card games , yet they both have real consequences to what you do and real strategy that require you to think things through and make good decisions.In the end , `` to each his own '' , and this game does n't appeal to me or involve `` fun '' . However , do n't take my word for it , be very careful and watch some youtube videos on how it 's played before you buy ... you 'll be glad you did the extra research .	-1
I installed fresh batteries in the robot and started it up . Looked briefly at the manual and realized programming it actually would n't be that hard . Just tell it to do a quick 1 foot square . So I entered the necessary info ( it 's really not as hard as other reviewers make it sound - or maybe they 're just not accustomed to toys like this ) and told it to run the program . The robot was supposed to go straight for one foot . It went slooooooooooooowly to the right . One of the side tracks was n't moving at all . In fact , that specific side did n't move at all during the whole program.I inspect the non-moving track and even tried to make it budge a little . I even checked the batteries just to see if I had bought ones that were drained . They were n't . I tried to get the robot to run the program again . Same thing . It barely moved and what movement it did make was slightly to an angle . To put it simply , the unit was broken.The concept of this robot seems interesting . I could see this as stepping stone for a child . It would help , however , if it actually worked .	-1
MoM has excellent looking pieces , clear rules and a modular system that should support replayability ... but the core concept of players vs a DM just does n't work . Simply put , it 's very difficult to get invested when 1 player ( the DM ) has a turn on every players turn , plus his own , and generally has little trouble stomping out your hopes for victory . And there lies the problem ( as best I can tell ) that the DM is n't really supposed to try to win - his or her job is really just to flavor the story and lead the players along . Unfortunately , that 's ill communicated in the rules and hard for most players to grasp and the result is a game where 2-4 players get to do very little while 1 player interrupts their turns and , after an hour or so , wins the game.Not a problem if your group goes in with the right mindset , but not really fun at all without that .	-1
Again , like Arkham Horror , I really looked forward to playing this game , and once again I was terribly disappointed . If you like playing games where all you do is roll dice all night long trying to get a certain combination play D & D , if you want to do that a be really bored play this . Literally , all you do in this game is roll dice trying to get some combination required on each card that gets progressively harder with each successful role in order to obtain a few objects on the card that really do nothing as far as helping you win the game other than the elder signs . However , by the time you actually manage to collect any of these the monster will have already woke up so they will be of no use to you because then it will just come down to rolling dice to see if you can inflict enough damage to kill it before it kills you . The only upside to this game is it was over in about 45 min . instead of the 5.5 hours its big brother Arkham Horror took .	-1
So , this is a star wars game , if you like star wars you will most likely buy this . If you like playing fun games then this is not the game you want to buy . I have played it about 5 times and hopefully will never play it again . At its heart it is a dive rolling game , that is pretty much it . You roll dice , move your ship along a card board strip and roll the dice again . Yeah , save your money and get King of Tokyo instead , if you are looking for fun in a dice rolling game .	-1
I thought these were made of metal , they are a in fact made of a cheap plastic material which after some use I feel will easily break .	-1
The only reason that they can even justify selling this pack is because they do n't include enough dice in the core pack to begin with . If they had included just one more of each die in the core set you 'd be fine . A marketing scam if you ask me .	-1
When these are in stock in game stores you can get this set for $ 5 , apparently the fact that they are in between runs makes all the game shops feel like they should screw the customers . $ 20 for this set is outlandish , at that price I would say just go ahead and flip for the additional $ 10 and get a whole other starter set . That way you get the dice and an extra x-wing and two ties to go with it . My suggestion is at this price , stay away and just play with the ones that came with it . It is not ever necessary to have the extra dice they are only a convenience and at $ 20 not a very good one . There will be another run of these here soon ( late April-June ) and all of you with out the patience to wait will be kicking your self for paying such a stupid price . At the $ 5 price I would give this a 4 star rating because they are nice to have and make game play faster but at $ 20 , no way . It is time we all start teaching these stores that price gouge that it will not pay , by us as customers not giving in and paying their outrageous prices . Just wait , they will be inexpensive again , just like the Millennium Falcon and the Tie interceptors will be .	-1
My eight year old is entering his first science fair , thus we have been experimenting with various potential projects . I bought him this kit for some ideas . The experiments , and our results:1 . Telegraph . This BARELY worked . By that , the paper clip telegraph clicker ( which was supposed to 'tap ' the head of a nail ) hardly moved at all . No clicking , just a slight movement.2 . Light Flashing Generator . This appeared to be the easiest invention , and the one my son was most excited about . However , I was provided an incorrect part as the light bulb holder displayed in the instructions looked NOTHING like the one in the box , and there was **no way** to transfer electricity to it . Thus this did not work at all.3 . Radio . As with all the `` inventions '' I followed the instructions to a tee . We spent close to an hour putting this together exactly per the instructions , and of course it did not work . Then again , I really did not think we would make a radio out of toilet paper rolls and alumninum foil.4 . Motor . This one we actually got to work , and it was very cool . Of course we had to deviate quite a bit from the instructions to get it to work.The instructions are sorely lacking . It is mainly pictures with instructions that state , `` Build the telegraph like this '' pointing to the fully built telegraph ( as an example ) .If you are looking to purchase some science experiments for your child , I would not recommend this at all . Instead I would go with the Mythbusters series , which actually work .	-1
Some people get this game and some do n't . I get it and still do n't like it very much . It 's just way too random to ever be able to plan or carry out any kind of strategy over multiple turns . Having too many rules down at once causes turns to take forever , as you will have to stand up over the table and scan every card on the table in order to make a decision . If you & # 34 ; get & # 34 ; the game then you will have fun for a few hours , then quickly get bored with the limited effect that skill and planning have on your chances of winning .	-1
I can not get anyone to play this with me after the first play . I was n't that enthralled with it but I do know that sometimes it takes a few plays to really get `` into '' a game so I am disappointed that I ca n't do that . There are only 3 of us here , a 26 y.o . and his parents so I think maybe that 's the problem . Also , the whole outcome of the game is dependent on luck and I think we like games that involve a little strategy as well as luck . It is probably more fun with more people and some kids thrown in the mix . Lots of reading necessary for this one though so not too young .	-1
We 've only played a few times , but so far we have n't found this card game lives up to the other reviews . There are basically 3 types of cards : goal , action and keeper/creeper . Goals can ( possibly ) change from one player to the next , so you do n't plan ahead . Actions can take several minutes to play depending on what they are , so even with 4 playing , it may be 5-7 minutes before your turn comes around again , so has n't held our interest .	-1
I bought this for my verbal eight year old based on the reviews . We have had it one year now and have played it 3 or 4 times . For us , the negatives are : 1 ) you are essentially playing alone , building your own crossword without even needing to know what the other person is doing . The only time you pay attention to them is when they take a tile and you have to take one too . 2 ) the child ( at least mine ) sometimes needs help fitting in awkward letters or reconfiguring her board , but she 's on her own in this game . Handicapping the adults by having them pull more tiles does n't even this out so overt help is needed , which makes it less fun . 3 ) the child is not learning any new words since they do n't need to pay any attention to any board other than their own , so the educational value is less.If you are like us and think the above negatives are deal-breakers , then I would recommend the game Catch-Phrase which is interactive , educational , fast-paced , and kids can play even with adults if you let them skip phrases they do n't recognize . ( They still learn the phrases when they hear them defined on other people 's turns . ) We have the card , rather than electronic version . It 's a blast . Kids over on playdates always drag it out , and when we have family over everyone wants to play . This has never happened with Bananagrams .	-1
The organs felt gross as promised , but the workmanship ( or work-machine-ship ) was so shoddy that we immediately whisked it away from the 4-year-old and sent it back . Luckily , he 's forgotten all about it .	-1
The organs and bones snap in to hold them in place , problem is it does n't stay . its such a tight fit , one part snaps in causing a chain reaction of other parts popping out . With these distractions the teaching focus is lost and quickly becomes more a puzzle project than a teaching opportunity ; net-net , not a good teaching tool . Its also much smaller than I thought it would be . We returned it .	-1
Purchased this for our 6 year old . tried to play it once . the instructions were too difficult to understand and play . getting rid of it today .	-1
NOT SUCH A FUN GAME , UNLESS WE JUST DO N'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY , BUT SO FAR , WITH ABOUT 3 VERSIONS THAT WE HAVE TRIED , IT IS N'T ALL THAT GREAT .	-1
This came with only the tiles . No instructions and we still have not figured out a way to print instructions from Mindware 's site . There is also supposed to be a bag -- this was missing , too .	-1
Had a family night with this one ... Pros : Lots of InstructionsShort and Longer gameplay on gameboardCons : ConfusingHave not heard of many of the filmsBoring and Loses interest because most of the stuff has never been seen before even though we watch tons of movies and tvShort review but I say pass on this one !	-1
We had a big family game night last week and I broke out the new Scene It Comedy edition . It featured written instructions as well as instructions given on the DVD which was included . The game board can also be expanded for longer games . About 10 of us played the game and most of us were confused by the questions . I have never heard of a lot of the movies that were included . All in all , unless you are a complete comedy movie buff , I do not recommend . I have played other Scene It Games in the past and enjoyed them - I think I just was n't into the Comedy Movies that were included .	-1
Right before I played Scene It Magical Moments for the first time , I played a round of a 2nd edition Disney Scene It that I already owned . That was great fun . Sadly , the new Magical Moments edition is just not very good.The presentation is pretty abysmal in comparison to other games . The Second Edition board had pictures of characters on each space . It was rather attactive . Magical Moments on the other hand simply has blank spaces and a few random ( and they are quite random ) characters thrown on the board . Also gone are the double move spaces , which is sort of inexplicable . The Buzz cards are now retangular instead of circular and do n't fit as nicely on the board . Obviously , they went out of their way to make some changes , I just ca n't figure out why . Also , one of the playable characters is the hero from the upcoming Disney movie `` Tangled . '' Seriously ? No Mickey Mouse , Donald Duck or any of those classic characters but we get Rapunzel ? This game of Scene It plays pretty much like any other game of Scene It . You roll , you move , you answer a question on the DVD or cards and if you get it right , you move again . Unfortunately , the first roller had moved three quarters of the way around the board before getting a question wrong . And that was only because that person lost an `` all play '' which is really the only way to end a turn in this new game . They also added a new DVD category called `` my puzzle '' which allows you to use the DVD remote to pick an answer . These are also too easy.The clips remain amusing , but the questions are just too easy for your average Disney fan . Since I assume only Disney fans would pick up a game like this , it seems rather hopeless that people will have a lot of fun . So my recommendation would be to go purchase Scene It Disney Second Edition , which really is a run and often challenging game .	-1
If you 're an obsessive fan of all the new B effort motion pictures and direct-to-video sequels being pumped out by the Disney studio , then you 're likely to be very pleased with this game , which seems to give a lot more attention to Bolt and the newest Winnie the Pooh cash-in than the classic masterpieces that made Disney a household name in the first place . Few and far between are My Play and All Play questions relating to the classics , instead utilizing the game as a sort of advertisement for all the garbage that is n't already in your video collection.Add to this a thoroughly lackluster presentation ( at least the disk loads faster because there are n't any impressive sounds , images , and effects to cue ) , and I give Disney a C-/D+ for their efforts here . It works , and some families are going to enjoy it , but those of us who think of Snow White and Beauty and the Beast when we hear the name `` Disney '' are n't going to have much use for this game .	-1
DVD games are a real mixed bunch . Sometimes they are good , sometimes they are bad . But when they are bad , they tend to be horrible . My kids really enjoy the little mini-games the come as extras on some movie DVDs , so I thought I would give this game a shot . While it is not the worst game I 've ever played , it ranks pretty close.The pacing of this game is just too slow . I got bored , my kids got bored , and in the end we just pushed on to say that we finished . I do n't think we even got excited about a winner . Do n't get me wrong , I think that if the family sat down to do this as a Christmas chat type activity , it would be better . We just sat down to play it ( we were too busy to play during the holidays ) and there just was n't any magic . I think that a game should be fun no matter when you play it , so I am not taking the `` Christmas Magic '' into account in my rating.Overall : If you need a family activity for Christmas time , you could do worse than this . Just do not think that this is a game that you will get out often ( or even every Christmas ) . As with most DVD games , replay value is very limited .	-1
I was trying to find a kind of fantasy game to play with my 6 year old son and this was a fail . It was confusing and boring . The goals are just having certain cards . Too many cards for my son to keep track of and the play was really boring . I will try the Dungeon board game next , that 's probably more like what I was looking for .	-1
There 's no strategy to this game . The conditions of victory are constantly changing so there 's no way to know who is close to winning . Someone just wins out of nowhere . It 's basically the same as rolling dice to see who wins . It 's incredibly boring and I 'm perplexed that people rate it so highly .	-1
The idea is great , but the numbers are so small a child has trouble seeing what color to use . The finished products are good , but getting there is tough for youngsters .	-1
a simulater replicates what the real thing is ever used a rc controller ? well throttel is on the left pitch yaw , elevator.. on right.. right ? well to tally reveresed on this .. so im trying build ..instincts on the sticks .. well learn on this when you got 200 or more on a model , crash your cash its backwards ! ! ! i have flown real airplanes have 83 hrs solo . this would kill you in the real world.. now sims are awesome this will waste your model.. because ... the inputs on this.. mirror revers from spektrum.. futuba.. nice game though ... lol forget this # $ % ok get a real one.. ok ?	-1
First , mine arrived DOA but it was obvious that this is a toy and not really appropriate for proper training in radio control operation . It 's too small , does n't have trim control and the sticks have none of the feel that an actual controller does . I did n't get to test its accuracy since it was defective but even if it was spot on , there are much better options out there - check out the Dynam 6ch controller - it is life size , has trim control , good feel on the sticks and works well with Clearview SE ( free ) . Do n't even bother to download FSM , it is outdated , no longer supported and not all that good when it works . The upgrade of Clearview is only $ 35 to get all the models and airfields or buy them one at a time to add to the freeware version.Props to Amazon as they immediately issued a return label and promptly credited me back my funds . Notice this is sold by a 3rd party vendor but fulfilled by Amazon - that makes all the difference in the world since the seller has to comply with Amazon 's policies .	-1
Do n't click buy . Quality is not there , does n't hold up well . Broke after a few uses . Would not recommend to anyone .	-1
Great and fun ... .for about two weeks . Then the battery craps out and wont hold a charge anymore . If only they made a better battery ... .	-1
This cheap little helicopter was pretty fun but did n't last.My 5 year old pretty much destroyed it . I know , not rated for a 5 year old but I only let him play with it after the tail rotor would n't spin.Figured how much damage could he do going up and down.Well , turns out quite a bit . Anyways its cheap.Its cheap , did I mention that ?	-1
Got it for Christmas and sadly it turned on for 2 minutes and never worked again . I have no idea why , but we never even got to fly it . Im not sure if my particular one was defective . Complete waste of $ 30.00	-1
A cheap but fun helicopter . It will not fly after several hours of use no matter what you do.I enjoyed three of them but bought a much larger and better one and it has many hours of flight time.Look for a better one and it is worth it . You can not use this outdoors at all .	-1
We purchased three of these helicopters and initially was very pleased . The helicopters are easy to control and very durable . Unfortunately , two out of the three seem to have significantly weakened batteries . They only fly for about 10 seconds before slowly falling to the ground even at maximum power . I 'm going to look for replacement batteries , but it is not designed to be replaced and will require soldering to get it to work .	-1
I just got word from my sis in law that the heli we sent my nephew for Christmas is a dud . How sad ... He really was looking fwd to this gift . The box seal was broken upon arrival and my sis said it looks like it might have been opened , but she would wrap it and give it to him anyways and turns out it doesnt even work . We purchased this from SVM but it was fulfilled through Amazon ( I recently just read some knock off Syma helicopters were being sold through here so I wonder if ours was one or if it was truly a dud ) and they have initiated a refund for us and sent out a new one already . So I give Amazon 5 stars for the effort ! I hope the new one works .	-1
I 've been through two of these little helicopters now and , while they 're fun , they 're really hard to maintain.I fly a couple of times a month . Not a lot , because I 'm busy , but I do have a good time flying . That infrequency plays a part in the problem , I think.First , the good part : This thing is really durable and super easy to fly . If you 've never flown an RC helicopter before , this is a good place to start . You can crash it and it wo n't break ; you can fly fairly erratically and it is easy to remain in control . That part is awesome.The part that is n't awesome is the `` no lift '' problem . If you go out and search for `` syma 107 no lift '' you 'll see tons of forums and articles talking about it . There 's even an Amazon discussion on this product about having no lift . For me , I think the problem stems from how difficult the battery is to maintain . It'sa tiny LiPo battery . LiPo batteries are pretty notoriously finicky about how you use them in comparison to NiMH or other batteries you might see in larger units.My first helicopter was great for about six months , then I went to fly it and at full throttle the blades would spin but I 'd get no lift . I took the whole thing apart , lubricated everything , checked the motors and the gears , but no matter what I did - no lift . I boughta replacement batteryand installed it , then charged it up . That did n't last more than a week or so until I again hit the `` no lift '' issue . Bad battery ? Motor problem ? Who knows . I do n't have the equipment to measure battery voltages and discharge rates ... and for the price , I 'm not sure I should HAVE to.At that point I bought a second one of these , since they 're not too expensive . I figured , worst case , I could use the first one as spare parts for the second if I needed to . That was four months ago , and this morning I fired up the heli and got about 10 seconds of lift , then ... done . Spinning blades , down on the table , no lift.Some of the articles out there will tell you this magic formula : Wait five minutes after charging before you fly ; only fly for a max of five minutes ; wait five minutes after you 're done flying before charging . I could n't tell you if that works since I found it long after this second one died.If I have time , which I probably wo n't , I may try to combine the two choppers into one functional unit , maybe with ( yet another ) new battery . That said , with the relative prices of batteries to the actual helicopter , you buy three or four batteries and you 've almost bought a whole new helicopter.Anyway , take good care of your battery and your helicopter will probably last a long time . Mine ( both ) did n't , so this gets two stars overall . I give it one for durability since the physical copter is pretty durable but the batteries are apparently fragile like glass .	-1
I bought 4 of these and they are really easy to fly and a lot fun . The first problem you will discover is the extremely short flight time . The flight time is 5 to 10 minutes for a brand new copter . The second problem is it does n't take very long to damage them to the point where repairs are needed . If you do n't damage it then you will find out that the battery life dies of pretty quickly . You will find that after you have flown it for several days that the flight time is getting shorter and shorter.It is educational because you will can get a lot of experience in how to repair RC Helicopters with the S107G . This model is repairable and parts are readily available . It does take good dexterity , mechanical ability , and good eyesight or reading glasses . When the batteries go bad , which is frequently , you can unscrew the cowling , pull the battery , cut the wires , trim the wires that remain and cut and trim the wires on the replacement battery . Then you get to solder the wires together and insulate them with tape . Yes you got the idea , no plugable battery connections , just a PIA POS that you have to solder in place . It IS VERY educational.I recommend bypassing the education by getting one and sending it back after it breaks which is usually two weeks or less if you fly it every day . This is well within the return policy for Amazon . Hey you get what you pay for , and for less than $ 20 , that is exactly what get . Do n't get me wrong it is a lot of fun to fly and if you like to tinker it is a WHOLE lot more fun .	-1
I purchased this as a gift for some friends ' son . I was embarrassed to find out the helicopter did not work when the birthday recipient opened it up . Luckily , Amazon accepted my return .	-1
First disappointment from Syma ... I have never gotten a bad product from them until now . This heli looks good , really good , but does n't have the power to lift off . It gets about a foot off the ground then drops like the battery is dead . It 's a shame , it looks really cool . I have 7 of their other ones . I would recommend any of their other products .	-1
I 'm really disappointed in this . We got it for our son and after one adult driven test drive to see how the controls worked ( with no major crashes ... a few wall bumps and one ceiling touch , by far nothing hard enough to visibly damage it ) and it would not lift off again after that . No visible damage , no gears stripped , full charge ... all it would do after the first 2 minute flight was spin on the ground . It 's repackaged and on it 's way back to Amazon as I type . Save your money .	-1
They must really be cranking these babies out as this one was missing one of the 4 main rotors ! ! ! I used a rotor from one of my older scrapped choppers and it will fly but this bird does not fly well at all . I have probably owned 20+ of these Syma type choppers and as they get older they typically do two things.1 . The battery life gets shorter and shorter.2 . They become harder to control in that they start doing sort of an oscillating motion if you arent in hard forward flight.This particular unit is doing the oscillating from the get go . Am sending this puppy back !	-1
I purchased this charger in January 2013 based on the good reviews . Unfortunately , I purchased ( new ) it from a vendor at a swap meet . It has always had a few quirks . Today , it gave me the infamous & # 34 ; SHORT ERR & # 34 ; message while charging at the club field . Now , I have no way of putting my lipos on storage charge until I buy a new charger . I 've tried different charging leads , charging from 110 and 12V car battery , etc . I would not recommend this charger .	-1
Out of the box one prop starts turning as soon as you plug in the battery . When you let go it starts going round and round inside the cage . Tried to fly it but totally uncontrollable so ordered a new one and will try again .	-1
The left stick , on the transmitter , controls power and left and right turns . The right hand stick , controls forward/reverse and left/right bank . This setup is most annoying . The transmitter antenna is a prop , so do n't expect outdoor type range . This is strictly an indoor toy.The quad copter cage definitely protects the props , but , it will soon become annoying . It rolls around constantly and hinders control even more.After 2 days , the electronic gyros went bad and it became impossible to fly .	-1
This is my 2nd H911 that I have returned . The first one because one ofthe batteries stopped charging after a few days and the batteries keptpopping out on crashes . Batteries in this one fits nice and snug.I am returning this one because the body and tail boom vibrates and shakesmaking for less than smooth flight.I will be trying a 3rd and 4th one.Just ordered the replacement for this one and a red/white BNF V911.It is a nice flying helicopter if you can get one w/o problems.2-3-2014 Received my replacement order for this H911 . The replacement is worse . The body and tail boom still vibrates . Now one of the 2 batteries connectors is crooked and requires some doing to get into the helicopter.I am down grading to 2 stars because of the vibration and battery not connecting well . I will not purchase anymore 911s . Quality control leaves something to be desired . Returning this one also .	-1
The game concept is good , and I 'd heard it was very fun , but this version is made on the cheap . Extremely lightweight and flimsy , the base does n't feel like it would survive an accidental drop . I might get an older copy that is more substantial , but I do not recommend this game .	-1
I had Mastermind as a child and loved it . For our wedding , we registered for this - the new version.The box is CHEAP - it will fall apart very easily . It is also way too big for what is included inside.The plastic board is also cheap , and the wall between the two types of pegs does not keep the pegs from mixing , so you end up picking the different pegs out of the other slot - time consuming ! Plus , the trays are so poorly constructed that it is almost impossible to close the lid without getting pegs stuck so that it ca n't close.They should have just used the same construction as the old sets , and they 'd have been much better off .	-1
My one complaint is the lack of spaces between the gamers.Everything else is quite nice for non active kids of this day , and age . Though I would recommend an open area to play . The bigger the better , and soft for falls.Carpets verse hardwood or title floors . If , playing , outside keep mat on a level surface . Avoid locations with tripping hazards , or little room to move .	-1
Small little set not what I expected . Found a much nicer larger set at one of the big dollar chains . A waste and not a good gift . Looks cheap	-1
I 'm not sure how these blocks got any positive reviews . Most important to me ... all the blocks with the pic of an elephant are misspelled and read `` elerhant '' . The pictures over all are not great . The grapes look like cherries ... have you ever seen candy apple red grapes ? The apples look like red pumpkins . Some of the blocks have pictures but the corresponding letter has been replaced by a symbol and other letters ... confusing to a child trying to learn . Additionally , the quality of these blocks is not great as the paint was already scratched off on a few when they arrived and the wood is frayed on some . They have a strong odor ( kind of like clay ) . Lastly , they are quite small as others warned although the size is clearly written in the description . I expect to see a set like this at a dollar store and would not recommend .	-1
It just wasnt fun . It didnt come with enough pieces for the price they were asking but we tried it anyway ... along with magnalinks..Magnalinks won us over in comparioson . I really dont even know what happened to theses gears..they were hard to snapped together my 3 year old and 4 year old and even my 8 year old had no interest in them.If you like this kind of stuff i recommend the magnalinks !	-1
I got this toy after reading reviews of other parents and thinking my 5 year old son would enjoy it . He loves to build and put things together , but this does not hold his interest what so ever . He put 2 of the wheels on and snapped the base together and has not touched it since . The biggest problem I have with this is that it smells like it was stored in a musty/moldy warehouse . The box can be smelled from several feet away and it is not pleasant . It kind of makes me feel like the whole thing is dirty .	-1
I have a 3 1/2 year old son who LOVES to build things . He loves toys that move , and he loves toys that constantly change . When I saw this product , I thought for sure I had a jackpot winner . We had a Groupon , which brought the price down to $ 5 . Had we paid any more than that , we would be a lot more unhappy than we are . $ 5 is even too much , I think.The cheap plastic green base is REALLY hard to put together . Tonight , my husband was attempting to snap the pieces together , and it sliced his thumb , and sliced another finger bad enough that he was bleeding pretty heavily . The connectors & pillars are also REALLY difficult to use . You have to push them really hard to get them on & then when you try to remove them , it 's very difficult . Maybe an older child would be able to , but my toddler ca n't use this toy by himself.We 've had this toy for under a week , and it 's held his interest for maybe five minutes of playtime . Will be donating this to the Goodwill .	-1
We bought this for our 3 year old daughter after reading the positive reviews . Sadly , within a few hours of having this cash register , the drawer would not stay closed . We try to close it , and it latches for a couple of seconds , then springs open on its own . If we had been more proactive , we would have returned this for another brand .	-1
My son loved this toy , but we returned it as the digital display never functioned properly and displayed only gibberish rather than numbers . Sure , I got my money back , but did not appreciate the hassle . Also , the drawer opens so forcefully that money flies out every time ... my son needs no help making messes . Looking at other brands as I 'm very hesitant to buy this product again .	-1
It was cheap- the quality the look . I did n't like it and sent it back right away . It was n't what I was imagining to complete the grocery store I wanted for them .	-1
We love the book in our house so I assumed this would be a GREAT game for the kids . We have played it twice and the second time I could tell the kids were not interested in playing . Pretty boring and disappointing for the $ 18 or so I paid for it .	-1
Best Age : 3Pros : In theory , the game would teach a toddler to wait his/her turn , how to match colors to move along the path , and then the important life lesson about winning/losing and still having fun.Cons : The entire re-design . Totally ridiculous . Do n't waste your money . Go to eBay and get the real thing.As everyone else has probably explained , the original characters from the 80 's are gone . This alone would n't invoke such an awful rating . The problem is they were replaced with extremely intense pictures which are so detailed and huge , that the path has been narrowed and now winds through some new places ( so it is longer and thinner ) . To be honest , I even missed the secret path when I landed on it because the game board is so busy , you ca n't really see where it starts . The enlarged gingerbread men ( and I thought the Katy Perry video totally mocked them , uh yeah - they are fairly accurate in terms of these new creepy ones ) do n't even fit on the micro-spaces that comprise the path . Because the path winds around itself so many times , it is hard to follow , knock your guy an inch and suddenly you are in the next loop of the path and have jumped ahead dramatically . It now takes about double the time to play a game , in part because the path is much longer - but also because the board is harder to follow . It seems it was designed with a deranged teenage girl in mind , not three year olds . You would think they would test these products and do a side-by-side with kids comparing the new one to the old one - hands down , the original would have won.Unfortunately , this is pretty much the only board game for 3 year olds and now it is rendered useless . By the time your child has the dexterity to move his/her piece along this narrow , windy path without being distracted by all the crazy graphics - he or she will realize how babyish this game is and will have moved along to something more challenging.I did actually write to Hasboro directly regarding the above issues , though I doubt they will ever respond .	-1
I had fond memories of playing this game growing up , so I was excited when my kids received it for Christmas . After opening the game , however , I 'm not so excited . They have changed the board from the classic version ; it is much more visually cluttered and Princess Lollypop and Queen Frostine look like Bratz dolls , which I 'm not happy about.. Also , after playing the game as an adult , I realized that it requires no skill whatsoever and is completely a game of chance . Not super educational . I 'll probably end up donating it to the thrift store .	-1
Many adults do n't like playing board games . Why ? Because they think that all board games are more-or-less nothing more than sophisticated versions of Candyland - games which rely on nothing more complicated than random chance.The fact is that random chance does n't make a very interesting game for adults ( unless you 're making bets , I suppose ) , and it does n't make a very interesting game for children either if they 're used to games with more strategy involved . ( My young nieces , for example , *will* ask a lot for Candyland - but only because I am not willing to play it with them very often . ) Some people think that the lack of strategy makes these games easy for young children , and that 's probably true , but it also makes it frustrating for them - they hit a losing streak and they have *no way* to turn it around , and they know that . I have never seen the same frustration with losing in games like Sleeping Queens or Crazy Eights that I have in Candyland - and , tellingly , when my older niece loses Crazy Eights she pouts and then asks to play again . When she loses Candyland , she pouts and puts the game away ! Some chance is good in a game for kids - it levels the game . But I do not think a game that is entirely based on luck is a good idea.Instead of Candyland , I 'd reccommend a game with some level of skill involved - Memory , or Froggy Boogie , perhaps.There is no reason you and your kids have to be resigned to games of capricious fate.Edit : I 've found out why my niece likes this game at all . It 's not for any aspect of the game itself - it 's because when she loses or wins due to chance , we have her `` draw a bedroom '' for herself , or for us . We started doing it because she got too frustrated and upset at losing through no fault of her own .	-1
There are three items* SOMEONE should warn parents about before they buy them . This is one of them . I only wish someone had told ME years ago ... Yes , this game is cute and easy to play . Yes , it 's famous . And yes , it 's probably educational.But be warned - it is THE most boring game in the universe . After ten minutes you will find yourself in a stupor . You 'll look at the board and begin trying to calculate how much time it will take for the game to END . Soon you 'll feel the urge to throw your chair through the window ... not the loving-family-ambience you were expecting.AND EVERY TIME YOU THINK THE GAME IS JUST ABOUT OVER , YOUR KID FALLS DOWN A CHUTE AND HAS TO START OVER ALMOST AT THE BEGINNING . You will find yourself lying to your children , telling them a `` 2 '' means `` Move 4 '' , and secretly scribbling over the chutes at midnight with a fat-tipped indelible black marker while spouting gibberish and drooling.Let your kids play this at pre-school . Give it to the grandparents . JUST DO NOT ALLOW THIS GAME IN YOUR HOUSE IF YOU VALUE YOUR SANITY . *the other two are Candy Land and the book `` The Little Engine That Could ''	-1
I just played this game with my oldest son who is 6 . I felt like we had fallen into in infinite time loop anomaly , and a boring one at that.Where to start ? First , there 's the cheesy cardboard gender specific pieces , and if you have a combination of genders not supported by the pieces , tough . Why not just do something colorful and abstract like other games . Add to that the cardboard stand-up pieces are too tall and continually falling over and getting in the way when opponents are continualy passing each other and landing on the same squares as they are continually reaching for that magic 100 and getting sent down a slide to oblivion only to begin the process again.Then there 's the infinite and tedious gameplay . Move in straight lines back and forth on a mostly featureless board counting up to 100 as you spin a spinner and hope against hope that you get to climb a ladder and avoide a `` chute '' ( which is actually a slide ) .I suppose it 's great if you want to teach a child to count to 100 and keep playing at reaching a goal no matter how much bad luck befalls him or her , but Candyland can do that ( well , not the 100 part but the goal part , and the kids do n't need to know how to count to 100 ) and it 's a lot more fun.The other adults ( my wife and a friend ) that I mention this game to both remember playing it as a child and changing the rules just so the game will finally end . So , what 's the point in this game ? Seriously , this game might have been great in its day , whenever that was , but you 've got a lot more options now . Those kids do n't stay little and cute forever , so why not buy a geniunely fun game to play with them ?	-1
I do n't understand why , but this game has changed since I was a kid . The concept and game play is the same , but the board is terribly laid out . My young children can not figure out which direction to go , and frankly , I have to look very carefully in order to help her . The game takes a long time to play , and often we get confused about direction and such , because the board is so busy and cluttered . I think Chutes and Ladders could use another revamp . I wish it was easier to play , like the version I remember from my own childhood .	-1
I bought this for my son as a first game , and I 've played it with him , as well as his younger sister , who is now 4 years old . I cringe every time they want to play this game . The board is so busy looking , and the slides cover squares that you need to count as you land on or pass by . It 's confusing to kids about which way they 're to go on the board ( first they go left , then they go up , then they go right , etc . ) I constantly have to help them count squares that are covered over by the slides , et al , tell them which direction to go , etc . This is not one of the best counting games out there . Try Hi Ho Cherry-O . MUCH better game !	-1
I know this is a `` classic '' but in this version my almost 5 year old son ( and myself actually ) have trouble following the track . You move from left to right and then when you get to the end of the row you move up one space and then move right to left then on the next row you do the opposite again . The spaces are numbered but it is hard to read and my son obviously can not follow the higher numbers . So you end up going one way and then you slide down and you have to go the other way . It is frustrating for us because we end up getting confused and having to redo the turn because we went the wrong way.The `` water color '' pictures are nice but it is sometimes hard to tell where you are supposed to be.Candyland is much clearer in this sense and my son has a lot of fun with that one .	-1
To many rules to much crap to keep track of , not for children at all . Children just give up and walk off .	-1
The game is kinda fun and my son loves it , but it 's so cheaply built and over priced ! The plastic breaks too easily , nothing sits right and the slightest bump knocks everything out of place . If your kids are n't asking for it , get them something else !	-1
I always enjoyed playing Mousetrap as a kid . The game setup is the same , but the pieces and mechanisms are very flimsy , cheap , and low quality . Parts do not fit on the board very well and the mechanism broke after just a couple of times setting it up . This game is a great example of a company totally sacrificing quality for the bottom line . A once fun game now compromised .	-1
Bought his for my son for xmas . We were disappointed that the game has changed since I was little . Now you build the board as you play the game . As a result we do n't actually play the game . We set the board up and make up our own game .	-1
Well , make sure you open it up right away to ensure it has all the pieces ! Unfortunately our set arrived missing the red bath tub , rendering the entire game useless , and my return window with Amazon has passed . A game like this can not be properly played without every . single . piece . ! ! Fail . We really wanted to & # 34 ; relive childhood & # 34 ; with this game , but I do n't want to order another set since that could be missing its bath tub too ! Way too much hassle for what is apparently a mediocre game based on current reviews , and precious money wasted when the marketplace is filled with honest to God great games . Pass on this one , citizens .	-1
I give this game two stars because my 5 year old son always pulls it out to want to play with it . The game itself is not worth playing , but the construction part can be fun.However , the game pieces are so poorly and cheaply made that I do n't think it is worth anyone 's time to play with it . Not only do the parts NOT fit , but the thin plastic pieces bend and break very easily . My husband got this game because he played with it as a kid , but this particular set does NOT offer the same kind of fun as the old set .	-1
I HATE THIS TOY ! ! ! IT LOOKS SO MUCH FUN BUT HTEN , ONCE YOU BUY IT , IT BREAKS ! ! ! THE TRAPS ARE BROKEN AND THE BOARD GOT SCRATCHED ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I HATE THIS TOY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! DO NOT BUY IT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
The pieces are way too small and way too hard to get out of the spaces without making the buzzer go off . My 6 year old does n't find anything fun at all about this game . The pieces get stuck under the game board and are almost impossible to get out . Save your money for something else .	-1
Perhaps it was the nostalgia , perhaps the clever packaging . Whatever compelled me to buy this game , I hope you do not fall prey to the same misguided intention.My kids hate the game . They hate the buzzer , and they hate the tiny parts that get lost in the carpet . They hate the premise . There is no educational value in this game other than learning to count money or learning that specialists get paid exorbitant amounts of money , even more than & quot ; regular & quot ; doctors.Within minutes after we installed the batteries , the red light bulb that serves as a nose no longer worked.I recommend you spend your money and time elsewhere .	-1
We purchased this game for our granddaughter because our kids had it as children and spent hours of giggly fun operating on Sam . We were so very disappointed with the quality of the game . It sure is n't what it used to be . The plastic `` organs '' and `` bones '' slip right off the tweezers when you try to remove them during the `` surgery '' . They could have at least produced some kind of grip edge on them . Also , the tweezers actually throw sparks when they touch the sides of the `` operative sites '' . Coupled with the loud buzz , our granddaughter perceived the was going to be shocked or hurt . Even though we explained that she would n't be . She said , `` I do n't like this game . '' The game board itself is also very cheaply constructed . It 's really a shame that they 've ruined a game that was loads of fun in cutting costs by cheap manufacturing . Sadly , this is another product manufactured outside the USA and it 's become junk !	-1
I wish I had bothered to read the reviews before ordering this game . Paid $ 40 to get the & # 34 ; original & # 34 ; version of this game and instead got the so called updated version which has large holes and rubbish items to take out and that 's it.Applied to return it but could n't without talking to customer service . After explaining the problem she said she would issue a return slip and send the game I had ordered , which by then had gone up an incredible $ 20 to $ 60 . She did agree though I should have it at the original price I ordered it for and was going to issue a $ 20 credit to my account.I presumed the matter was sorted until two days after when I received the exact same game from Amazon . I again could not return the game without talking to customer service but was unable to explain anything more than I wanted to return the game . The fact I still wanted to order the original game did not sink in with the cs agent . The agent merely commiserated with me when I said I still wanted the game and could I get it through Amazon or not as so far it did n't seem likely . The & # 34 ; I understand how you feel & # 34 ; comment I got made me decide to give up , particularly when , as I was chatting with the cs agent I noted that in the last two days the price again had risen by another $ 10.I 've now bought it through Ebay , at least I hope I have . It 's a shame as I never had an unpleasant experience with Amazon before .	-1
We purchased this as part of our classic Christmas - it 's very cheaply put together . The bubble pops , the pieces fit in their slot ... but it 's flimsy ; even the box it is stored in is flimsy and not like other board game boxes.Would not buy another - rather look for a vintage/ better made one .	-1
I bought the 'newer & # 34 ; Trouble and was disgusted by how flimsy and cheaply it was made -- nothing like the one I had as a kid , which is the one pictured in this product ad . This one claimed to be the & # 34 ; classic & # 34 ; Trouble and was $ 20 more , so I bought it , thinking it was what it said it was . However , it is false advertising . I received the same crappy , flimsy , cheap new Trouble board game , where there is a piece of paper that goes over the plastic board peg holders . When you push the number bubble , all the pieces come flying off the board because it is THAT FLIMSY . So you are constantly fixing the pieces and trying to remember where you are in the game . I am returning it immediately . It is FALSELY ADVERTISED . It is NOT WHAT IS PICTURED OR DESCRIBED .	-1
This is what happens when a company decides that they can make much more money by re-making a very popular game as cheaply as possible ( made in china ) and then charging more for it . I ordered the game that is pictured and was willing to pay the $ 20 price tag because my grandkids have one and love it . What I received from School Specialty was & # 34 ; the new and improved & # 34 ; cheaply made version that sells at Walmart for $ 6 . Stay away from this Hasbro disaster .	-1
Make sure you verify which version you will receive before you place your order . I received the newer version of the game that is VERY CHEAPLY made . I searched to find the older one that 's pictured .	-1
After recently purchasing Sleeping Queens and LOVING it , adults and kids included , I started looking into other card-based games , which are perfect for travel . I bought this one based on reviews and because I thought perhaps my 4-year old daugther could easily join in as well , and hid it to be a surprise for a recent vacation.We played it once . It NEVER ends . Like literally , once you get down to two people , I can not see any way this game ever ends . And that sucks . Really , my daughter and I were the last two left , and ended up playing for 20 minutes after everyone else had left , eventually deciding to end and eat ice cream . Such a boring game in general , and it goes on and on and on.Get Sleeping Queens .	-1
I bought this game for my 7 year old son who is crazy for card games , but this was too much . It 's a little complicated at first but my 10 year old started to catch on to the rules and enjoyed it . I would n't recommend it for a child under the age of 9-10 .	-1
Does my 4 year old like it ? Yes . Which is why it gets two stars . The game goes on FOREVER ! I 'm not sure why there are not more complaints about this . The game could last 30 minutes , easily without some creative losing by an adult . I am all for a longer game , but that is not what I look for in a card game for kids . A strategy game , sure . This one is being hidden on the top shelf of the game closet .	-1
I bought this game because the box looked cute and it had won two awards . What a waste of money it was ! It is essentially a game of war - you scream and slam your hand on top of the pile if the cards happen to be flipped over in a certain combination ( two of the same next to each other ( `` a double decker '' ) or two of the same cards on either side of a different card ( `` a slamwich '' ) . There is absolutely no educational value to this game , it 's just a game that will have your kids yelling and arguing about who won a particular slam .	-1
Stratego was introduced in the United States in the early 1960s . Offering strategic elements of chess on a familiar board game motif , it became a very popular game in American households during the 1960s and 70s . By 2000 , no doubt caving to constant reports of how stupid American children were becoming , Hasbro changed the numbering system on the pieces , completely inverting the familiar 1-9 scale . Historically , the most powerful piece ( Marshall ) was marked `` 1 '' while the least powerful piece ( Scout ) was marked `` 9 . '' More recent editions contain pieces marked in the opposite manner , with higher ranked ( i.e. , stronger ) pieces displaying higher numbers . This decision was not met with universal applause , and in response ( or perhaps it was planned all along to generate multiple streams of revenue ? ) , Hasbro released a `` Vintage '' edition . So if you wish to own the same Stratego game you grew up playing , you are forced to find an older game or else purchase the more expensive Vintage edition . Another pitfall for would-be buyers is that Hasbro recently capitalized on the popular fantasy theme , releasing a version of Stratego which replaces the classic Napoleonic army with medieval themed pieces ( i.e. , dragon , dwarf , slayer ) . Confusingly , this version is NOT named Stratego -- the D & D ; Battle or Stratego -- the Fire and Ice Edition or any other moniker that might be helpful in distinguishing among them . Note also that this version also reduced the number of pieces from forty to thirty.To recap , there are three current Hasbro ( Milton Bradley ) offerings . They are all offered on Amazon ( at varying price levels ) and I will cross reference the manufacturer 's part numbers and also provide the relevant links to the games on Hasbro 's Web site , although you can not purchase directly there.====================================================Stratego NostalgiaHasbro Item # 40836 ( See Comments section below for link . ) The Vintage edition ( confusingly titled `` Nostalgia '' by Amazon ) offers the proper ( in my opinion ! ) numbering system , and comes in a keepsake wooden box.====================================================Stratego-Milton Bradley Board GamesHasbro Item # 04714 ( See Comments section below for link . ) The basic Stratego ( post-2000 ) edition offers the proper number of pieces ( 40 ) but the inverted ranking system . This last and most important point is not obvious until you scrutinize the Product Details . ( `` This new , updated version of Stratego is slightly different than the original , though the gameplay is the same . '' ) Plus you need to apply the stickers yourself ! Ouch , Hasbro cheaped out.====================================================StrategoHasbro Item # 45068 ( See Comments section below for link . ) The fantasy-themed version with 30 pieces . Again , Amazon has failed to adequately label the game , simply titling it `` Stratego . '' However the Product Features make it clear . ( `` Choose to lead warriors from an ancient arctic realm or a fierce army from a land of fiery molten lava . `` ) ====================================================Your best bet ? If you simply want the same game you grew up playing , just look for a cardboard boxed set from the 70s or 80s . For example , this version ( Stratego - The Classic Game of Battlefield Strategy 1986 Edition ) is the same one I have . I have owned it for many years with no complaints . Finding one for yourself , however , might be trickier than you think . Unless you buy it here from a Amazon Marketplace vendor -- which is not recommended , given the ridiculous prices -- you are left to your own devices to find it in a used game store or at a garage sale . Alternatively , you can buy one of the currently offered versions . But as I have demonstrated , they are not all the same as one another , and indeed very few are identical to what you may have grown up playing.P.S . After much further research , I believe either of these two sets ( Stratego Vintage Wood Book Edition ) or ( Library Stratego Game Set ) are equivalent to the Vintage edition described above , and at least one may be available inexpensively at Target .	-1
Half the reviews for this product are 5 star , half are 1 star . I decided to take the chance . I wanted something that would help me relearn my math facts and that would grow with my daughter as she begins to learn them . This sounded like the best one on the market and sadly , I still think that . So what 's wrong with it ? The numbers are not very dark so it is difficult to read it in both dim conditions and in bright light . Forget using it in a car.In addition , the numbers are poorly formed . They are similar to some calculators , where the numbers are made up of straight lines but that 's not the problem . The problem is that the lines have fairly large spaces between them which make the numbers oddly formed . When combined with how dim they are , it makes them quite difficult to read.The buttons barely work . You have to hit them firmly and check the display to make certain that your button hit was seen before moving on to the next number you want to enter . This is annoying for an adult but nearly impossible for a very young child to remember or accept . I also figured it was a matter of days before some of the buttons stopped working entirely.Another minor problem is the LED 's on the front are incredibly bright , actually painful to look at . A quick swipe of a black sharpie on the light itself would fix it but I figured there was no point . After trying it out for over a week , I sent it back . In case you are wondering , I ended up searching for an old DataMan - a similar toy from the 80 's .	-1
This toy is so expensive and yet so cheaply made . They break easily and do n't work well . For these steep prices ( $ 40 ) you can so much more for your money than this thing .	-1
I have many thinkfun game , and this is the least of my favor . It is too difficult even for an adult and answer key is not that easy to follow at all ! Not recommend !	-1
I bought 2 of these for my 2 kids for christmas ( 20 months and 3 1/2 ) my husband and i were really excited cause they were the big santa gift . We bought them plastic license plates with their names on them . We waited ti ; 2 nights before christmas to put these together because we did n't have a place to hide 2 of these . Good thing we did n't wait til christmas eve like we were planning ( i was paranoid they might be missing a piece ) Well , they were n't missing any pieces . the first one took my husband and i , ( together ) over an hour to put together . The instructions are the worst thing i 'd ever seen . There are NO words and you ca n't even understand the pictures ; They skip steps and expect you to know what to do . After we finally got through the first we were ready to tackle the second . Well , it was faster . 15 minutes in we were on like the second to last step , and two of the pieces would not fit together . We tried everything . Frustrated , I woke up at 6am christmas eve morn to go to walmart to exchange . Guess what , i had the exact same problem . Returned again , and they were out . Went to toysrus and the SAME THING . Okay now i 'm peeved . ( my husband had been from square one ) then finally got another and it worked . My daughter is actually almost too big for it ( ages go up to 5 ) shes 3 1/2 and small for her age . hers does n't get any use and my son will sit in it and turn the wheel , but not move his feet because they get stuck under his seat . i bought them the matching gas pump and my son loves to put gas in his and his sisters car , but still they never actually get 'driven . '	-1
I wish this game had more pieces . I bought it for my 3 year old son at Christmas and there are n't very many pairs of puzzles . My son did n't even have to look very hard to find matches . The game does n't last us very long playing . He does n't learn anything from it which is a little disappointing .	-1
This concept is a great for little kids . Personally I think it is geared towards ages 2-4 yrs . Problem is , there are only so many pieces and it took my daughter 2 times to memorize the game . She was 3 and I found it too easy for her . She loves I Spy but this game is n't worth it . Get the momory game instead	-1
The top is brightly colored and was able to spin easily . However , the suction cup on the bottom did not work and was useless . After about 3 weeks of use , the handle broke and I was not able to repair the top . Yes the top did provide the stimulation it advertised but the durability of the product is greatly lacking .	-1
These bathtub fingerpaints colors are not nearly as vibrant as the two different bathtub crayons I also purchased and not nearly as much fun for my 20 month old . He loves to write on himself and the tub with the crayons but the paints are much too thin to really even see .	-1
The paints just do n't work . Do n't stay on the tub . Can not really draw with them . Disappointed in this bath time toy .	-1
This product is weakly colored bubble bath , not fingerpaint at all . My two year olds were very disappointed that when they tried to draw on the walls , they could n't see what they were drawing . They were confused and needed to dump out an entire bottle in their hand to spread on the wall in order to see anything . Then because it was all used up , they cried because there was n't any more . The palette is worthless because you ca n't hold enough `` paint '' in any of the fingers to be able to see anything when painted . The consistency is like bubble bath or shampoo , so in other words , runny and not a good material to use for painting . The kids could n't even make hand prints ! On the plus side , it did not stain my walls or grout . Not that I would expect it to ... because there is n't enough pigment !	-1
These paints are more soap than paint . When your fingers are wet the paints slide right off them , so it 's extremely difficult to a : get them on your fingers to begin with and b : apply them to any surface at all . They have barely any pigment and do n't stick to the side of the tub . Do n't waste your money .	-1
This paint set is meant to be used in the bath tub by a preschool aged child . It is completely useless unless the palette , the child 's hands , and the wall are COMPLETELY dry . If there is any wetness the paints are too runny to work . Who would expect a preschool child to go through such lengths to paint with a product that is SUPPOSED to be used in the BATHTUB ? ? ? It is like painting with water or disappearing ink.If you use a dry paintbrush on a dry surface with paint from a pallette being held by dry hands you get almost acceptable colors.Since I can not find the company 's website , I plan to write them a letter of complaint to the address on the box . What a waste of money .	-1
The original Rush Hour is still much more fun . The only reason I had to buy this is my son is such a train freak . The puzzles are not as challenging overall , yet the difficulty level is a bit uneven in the four categories ( junior , beginner , intermediate , advanced ) . Also , the build quality is poorer , as a few of the train pieces do n't sit properly on the board , and the colors on the train pieces do not match those printed on the puzzle cards , a sore point for a young boy .	-1
This thing is freaky . I bought one for my son and one night last week I woke up and it was on my nightstand and the crank was turning itself and then all of a sudden the clown popped up ! It scared the crap outta me . Avoid this at all costs .	-1
I bought this for my 1 year old , not really paying attention to the age suggestion . It is NOT appropriate for a one year old . My 3 and 5 year old love it and my 1 year old does enjoy watching it . It needs to have the song finish before Jack can go back down which is frustrating for kids until they understand what that means . I have seen some of the paint chip and the edges of the box have a few dents already . For the price everyone is listing it for , they 're ripping you off . For the price I paid ( $ 3.99 ) , it 's a good buy.EDIT : Ours died in late summer . It just stopped working . No music , no popping up . Nothing . I am so glad I did n't pay full price for this . Maybe we got a bum toy but as far as I 'm concerned , between the paint chipping and it breaking , it is pretty much a cheap toy . I would not recommend this product .	-1
I bought this for my daughter and she really liked the idea of it , but it never really worked very well . Often times , Jack would pop out the box without warning and getting him back in was always a hassle . The clip is supposed to hold him inside when the song ends , but it did n't alawys secure Jack in the box . Eventually , the clip broke and fell in the box and now Jack is permanently out the box . I contacted the manufacturer because I thought we may have rec 'd a defective model , but they ignored me . My daughter is not rough with her toys at all- she takes very good care of them , so I have to assume this is a cheap toy and a waste of money .	-1
Expensive and a little bit of a scam , with the mail in voucher for the caterpillars , PLUS $ 5 additional shipping charge . Do not recommend .	-1
The butterfly net was fine . But , it would of been better if we actually could get the butterflies ! The Insect Lore company is TERRIBLE with customer service ... absolutely horrible . I tried 5 times -- no joke ! -- to get the free caterpillars per the coupon that came in the butterly net package . And 5 times was told to leave a message for customer service -- no one ever called me back . And , 5 times was disappointed and left frustrated and angry that I could n't get anyone to filful my order . I originally ordered the caterpillars online but for some reason my order did n't go through right . So , I got a letter in the mail saying to call or mail in payment again . I wanted to call thinking it would be easiest that way and 5 times got nothing . My daughter was sad over this because she so badly wanted it . Oh , and at the final attempt , I asked the person on the phone who could n't help me AGAIN and advised that I leave ANOTHER message for customer service that Insect Lore did a big promotional campaign and because of that could n't handle all the calls coming in for ordering -- three words for Insert Lore : Not My Problem . If you say you sell something then sell it and treat your customers right because now , they lost me as a customer forever . So , buyer beware ... if you want those free caterpillars get ready for headaches . I finally gave up and returned the net .	-1
I must say I was very disappointed to receive this product only to find that the larvae do n't ship with the product ! If you go directly to the website insectlore.com you can buy gardens that ship with the larvae ... so you get it all at once . I 'm disappointed we have to pay an additional $ 5 now to get the larvae , and it will take an extra 3-7 business days ... UGH ! My daughter 's birthday is in 3 days , guess we 'll only be able to give her half of this present . Very very very disappointed . I wish I 'd just gone directly to insectlore and bought from them .	-1
There are lots of positivie reviews about this toy , which you can refer to hear all the good things this toy has to offer . Here are the I do n't like about it:1 . It 's makes noise that is appealing to children but very annoying to the adults in our family.2 . There is no place within the toy to store all the gears and pieces that come with it , so they end up easily separated and strewn around and lost easily.UPDATE : This toy lasted two and a half months before the motor that turns the gears broke and the toy stopped working for good .	-1
It takes up a lot of space , without being much fun.The rings break apart too easily , which frustrates the little kid . Plus , they do n't whistle easily ... also frustrating a little kid .	-1
We received this as a gift , and the idea sounded cute . HOWEVER , you have to wack the dolphins really hard to get them to make any noise . Also , the rings are nearly impossible for a 2-year-old to put together , and they fall apart almost immediately . We never use it in the bathtub ... it 's too frustrating and takes up quite a bit of room . My son did like it in his wading pool . But it 's basically just another floating toy .	-1
did n't stay linked in a ring , difficult to keep the appropriate amt of water in them to make them whistle . We tossed them .	-1
We were looking forward to this but it just does not deliver . The dolphins do n't make sound reliably and the darn rings will not stay hooked together . It is going into the Christmas return pile if I can find the box among the recyclables .	-1
I actually found these at home goods for [ ... ] ... well I am glad I did not pay more than [ ... ] ... First off the colors of the dolphins were all messed up..they did n't match their tubes ... When I mean they did n't match ... they put in whacky colors like red/orange colored dolphin but a yellow tube ( no yellow dolphin ) then we got two of the same colored dolphins . Okay..so the colors were n't a huge deal I suppose but then the dolphins would n't whistle ... that 's totally useless ... and as someone else mentioned the links do n't stay linked . HUGE disappointment !	-1
I swear by the reviews on Amazon.com , but unfortunately I did not read them before purchasing . Our 4th son just turned 1 , and celebrated his 2nd Christmas . I just bathed him and put the dolphins in with him ... .believe what you read . The rings do not stay together and the dolphins really do n't sing ! ! If you tap the tops of the head , nothing happens ; if you lift the dolphin out of the water and slightly & quot ; smack & quot ; the water with it , it will make a noise . Quite frankly it works better if you blow into the dolphin . The baby got a kick out of the toy for a short time . Maybe I 'll keep it just because he can dunk the dolphins and toss them around . Also , this toy takes up lots of room ! ! I gave it 4 stars for durability since it does seem pretty sturdy .	-1
There is a reason most of these reviews are one star this toy does n't even deserve 1 star all I can say is loved the ideal , did n't love the toy please save your money and PASS	-1
We got these for our daughter becasue she loves bath time and playing her toy piano . We figured this would be a cute toy that she would enjoy but we were wrong . You have to beat the poor dolphins to get them to play a note . And the note is more of an electronic sound ... it 's hard to describe it but it 's NOT a musical note ! And it never fails after fianlly beating the things enough to get a sound out of them the ring comes loose . It 's just a total pain to use . Granted she still plays with them in the tub just we could have bought a cheap bag of plastic dolphins at the aquarium and saves 3/4 of the money we spent on this set .	-1
This toy is supposed to be for babies and toddlers and yet it does n't have any of the features one would expect in a young child 's toy.One would expect color , ease of use , softness , and purpose . The only qualification that the Water Symphony Tub matches is that the dolphins and the rings are colorful.Which brings me to the question of who on earth thought that making the rings so hard to connect was a good idea . As a mom , I usually have other chores at bath time other than ring rangler . And then there is the hardness factor . The dashboard of my car is softer . A little more built-in teething satisfaction would have been nice.Two stars . The dolphins do make noise but not often enough . They are hard enough that a baby can hurt their gums on them , or *you* or a sibling if they are thrown . One plus is that they do n't seem to mildew .	-1
I was excited about the idea of a little toy for my 19-month old that made music in the tub . From the description of the toy , you 'd think that 's what this was . First of all , tapping the dolphins on the head makes either a ridiculous whistling noise that can barely be called a note , if it works at all . Most of the time , they do n't really work at all . And , as stated in other reviews , the ring does NOT stay together in the tub , making it hard to keep track of them and play any kind of `` song '' whatsoever . That being said , it 's a cute toy if you 're just looking for a brightly colored , floating tub toy , and for that purpose , my daughter likes it . Just do n't expect it to be much else .	-1
My son received this toy as a Christmas gift , and we were disappointed with it . Once out of the box , we were frustrated with the number of small parts , such as the tiny plastic balls which are used in the loader . These could be considered a choking hazard for younger children . Also , there is very little room for `` hands on '' play . The trains merely move around the track by themselves . My son became very frustrated with this and wanted to push the trains himself . I had to tell him that he would break it if he pushed them . I recommend that you purchase one of the excellent Thomas wooden train sets . They are much better than this set and allow for much more interactive play .	-1
My son received this as a gift and given that the toy wo n't stay together well or run right without adult guidance , he found the toy difficult and frustrating . He was interested at first in watching it but when he tried to play along , it would then fall apart and become a problem . The little balls are so easy to lose and though he loves the ball part of the toy , it is not safe for me to put in the play room since his baby sister will certainly swallow one . I think that is a hazard unless you have only one child in your family who is responsible ( or old enough ) not to put the balls into their mouth . Ifyou have younger children who share the play room , this is not a good toy to have around.I plan to ask the relatives who bought it to return it to the store .	-1
This toy was very dissapointing for my son who loves Thomas toys and the show . It is poorly made , do not mistake it for the other train sets of Thomas that you are used to . This is a cheaper version , and the wooden cars will not work with this track . I do not mind that it is plastic , what I do mind is that it does not work . It did not even last 1 hour with my son and I before it was completely unusable . The pieces were poorly made , do not fit together properly , and do not work . Keep looking for a better Thomas set .	-1
This is a great toy until you open the box and try to put it together . The tracks are difficult to put together and then stay together . They come apart when played with . It took me a long while to finally get the whole track together . Then a couple seconds into playing with it , it is apart again.I recommend if you want a Terrific train set get the GEOTRAX sets . They are easy durable and lots of fun to look and play with . Also anyone including your child can rearrange the tracks with easy . DON '' T GET THIS ONE > > > > > > > > > > >	-1
This was a completely frustrating and disappointing toy . Once Thomas , Percy and Terence have done their thing a couple of times , there is nothing else to see . Small parts like the `` coal '' marbles are dangerous in a house with a crawling baby and the box even says `` keep long hair away from moving parts '' ! ! Yikes ! ! Took forever to assemble , five minutes to watch , one minute to pack away . Do n't waste your money .	-1
Thomas and his friends , Percy and Terence , they load , fill , scoop , haul , and dump their cargo of `` rocks '' around this bustling construction site . The vehicles move backward or forward , it is automatic when your child chooses which area the engines will go to next . A chute that dumps the load of rocks into Percy 's tender and Terence will load Thomas with rocks.It was fun to look at for the first 30 mins but then my 30 months old son gets tired of it . There is no hands on interaction except controlling the loader to go forward or backward . I do n't think it is a good , stimulating toy for my son ! ! !	-1
Poor quality , not well balanced . Looked like the original gyroscope I still owned from years ago , however , after a couple of demonstrations to show the Grandkids , the soldered seam broke . Very disappointed . I would try another brand . It is a good teaching tool for the kids .	-1
really ? My son did n't care for . He played a bit and I thought he would keep playing but he has not touched since we got it and the only time he played . I think it should have some type of sound to catch kids attention and keep them interacting/entertained .	-1
I bought this for my oldest son because he is interested in learning addition and subtraction . He has only used it four or five times . He gets frustrated that his finger covers the answer and the plastic is so thick it is hard to read anyway . I remember using this toy when I was young and I thought the manufacturers would have developed a better product since materials have changed so much in the past twenty years .	-1
My mom bought this toy foor my son for Christmas last year ( 2010 ) . My son is just about 2 1/2 now . I wanted a jack in the box so that my son could work on his motor skills and oppositional skills . He loves being surprised too . For the 11 months that we have owned this toy my son still ca n't crank the handel . I myself find it kind of awkward to do so . The toy is cute and has n't broken ( yet ) . The star on the front turns and clicks . My 4 month old loves when I turn it . The button for the squeaker on the back is kind of hard to push ( for me ) . My two year old has n't tried playing with the button because it 's so hard to push ( he has other toys that squeak when you push them and he can do it just well ) .So , in conclusion , because the toy is so awkward and hard ( for a child ) to manipulate our toy has been not much more than space taking up my kids ' toy box .	-1
`` Jack '' does n't pop up after only a few weeks of owning it . Do n't waste your money .	-1
I was excited to find this toy because it uses the winding motion of a jack-in-the-box but is sized for little fingers . LIke all the Tolo toys we have , it is bright and colorful , but we seem to have gotten a defective unit . The little man pops up in the middle of the song ( & # 34 ; This Old Man & # 34 ; ) instead of at the end . Frustrating . I notice also that our 2yo has trouble pushing the little man back down -- he wo n't stay . I can do it , but it takes a delicate touch , something toddlers do NOT have . In addition , the squeaky button on the side is hard for little hands to push , and even in big hands it sometimes squeaks , sometimes not . If it worked right it might be good , but as it is we are disappointed , and ca n't recommend it .	-1
Altho I love the looks of this toy ( bright colors ) it is n't very engaging . For one , it takes too long to wind the toy to where the clown pops up . I think it 's a cute addition to my grandson 's toy box , but as far as entertaining him ... it does n't .	-1
I bought this thinking it would be great way to teach kids their multiplication but it is n't the case . When you press down on the buttons you can hardly see the answers . I remember them being a lot brighter . Very disappointed .	-1
The first day owning this toy my daughter suggested from the back seat that there was an error in the facts . Sure enough , the top left button , which should read 1x1 = 1 , in fact reads 1x2 = 1 . The button to its right does read correctly , 1x2 = 2 . My 8 year old caught the mistake . I 've posted pictures above to show you this error.As other reviewers have stated , the answers can be difficult to see . The translucent buttons are a little too opaque for easy reading . At least my children 's fingers are smaller than mine and they are able to move them out of the way to see the answer . Also , the fact is simply painted on top to rub off with repeated use . I also posted a picture to demonstrate the view of the answers.We 'll have to exchange this item for one of better quality .	-1
Bought this for my five yo who plays it in his class.The overall compostion of the game is so cheap . It is like it was made on a copy machine . The cards are paper thin , and will not last over time . After setting up the game , many of the cards were already bent.Next thing is that the directions are somewhat complicated . Maybe I 'm impatient , but I just did not get it.There are so many other games that are truly educational and that are well made . I 'm just not sure that this is one of them .	-1
We 've had the game for almost a year and we 've only played it when it arrived . Frankly , my 5 year old daughter and I did n't find it as much fun or as stimulating as expected based on the positive reviews . Main complaint is that the pieces are INCREDIBLY flimsy ( has a home made feel ) and one has to manage that aspect instead of fully focusing on the important things . My secondary complaint is that the game is barely more involved than the basic memory card games that cost much less and no where near as challenging as Zoombinis software , which we love . So , this game is not much fun , not well made , not very stimulating , yet it carries a relatively high price - avoid it !	-1
My family adores this game , and going by the many 4 and 5 star reviews many people do as well . It is basically rummy with a fifth suit and you play a whopping thirteen rounds with 3 cards for 3 to 13 for King . Your hand number each round doubles as that round 's wild card number in addition to the Jokers.That said , if you like strategy and resource management , you will never find them here . It is good for children but adults would do best starting on round 7 or so , because it is lots of arranging sets and runs until it is your turn to draw a card or grab an old one hoping the last player dropped a good card you need.I recommend any other game over this one , starting with Fluxx , which at least has rules changes to keep interest going .	-1
I played this game with my eight and nine year old kids . I am impressed how quickly they caught on to the complicated rules that change slightly every round of the game . Basically , there are 11 ( ! ! ) rounds in this game , and each round , another card is & # 34 ; wild & # 34 ; and each round the size of the hand increases by one card . You ca n't play this game without a pen , paper , and perhaps even a calculator at the end to tally up the scores.What annoyed me the most was the length of the game . Eleven rounds is veeeeeeeery long . And I paid $ 11-12 dollars for what is basically a deck of cards . They 're not like a deck of normal cards , because they have 5 suits and are missing the 1 's and 2 's but they are just paper and ink and some instructions . They should have been half that price . I ca n't really see my family playing it again , as I ca n't really include my younger kids and they wo n't be patient for the hour it will take us to finish this game .	-1
My family ( sister , mom , husband + me ) and I love Phase 10 . We 're avid card players and do well with complex games . Phase 10 is something we always carry with us on our holidays.Five Crowns is just not for us - its just not challenging enough . We got bored in a few rounds and went back to Phase 10 .	-1
I did n't realize this was so flimsy. , I thought it would be on a sturdy base . The pegs do not stay in place , therefore the shapes fall off as the pegs come out of othe holes in the base . I should have returned the item , but I did n't want to pay the return shipping and out littlel one plays with it as is . I do not like this toy ,	-1
My daughter is 18 months old and takes this toy apart every time she plays with it . She pulls the pegs out and puts them in her mouth . Then she tosses the shapes everywhere . Not exactly a sorter ! Just a mess . Save your money !	-1
The package did not mention that it was a choking hazard for children under 3 ! ! ! I plan to complain to the manufacturer . Its definitely a hazard if your child is still teething -- my 19 mo son who still likes to chew up stuff decimated a piece . I luckily fished out the red star in four pieces from his mouth before he could swallow and get into any trouble.So while I no longer give the toy to him , I plan to once he is over the chewing stage since he loved fitting the pegs back , and stacking and sorting and it definitely kept him educationally engaged . 3 stars on the durability since while he can chew it up , its an engaging toy , and my friends 3 yr olds enjoy the toy too . Also , Lauri replaces pieces for [ a nominal fee . ]	-1
We love `` SET '' and were excited to play `` Quiddler . `` We found the rules to be absurdly complex . We also found that playing by the rules was not much fun.Just to explain - Quiddler is just a deck of cards with letters and point values on them ( and they are beautifully illustrated ) - it 's a no brainer that you can just deal out cards and see who can make the most words , or the highest point words - it 's basically like a deck of Scrabble cards . And , the game is fun if you play this way.For us , the problem was trying to follow the written directions/rules included with the game - we found them to be absurdly complicated and really not that fun . We wound up just playing by our own rules . We enjoyed it mildly , but would probably rather play Bananagrams or Scrabble.This was only our first time playing so , if our opinion changes , I 'll update this review . For now though , it 's a weak 2 stars .	-1
The only interaction is that during your play/turn you get to chance to choose from the discard pile and only the card that the person before discarded . It 's also too easy to make words and go out , two rounds is the norm ; and the larger the word made means nothing extra . The high review average for this game says something about the people posting reviews in general .	-1
This is another that the kids all want when they see the commercial . It looks like it would be a blast . Do n't bother . It 's just not fun . It 's hard for kids to get the ice cubes in right & the little hammers are junk . With very little use , a couple of ours actually broke.I either put this away permanently or I threw it away . I ca n't remember which.This is junky garbage.Do n't buy this .	-1
I got this game cause I remembered playing it when I was younger and just loved it . So I got it for my kids . I put all the ice in and then realized it did n't come with the big block of ice for the bear to sit on . Still waiting for Hasbro to send us a big block.. otherwise whats the point in playing the game .	-1
I have a 3 year old and it can be difficult to find games that are n't too difficult for her but still fun for the rest of us . My kids , ages 6 and 3 , were totally excited to play this game as was I until we discovered that you spend more time putting the cubes into the frame than you do actually playing . It 's a real pain to put all the little ice blocks in the frame and honestly the last row of blocks is too difficult for the kids . Then , all the kids do is take turns hammering out cubes until the bear falls . My kids seem of pretty average intelligence and this game provided almost no challenge to them or even learning as far as I could tell . They both knew exactly when the bear would fall and that 's really only fun once or twice . I think we played it about four times in the past year . I hate to be down on any kind of game that brings the family together or gets kids involved in something away from the tv/computer , but this game is just annoying to set up and dull to play .	-1
This game fails to hold interest for my three and five year old girls.It 's a classic and they 're still excited to play when we bring it out , but they tire within two rounds , which only last about 30 seconds each . Left to their own , they would just like to pound all the ice cubes out as fast as possible , but since it takes a minute or so for an adult to setup , it 's not really fun for anyone . There 's never any surprise or challenge as to which cube will cause the bear to fall , so it basically feels like a complicated plastic tic-tac-toe game . On our set , the plastic is poorly finished , so the bear does n't stand/skate in the slot he 's meant to . Perhaps it 's better to wait till they are old enough for Operation or Kurplunk . For now , PopUp Pirate is the family favorite . If you have other suggestions , please leave a comment .	-1
My 9 year old , 6 year old and 4 year old played with this game twice and was bored . It 's very predictable . I thought as boys , they 'd enjoy hammering the & # 34 ; ice & # 34 ; . There 's not much physical or mental skill required .	-1
I bought this game after reading so many postive reviews.It is cheaply made and just no point to it unless you are a frustrated person who wants to hammer the same cube and make alot of noise.Wish I could understand why so many reviewers liked it so much.Someone enlighten me so I do n't feel I wasted the money .	-1
I love this toy , but I 'm not sure about my 9 month old daughter . She is still learning how to use it and is more interested in chewing on the pieces . She does like to watch me dump the pieces out and put them back in . I like it because it 's nice and simple and does not require batteries .	-1
There are much cuter shape sorters available that also may be more fun . I always had to coax my kids to play with this , its not all that appealing , but I like the choice of nine shapes and it is a good way for a child to learn those shapes . A good feature is the lid snaps shut which means pieces dont get lost in the toy box . Little ones will need help opening it though .	-1
If you look at the reviews on this toy , you 'll see that they skip 6 years between 2002 and 2008 ! ! What 's with that ? ? Just reading the first reviews before I ordered , I thought I was getting a shape sorter with 18 shapes ! Well those were the people that gave it 5 stars ... ... .back in 1999 . The latest positive reviews are mostly from people who ordered this and are excited because they 'll be getting the same toy for their grandchildren that they remember having years ago . ( in other words they had n't received it yet when reviewing ) Well this is n't that toy ! Playskool has cheapened it up BIG TIME . It only has 9 shapes now , amazon should really remove the reviews here that pertain to a totally different toy ! I would have never ordered it had I skipped back several pages in the reviews to find the truth ! Having the # 1 review be from 1999 is a little misleading ! ! Also the shapes are cheap and hollow with only the top being solid , and the bottom is & # 34 ; open & # 34 ; to the hollow interior . ( not shown in any pics , misleading again ) The entire thing is just cheap junk now with not enough shapes to make it stand out from other nicer shape sorters out there . Would NOT recommend this toy unless Playskool gets a clue and starts making the 18 shapes people are expecting .	-1
When my niece was younger ... about 10 years ago I bought her this toy , it was fun and included lots of shapes.I recently purchased this now for my 6m old and to my surprise it only has 9 shapes ! Holy cost reduction ! ! I liked this toy for the storage of all the pcs , they just stay inside and usually wont fall out.The color is kind of blah now too ... Look for other shape sorters that do the same thing but offer more pcs , you 're going to need them as they get lost VERY easily !	-1
I bought this for my son for [ $ ] knowing that playskool was a pretty good brand..I was wrong about this toy . The top comes off even if you barely touch it..so my son just puts them in the big opening..that dosent teach much..I wouldnt purchase it for anyone and I will look for a new shape sorter for my son .	-1
Please feel free to read this review in its entirety , or save yourself some time and avoid this version of Monopoly and buy the `` Monopoly - Classic '' version instead . While it is about double the price , it is the game you know and love . The less expensive version ( reviewed here ) is a piece of garbage.I regret this purchase . If you grew up playing Monopoly , you would be much , much better off buying `` classic '' or a used version . There are several major issues with this version , as well as some minor ones . If you buy this to teach your children one of the most beloved games of your childhood and a part of Americana , you are apt to be disappointed.The major issues involve quality and design . The board itself no longer folds in two . It is cut to fold into quarters and barely sits level on a table . I do not hold out much hope it will last very long . The property cards are flimsy , made smaller than in the past , as well as being thinner . The Chance and Community Chest cards are also of poor quality , much thinner than their predecessors , and take on color changes , now being blue/white and orange/white , instead of the familiar yellow and orange , respectively.The money is a big concern as well . The money is thin and there are not enough slots provided to use money in the bank during play , or to store after gameplay , and in fact there are raised areas in the plastic money tray which prevent the money from even sitting in the spaces . The raised areas are somewhat random and follow no logical pattern . So forget using the box/tray component for the bank during a game or storing money neatly . The tray is essentially useless . I have no idea what Hasbro/Parker Brothers was thinking here , and apparently neither did they.The minor issues are some game changes : The money is different color and handed out in different amounts . Very minor , yes , but now you have to get used to $ 10 being blue ( used to be the $ 50 ) as well as some other color changes . You are also starting the game with different amounts of money . Also the Income Tax space is now a flat $ 200 instead of `` 10 % or $ 200 '' , and Luxury Tax is $ 100 , no longer $ 75 . Again , these are minor but worth noting.I would avoid this cheaply made version . At the very least this should be advertised as what it is - `` revamped Monopoly . ''	-1
There is nothing worse than a game in which the winner is often obvious in the first 10 minutes but lasts another hour and fifty minutes . If your oppoent lands on premium spaces on his first two trips around the painfully monotonous board and you do not , well , you are screwed . Monopoly enthusiasts insist it is more than just rolling the dice ; important decisions are involved . Do you buy the property or not ? Well , let me help you with that : If you have the money ... then yes . There , decision made . I really do not see how marching your token around the same dull board in the same direction over and over and over again for what could be easily two or even more hours would qualify for anyone as fun . Some may say `` you just are n't patient . '' Balonie . Ive played many other games that have lasted for well over two hours . The difference is that those games have more interesting and varied decisions and planning to be done . You are not the victim of dice . ( Dice are not always bad . There ARE some games out there that utilize dice far better than Monopoly and do manage to tie the outcome of the dice to actual decisions in a more balanced way . ) But Monopoly just does not have anywhere near the mechanic needed to justify a game taking this long . I 've heard enthusiasts say it is a great way for kids to develop their math skills . Even that argument is weak because there are far better games out there that can help with those skills . I would suggest Ticket To Ride for starters . That is a game that takes about an hour , easy to learn , has some luck involved , but much more planning and decision making to keep it engaging . Saying that Monopoly is the worst game of all time may be stretching the truth a bit , but not by much .	-1
I received the 2013 edition of the game not the regular version that I ordered . The 2013 edition only has 12 pieces not the 16 expected and some other & # 34 ; fire and Ice & # 34 ; tokens for giving & # 34 ; special powers & # 34 ; or something . Definitely not what I wanted . Sent it back and ordered the Classic version just to make sure I got the right game .	-1
. . .but I just ca n't get excited by this game.I learned how to play & quot ; Monopoly & quot ; at the age of 5 . My eldest son learned how to play at 8 . My kids enjoy the real game . They do n't enjoy the & quot ; kids & quot ; version.Kids are brighter than most adults give them credit for . The original game is a wonderful teaching tool on a number of levels . I do n't see the point in & quot ; dumbing down & quot ; when it is not necessary.Parents , teach your children how to play the REAL GAME . Then , there can be some valuable family time . The adults will too quickly get bored with this version -- and frankly , so will the kids.Do n't waste your time or money .	-1
My daughter was so excited when Santa brought her this game for Christmas , but she lost interest in about 15 minutes . It takes forever to & # 34 ; Wake Up Daddy & # 34 ; . Very disappointing	-1
This is a nice idea for helping children to become more familiar with the alphabet and words and spelling , but there is one huge drawback . The game uses only capital letters . Children are not typically going to see EGG written , but egg . They wo n't see NEST , but nest . My older two children ( when 4 and 2 ) used to try to match up the dice with the cards on their own ( no rolling , just turning the dice to find the letters ) , and thought it was fun . But , it did n't translate to them recognizing the words in other contexts . It could n't , because the game uses all uppercase letters , whereas in real-life lowercase is used.It also is often difficult to get the letters you need to finish the word , since there are a limited number of dice with lots of letters . You can spend a lot of time just rolling and rolling and rolling , waiting for the right letter to come out . That 's frustrating for little children.Considering the capital letter drawback , the gameplay issue , and that the game is basically heavy-duty cardboard flashcards with several dice , I would pass on this game .	-1
My husband & I love to play boggle so we were excited to find boggle jr to share with our kids . We could n't even finish playing one time . This is not a game . You do n't roll the dice or play in any way . This is a `` learning '' activity , but it is n't fun at all . I am very disappointed in this .	-1
I should have listened to other reviewers . This is nothing more than a set of colorful flashcards . Do n't waste money on this game .	-1
I never cared for this game , I always thought it was silly and really did n't offer much in the way of strategy or skill.I ca n't think of anything really good to say about it , but I know it 's been around for some time , so some people must get into it . If you like strategy and logic or word games like I do , you 'll probably want to pass on this one .	-1
Everything about this game was made more complicated for the 2000 's set ... the board , the gameplay , even the little people pegs are harder to get in the vehicles . Clean-up is not a snap , as there are more confusing pieces . Despite trying three times and following the directions , I still can not get the cover to stay on/be flush with the box bottom . Shoot , I ca n't even follow the general directions for this game . Get the middish-80 's verison in order to have a fun time . Hey , when I play a game , I am trying to escape the reality of life , not re-live it through cardboard and cheap plastic .	-1
My granddaughter , who is 10 , and I love playing this game ; it is updated from the one I used to play when I was a child . I had previously ordered one from another retailer to have at my house for all the kids to play and later ordered this for a 10-year-old girl for a charity at church . I was very disappointed to get a game box with a hole cut out for the spinner and the whole game looks & # 34 ; cheap & # 34 ; next to the one I bought for the house . I will switch them out but recommend you shop around before buying this one .	-1
My 9 year old daughter wanted this for Christmas . Now , I am one to research everything . However , I played this game as a child so I did not think researching was necessary . Well I was wrong . This game is awful . Why they felt the need to mess up a classic I dont know . There are 6 pages of rules to go by . Confusing ones at that . We didnt make it 1/4 of the way through before we gave up , it was that difficult . I am also a teacher and normally I would just donate this to my classroom but not this time . I like my students enough not to subject them to this awful game . Like others I am going to look for the classic version .	-1
If you have ever played the earlier version of life please do yourself a favor and avoid this `` new '' version like the blak plague . My friends and I used to play the old version every single day up to late hours . Once we learned the new version was out we ran and bought it . WHAT A DISAPOINTMENT ! ! ! ! Compared to the old version this one is HORRIBLE . It is n't fun . The new rules [ are not good ] . You can not bet anymore . Money is n't the way it used to be ( what 's with the litte pieces of carton ? ) Maybe if someone at MB reads this they will go back to the basics and bring back what was once a great and fun family game to play . Lucky for us we still have , and play with , our old and much better version of Life .	-1
I remember having fun with the old version as a kid , and it was a much longer game . The new version is so BORING . You get a career , a house , lose money , get paid , and the game is over . There is almost no educational value . Monopoly has 20 times more interest , strategy and educational value than this dud . Please avoid the shock and do not play this game . DEFINITELY DO NOT PURCHASE ! ! !	-1
After growing up playing Life , I was really excited to pick this up at a yard sale . Lo and behold , they have updated it , and not at all in a good way . Maybe it 's more true to `` life '' -- -such as starting out on your way with a bank loan for school -- -but it was all downhill from there . Instead of landing on a career , you select one from a set of cards . Depending on where you land , you have to give other players money ( for instance , your doctor bills go straight to the doctor ) . Plus , we never seemed to really be having a hardship . There was always plenty of money ( thanks to `` Life '' cards that give you , say , $ 250,000 for winning a Pulitzer ) -- -so much so , in fact , that at the end of the game we were really quite overwhelmed with the task of adding it up . My husband also recalled that there was a benefit to having a car full of kids in the old game -- -no such luck here.It was such a bummer that I actually called my parents -- -in their 80s -- -to see if they still had my old version under a bed . Fortunately , they do , so we 'll finally be able to say , `` Hey ! THAT 'S Life ! `` Buyer beware .	-1
i bought the game the other day hoping that my family would enjoy it as much as i enjoyed the old version when i was a kid . this version is horrid . i hate it and wish i could return it . the spinner will not stay in and comes out all the time . the orange squares that force you to stop and re-spin seem like they go against the point of spinning . very very very disappointing . now i have wasted $ 20 and ca n't do anything with the stupid game .	-1
The game is ok , but I was disappointed as this now standard version is a changed , lower budget design of the original game . In general it is cheaply made . A couple pain points is the spinner does not stay in place unless you are very gentle with it , the people always fall out of the cars , and trying to get it all back in the box really does not work.And again , besides the poor quality , the game has been changed I assume to be more politically correct and is not as fun . Try and get the original and skip this version if at all possible.I did see what looked like a much nicer version in a considerably larger box at a major book store retailer ( has two names that start with `` B '' and `` N '' ) . It was at least 2x the price I paid , but I again bet a much nicer , higher quality edition worth the money .	-1
There are many early board games that are so much better than this one . ( Hi Ho Cherry-O is one of my favorites . ) The object is to roll a die to collect the cootie parts to put one together . You have to get the body first , which means you spend the first several turns waiting for a certain number . Many preschoolers will be bored before they even get started . Also , the legs go in at an awkward angle and my four-year-old is frequently frustrated when he ca n't do it himself and when they fall out again . I 'd have given it one star , but the bugs are cute . You might have some fun playing with them if you do n't actually try to play the game .	-1
In looking for fun games to play with our daughter , Cootie was one of those that we snatched up . Remembering playing it as a kid brings back nostalgic memories and so you just assume that it 's going to live up to those memories . Sadly , Cootie does not . First off , the game can drag on and become ridiculously monotonous once you 've attained all body parts except for those six legs . Rolling sixes can become rare and kids especially can become impatient and bored . Then you have the pesky problem of poor craftsmanship which leads to body parts being difficult to attach ( the legs in particular have a hard time going in their intended slots all the way ) or that have a hard time staying attached ( the heads fall off with the slightest movement ) . My daughter had more fun playing with the individual Cooties than actually playing the game , and she would have had more fun had their heads stayed on while she played with them . Alas , she played this yesterday and she 's already over it.So am I .	-1
Okay , it 's Cootie . Most of us know the game . Fun , right ? Well , it should be , but it isn't.One of our kids received this as a gift about 2 years ago . We did try to play it several times , but it was nothing but frustrating . The little parts were so poorly made that the legs and such did not stay in tightly and kept falling out . This was unbelievably disappointing for the kids . It was really just about unplayable . I had to get rid of it.Maybe we were just unlucky or maybe they 're making this cheaply these days . I do n't know . All I can say is I would n't waste your money finding out . There are plenty of better games out there.Junk !	-1
I and my 4 year old son have n't found this game to be that much fun , but I 've found it to be of poor quality as parts fit loosely or too tight ( heads may easily fall off the body ) and male attachment parts too easily break off and get left in the holes.Also , `` MADE IN MEXICO WITH DIE MADE IN CHINA '' .	-1
I bought this as a fun game for me and my son to play . Boy was I wrong ! ! It 's nothing but frustration for us both ! ! ! The pieces DO NOT stick in the bugs and fall off easily . The legs are also horrible to put on ! ! ! The rules of the game are ok but the pieces are absolutely horribly made . I would not buy this again.Also , this is n't the first one we got that did this . My mom brought one home from her work ( she 's a teacher ) and it did n't work either . So it is n't just our version .	-1
Not as well made as the Cootie games of old . The game is very frustrating because the pieces are hard to attach and then do n't stay attached . It was a great game in its day , but with this version the logistics get in the way of fun , making it a game none of us enjoy . Sad .	-1
This game is made very poorly . The pieces all have sharp plastic edges . The cardboard 'parts list ' piece falls apart and rips upon first using it . I would absolutely NOT recommend this game to others . I do n't know if the older version is made better or not . But , if it is , you should get online and find the classic version .	-1
If you like tons of tiny pieces to clean up ... And tons of choking hazards this is the game for you.Pros : Idea is neat , balancing beans until the bowl tips over.Cons : Around 60 tiny plastic beans to clean up.Surface of the bowl has very little traction so beans slide and tip off very quickly.The game is too hard for children under 8 , and not interesting for children over 8.Suggestion : Buy `` Do n't Break the Ice '' instead ... Kids love it and it is made by the same company and runs the same price .	-1
Milton Bradly makes some of our favorite family games , but this is not one of them . It 's cheap plastic , with poor fit and finish . We ca n't get our bean pot to balance evenly , so it starts to tip even before we put the beans on .	-1
I do not recommend this game and can not understand the 4.5 star average rating . Yes , my kids enjoy it . However , it is so poorly put together that its just really , really annoying to play . The plastic pieces routinely fall over , or come off entirely . The person pictures come out quite easily unless you tape them in place , and if you tape them they may not flip properly . It takes maybe 30-60 seconds of `` set up '' time to play a 2-4 minute game . While this isnt the end of the world , I personally find it quite annoying.Here is how the game works : there are around 30 or 40 faces in the game . Each player randomly picks one card from the 40 . Each player has a rack which includes cards for all the faces which are turned away from the opposing player so that only you can see the faces in your rack . Each trait ( for example gender ) is split so that there is a minority ( i.e . there are only 6ish female faces , and 6ish black faces , etc ... ) and a majority ( the remaining faces -- i.e . 20+ are male , 20+ are white , etc ... ) . There are around 10 or so traits , all with this majority/minority trend -- gender , race , glasses , hats , bald , facial hair , etc ... Every person seems to have at least one or more minority traits ( i.e . its a man , but he is bald , or wearing a hat . ) You ask a question , ie `` is it a girl '' and , depending on the answer , flip over the boys/girls on your rack to eliminate them , and by process of elimination , and by asking more questions eg `` is the person bald '' work down till there is only one person on your rack , which must be the person the opposing player picked . Whoever gets down to one left on their rack first ( i.e . figures out who the other player picked first ) wins . Getting lucky and picking the right minority trait to ask about is more useful than good logic.I 'm not overly PC or anything , but I just cant warm to a game the whole purpose of which is asking questions designed to exclude people with minority traits , so you can , by process of elimination , figure out who is left.Moreover , the concept is so simple that I dont think the game is very educational . The kids ( even the very young ) quickly learn the basic concept . Once they learn it , there isnt any real learning left to do . ( Yes , its true an adult can use more advanced logic to pick the `` best '' questions , but good luck explaining that to a young kid . Indeed , I bet there are plenty of adults that would not understand the logic behind selecting an optimal question . ) Skip it .	-1
This would be a great game if it were n't made out of flimsy plastic . It is a pain in the neck to assemble and it constantly falls apart . The little flip-up doors do n't stay hinged properly and if you do n't get the little pictures inserted just-so , they fall out also . We 've played it 3 times and I 'm ready to throw it away . Shame on Milton Bradley for selling such a poor quality game .	-1
This is a great game . I remember playing it as a kid with another child who spoke French . Lots of fun , easy to play , not determined by chance , teaches children how to group into categories and narrow down choices - wonderful.Unfortunately , the new edition is very shoddily designed . The cards are flimsy , and they fall right out of their holders when they 're flipped ( or sometimes when they 're *not* flipped ) .Ultimately , the game is almost totally unplayable ! This is very disappointing to all of us . I 'm going to go see if I can find a vintage copy of this game , and I 'll be contacting the manufacturer about this as well ... though if I have an experience similar to that of a previous poster , I 'll probably get brushed off .	-1
When I saw other people playing with it , I thought it was going to be tons of fun . but then when I bought it it stunk . I played it for one or two days with my brother but afterwords it 's gathering dust in my closet along with Connect Four , Battleship and stuff like that . Do n't get hypnotized by this toy ! ! ! DO N'T BUY IT ! ! !	-1
My two boys did n't find this board game very interesting at all . The game itself is cheaply made . I find the cherries all over the house as they are so small and easy to misplace . My kids prefer chutes and ladders 10x over this one .	-1
The game is poor for young kids and pieces is too small which easily become a harzard things for kids . I am not worry because my son never put stuffs into his mouth but other kids may .	-1
the fruits in this game is way too small for a kid to play with . its sometimes frustrating . i say , there are so many other games available . leave this one out .	-1
I remember this game being much more fun when I was little . but my son is n't that interested in it and neither am I. I would highly recommend the sneaky snacky squirrel game over this .	-1
I love Yahtzee , and for years , I had just used random 6 siders taking from other games , and printed the scorecards off the internet , but I was out shopping and saw this `` classic '' edition in the clearance bin for $ 7 , and thought , `` The dice look cool and maybe its time to get a `` real '' version . So I bought it and took it home and we played it , and now I see why it was in the clearance bin . The black holder for the dice , that is supposed to act as a rolling cup is rubbish . It does n't stand up , so someone has to be constantly holding it upright or all the dice spill out . The dice themselves are cheap , lightweight dice that feel like you could crumble them in your bare hands , and I fully expect them to break at some point . It does come with a full sheet Yahtzee score cards ( yippee ) , and NO rolling tray . Even my moms `` cheap '' Yahtzee game from the 90 's included a really cheap rolling tray . Hasbro has redefined CHEAP for games , a bit too cheap for my taste . Someday I will just buy one of the Deluxe editions and be done with it .	-1
Sorry ... . but to & # 34 ; Old School & # 34 ; eyes , it is hard to use the new and improved ( not ) score cards . Every other column is shaded , but my 50+ eyesight makes the shading hard to see . Please bring back plain , black and white . But it really does n't matter since my last order will last for 10 years . : )	-1
I 'm disappointed that they apparently eliminated the categories & # 34 ; Pair & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Two Pair & # 34 ; , which I felt made the game more fun . Without those , I just do n't feel like playing .	-1
So , you want to buy Scrabble , huh ? You were playing at your Grandmas , and you saw she had this cool version with a rotating turntable , wooden tile holders , nice deep pockets where the letters sit on the board . You decided to buy one yourself here at amazon . You ordered it , excited to have a high quality Scrabble in your own possession . You get it in the mail , you open the box , thrilled to own Scrabble , but then ... . the unthinkable ! ! This ai n't your Grandma 's Scrabble ! ! What they have done , is turn a nice idea into the cheapest thing they could come up with and still call it `` deluxe Scrabble '' . PLASTIC . Everything is PLASTIC . The tiles might be wood , I dunno I did n't bite them , but everything else is cheap , thin plastic . Does n't turn nice like the old version . And the biggest kicker of them all , is the board itself . Gone are the nice deep squares the tiles would sit in - where even if you bumped into the game or table , they would stay put . Now it 's shallow grooves , and you have to be careful not to turn the board to quicky or they 'll move easy.You 're better off buying an old one at a garage sale .	-1
I could not believe this `` deluxe '' version was so poorly made . I have a previous deluxe edition and this one does n't even come close . The tile holders on the board are so shallow and made of flimsy plastic . The tiles constantly come out and mess up the board . The board itself is smaller , the turnstile is n't attached and the overall plastic on the board is cheaply made . I am so disappointed they charge $ 35 for this product and it is going back . I am getting the Onyx Edition from Barnes and Noble instead .	-1
Cheap imitation of the original . I would not recommend this . They are marketed as the original Barrel of Monkeys but these are not them .	-1
Kind of disappointed in this item . We did n't receive red , yellow or blue as described . We received purple which is annoying but does n't affect the product . And there are only 10 monkeys . Lots of other reviewers said 12 . The barrel is not even 1/3 filled . The monkeys themselves are cute and a good size .	-1
Aggravation is one of those eternal classics , and is also known as Wahoo ( Parchisi is another variant of the same basic concept ) . Unfortunately , this edition is not . The board is cheaply made and rather hideous to look at ( I guess that 's all at the expense of `` being cool '' ) . This board has been out since the 1990s , and it 's rather sad this is the only model currently available on the market that I know of . The game goes much faster because of how wonky the marble path is around each home colour ( purple , red , etc ) . The board itself is cheaply made and starts comes apart pretty easily . Also , this board is aimed squarely at little kids , and Wahoo is one of those games that adults can play with equal pleasure.I have an Aggravation board from the 1980s , and that board looks so much more stylish . I wish they had that.If you are wanting a good board , do n't get this one . There are plenty of home made wooden boards available on Ebay and other sources . In the past few years I have bought two different wooden boards off Ebay that were dual sided . One side had a four player version and the other side had a six player version for my wife 's grandma who loves Wahoo . I bought a second one from the same vendor a year or two later with an 8 player game on one side and a 4 player game on the second side . The quality of these boards are great , strong , and durable.Trust me , if you like Wahoo/Aggravation , a wooden board is definitely the way to go ! Much classier and much more appealing to adults as well as kids !	-1
The product they are advertising , the older game with the 5x5 grid , is not what was shipped . We received the 3x3 grid . Now , I have to go through the hassle of returning this game . Based on other people 's reviews , this is not the first time this has happened and this is false advertising . Essentially , you are selling the kiddie version at a 200 % mark up with the hope that some people wo n't return the product . You need to be reported or pull this product .	-1
I 'm giving this only 1 star more because of the seller than the game . It was shown in the photo as the 25 piece Milton Bradley game and the description read & # 34 ; Fit all 25 pieces ... & # 34 ; . It was listed as Prime eligible and I selected 2 day shipping . It took more than a week to arrive and Instead of the Milton Bradley version , I was sent the Hasbro 9 piece game . I bought the game on Amazon but they were not the seller . I have to give props to Amazon , though . I sent the game back the same day it arrived and by the next day Amazon had refunded my money .	-1
So I have ordered this item twice now and both times the item that shows up to the door is the cheap $ 9.99 one which has only 9 piecesHasbro A4754 Perfection GameIt shows up just under the description up top as a new model . Its sold by and fulfilled by Amazon . I love Amazon and have used them for over 4 years so its a little frustrating to have to explain everything to customer service , print RMA , and run up to the post office twice . So just make sure you have receive the correct item . Oh and make sure to order now using smile.amazon.com and have Amazon donate .5 % to your favorite charity . lots of Love Amazon , MikePS Rating is not for product but for wrong delivery twicePPS Sorry Amazon customer support for my venting to you over the phone I know it was not your fault the delivery got screwed up , I was having a bad day	-1
Be very careful when ordering . The photo and description clearly stated this was a 25-piece set . NOT . When it arrived , it was a 9-piece game . l	-1
I bought this one thinking it was the old version due to the picture but it is actually Hasbro 's new connect four version which is definitely not as durable . Annoyed that I was misled but still love the game .	-1
Nice idea . I enjoyed this game when I was little but they sure do n't make them like they used to . I , a 28 year old , found this frustrating to use forget my 3 year old . We played ( and by `` played '' I mean tried to play ) it twice before I threw it out . More junk for the landfills .	-1
This game is not as well made as we older people remember it . One of the heads on the hippos will not even lift up when the lever is pushed and one of them will not retract after the lever is pushed . My daughter likes it if we are the only ones playing because two of them do work . But it does not work like I remember it .	-1
I thought my son would have fun with this game and he did manage to despite it 's overwhelming flaws . The game is horribly cheap and it does n't fit into the box once assembled so in order to put the game away you either have to take all the hippos off ( and they really are n't made well enough for that kind of repeated on and off ) or buy something else to store it in . How hard is it to make a box that the finished game fits in ? Very flimsy did n't last long before breaking . A huge disappointment .	-1
This game has really gone downhill from what it used to be . It is now very cheaply made , the board is n't even one piece , and the marbles are n't even real ... they are plastic ! Sometimes the hippos come off the board while we are playing . It 's a very cheaply made game that was a waste of money . It does n't even fit into the box correctly . We were very disappointed and we are on the look out at garage sales for the original game .	-1
We have the same complaints as others ... this game is sooooo cheaply made , especially for the price ! ! The marbles are light plastic and seamed -- they do n't roll as well as they could . The hippos detach sometimes during play , one seems to not want to ever be attached . The levers get stuck sometimes , sometimes the balls get stuck in their throats . It is all very Flimsy . Trying to store it again is a joke.That said , my kids still like it . It is unbelievably NOISY , and I think that 's what they like , plus it 's very fast paced . I would never play it with a very competitive child , they would drive you nuts complaining about how their hippo was n't working right or whatever . The best part is flipping the balls into play with the springy thing , they pop really high.We play on a carpeted floor , so the board does n't move as much and stray balls do n't get away too badly .	-1
I bought this game for my five-year-old for Christmas because I enjoyed it as a child and because they were out of Moon Sand ! The game comes in pieces -- the square base , the four hippo bodies and four hippo heads . When you put it together , it does n't fit in the box . The instructions suggest taking the hippos off for storage . They have a picture of how to arrange it , but it does n't fit in the box that way . You can tell on the picture the pieces are hanging over the edge . So you have to take at least one hippo head off to make it all fit . Putting it together is n't too much trouble but the pieces are evetually going to wear out and not snap together . I do n't expect this toy to make it until next Christmas unless we find a place to store it out of the box.The game is really fun , parents will even enjoy playing it with the kids . Just do n't expect it last forever .	-1
I loved this game as a child and wanted to buy it for my 3 year old son . Great game , now made into a piece of PLASTIC GARBAGE ! . The light weight marbles are terrible and the heads of my hippos do n't even lift up most of the time.It 's truly a shame they have to ruin these type of games with cheap materials .	-1
I remember enjoying this game as a kid , but it must have been a much higher-quality product than this cheap rendition . From a kids ' perspective , it 's frustrating because the heads often get `` stuck '' in the extended position and wo n't spring back ; from a parent 's perspective , it 's a pain to assemble , and nearly impossible to disassemble ( and you MUST disassemble it if you want to fit it back into the small box . Why they ca n't sell this in a larger box I do n't know , but I guess they 're saving money on packaging ) . If you DO N'T manage to get it back into the box ( which I only did once ) , it must be stored as is , with no receptacle to contain the marbles , and a shape too awkward and bulky to fit easily on a shelf . I finally sneaked this thing away into my give-away pile , after only 6 months of use , and I hope the kids forget all about it .	-1
