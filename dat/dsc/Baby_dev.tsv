There really is n't much this set does n't have . You can read other reviews for the specs . The various items , options , features , and functions are wonderful . It 's very clear a ton of thought , research , and understanding went into this product 's design . The rocking seat , changing table , and bassinet quickly become obsolete , but that 's just picking nits since they are relatively fine products.Two vastly underrepresented features are the storage & portability . I could n't be happier with how easy it is to pack up this playpen and go . The entire play area folds in on itself into a small rectangular shape . All rods and nets fit perfectly within the same frame . The bassinet pad folds perfectly into a rectangular shape that encompasses the entire playpen . The entire thing slides perfectly into the carrying bag . Make no mistake ; this is not one of those designs where `` perfect fit '' is synonymous with `` requires the same strength necessary to pull a stubborn mule through a doorway . '' It 's snug , but easy to insert because there is a zipper that fits to perfect.So , how do you carry this entire thing ? Well lookie there , what does the outside of the bassinet pad have ? A sturdy , fabric handle ? How does that help ... Oh.no.they.di'int . Oh , yes , they did . The carrying bag has a perfect hold for the handle to pop through just to the end of where the zipper finishes . Then the entire thing fits in a snug rectangle that can be stowed away into the dark recesses of a closet or under a bed . Design perfection.I 'd be remiss if I did n't mention the safety and ingenious SafeLatch Technology , something of which I 'm reminded every time I put the playpen up or take it down . The SafeLatch requires the proper sequence for it to work , and the locking system is rigid enough to withstand significant pressure . To undo it 's as simple as pushing a sturdy button . Even if some sort of Hercules toddler were able to push the button hard enough ( unlikely ) , the playpen folds in on itself from the bottom . It 's like standing on a book and trying to read page 50 . Not gon na happen.Virtually zero complaints here . Great product .	1
Have n't use this for the baby yet as I am due next week . but I love this ! I was able to assemble it myself being my husband is currently deployed . It is so cute , and very neutral .	1
We really like the bassinet it has although the awning over it does n't stay very well . We have the bassinet next to our bed on the floor and our little one sleeps very well in it . We do n't use the changing table in it so I wo n't comment on that portion . The play pen portion seems sturdy . WARNING : READ ALL OF THE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE PUTTING TOGETHER ! ! I read the first portion of the instructions and began putting it together not realizing I would have to take it all apart to use it for a newborn . It is difficult to snap the mat into place when using it as a play pen . Other than that , it will be greatly used !	1
I really liked the damask design on this pack n play which is primarily why I bought it . I also liked the changing seat for the downstairs level of our home . The little cuddle cove seat is cute , but we did n't get much use out of it since we have a swing and moses basket and held our newborn most of the time . The changing seat also did n't see much use because it seems to not hold weight as well after baby hits about 12-13 lbs . It seemed to sag and I did n't feel safe changing her in it from then on . It should really have more than just two posts to secure it and make it more sturdy . The changing accessories also are not very easy to travel with as they do n't fit well into the folded up pack n play . Overall , I like this design and would purchase it again if I could choose over again .	1
This really does do it all . Great product and looks nice too . Very easy to assemble . This product is black and cream , not black and white as it looks in some pictures .	1
We love this ! !	1
I love that it 's lightweight and so compact . I used it as a crib for my baby , not because of money , just because I prefer it to the conventional wood crib . I 'll buy a toddler IKEA bed when outgrows this . You can just buy the basic pack-n-play and skip the extras like the napper and diaper changing station . You have to take them out to use the pack-n-play anyway .	1
This is easy to assemble ( took me about 45 minutes ) and very sturdy . The rocking seat has a neat vibration feature that my nephew found very soothing . Out of all the sound options , he liked the nature sounds the best . It 's pretty *and* functional , which seems hard to find in baby products.My favorite part about this pack n ' play is that it 's simple to switch out the accessories and not insanely heavy to lug around .	1
I love this pack n play . Its really cute , sturdy and durable . The little cuddle cove is awesome and the changing table is plenty big and has a nice area on the side for diapers and accessories . The instructions to set it up were completely backwards and complicated though . It told you how to put the pack n play together , and then it told you how to put the cuddle cove , changer , music etc . together , but you had to take things apart in order to do the second part ... they should have switched that around so you didnt have to take things apart that it told you to put together . We put it together in our living room and when I went to put it in the baby 's room , it wouldnt fit through the door ! That was definately frustrating that they would make it just a smidge too wide to fit through a doorway , so again I had to somewhat disassemble it to get it through the doorway . Overall it is a great pack n play , and high quality . Satisfied customer.I have had this pack n play for 8 months now . The changing station is useless . I could never use it-they should have used stroner material so that it would n't bend to one side when you put your baby on it , and no my baby was not big at all..6lbs . So its not a good quality changing table at all . I did use the music maker and the night light it had on it . She slept at our bedside for 5-6 months and I never had to change the batteries . When I had to assemble and dissasemble the pack n play I would put the center down first and then try to assemble the sides last ... do not do that ! It is impossible and very frustrating . My hausband finally figured it out to assemble the sides first and then the center last , and it is a breeze to put together ! When you disassemble pull center out first then take down sides . I dont know why I ever though to do it the other way . I am very happy with this pack n play still ! I must warn though that if you are looking for a light-weight pack n play this one is not for you . It is also quite bulky too , when you `` pack '' up the pack n play the mat does not fit in the bag which i think is a pretty dumb design , but that does n't bug me too much anymore considering i lost the bloody bag . Go figure !	1
This pack and play is very versatile . My baby used the napper as his bassinett for his first couple of months in my bedroom . He loved the naper and still takes naps in it occassionally . There is a vibration button with high and low and the cover is washable . We do go through a lot of batteries , size D for the vibration . The changing table is also a very handy feature , although we have had problems with the changing table not being level . This pack n play is bigger than the standard pack n plays . I also found the music and light a great asset , when my baby was by my bed I could use the night light when I got up at night and the music and nature sounds were very soothing to him .	1
We used the bassinet forever and still use the changing station with our 4 month old . I 'm sure we 'll use the pack n play part forever as well , but we 're really pleased with this purchase !	1
The pack n play is a must for us with our bedroom on the first floor and the nursery on the second . The cuddle cove rocking seat is a life saver and we use it for our newborn at night and during the day taking it around the house with us . She insists on being held and this cove seat is perfect for keeping her feeling cuddled and the vibrating seat helps . The one big downside to this pack n play is the stability of the changing table . My baby is only 7 lbs 5 oz and she keeps rolling to the left as the changer is only held up on the right side . Look for a pack n play with four post support on the changer . I do n't know how long we 'll be able to use it as she gains weight .	1
Perfect for our needs , especially in limited space . We plan to use for as long as possible . I am completely pleased with the quality and features .	1
My 7 month old still sleeps in my room in this . It was totally perfect for her . We did n't use the changing table attachment much but we used the little rocker while she was tiny and after a couple months moved her down to the bassinet . Now she 's starting to pull up and we 've moved her down to the bottom level . the storage thing on the side is mostly just in the way , I do n't really use it . We bought a thicker 3 inch mattress to use with it . If you plan to use this full time , you might want to do that . We recently took this on vacation and it folded up very small and took very little room in the minivan and she had no trouble sleeping on the mattress that comes with it for a few nights .	1
perfect beyond words pack n play ! ! ! We looked through 100s of pack n plays online and at stores , and finally decided on this one.. I love EVERYTHING about this pack n play ! ! The infant napper/rocker seat is an absolute god send ! ! The vibrations put babies RIGHT to sleep : D and the convience of the changing table add on is amazing ! ! My only complaint would be that for some reason ours did not include assembly instructions ... If I had been a single mom.. I would have needed to call in the help of a experienced man-builder lol but in general ... Everything goes together quite easily and is super fast to break down and pack back up ! I am giving it 5 stars because Im sure it was a factory fault that we did n't get the instructions and does not depreciate the value of such an awesome pack n play !	1
The Rittenhouse fabric looks very sophisticated . I like that the Pack 'n Play is very sturdy , as well as the rocking seat and changing area . I purchased the changing pad cover from Graco to keep the actual changing pad clean . If I had any advice about setting up the Pack 'n Play it would be to set aside atleast an hour to set up all of the components . It is not the easiest to assemble , but if you have to take your time and follow the directions you will be ok .	1
I seriously love this thing . ONE problem . They NEED to make an adapter for the changing pad so it does n't slump . Seriously . Other than that this is perfect . I prefer a separate bouncer for our house but for travel having the one that comes with this is very nice . The pattern is sweet - good for a boy or girl . And sturdy ! I could see this lasting a whilleeeee . So , if irish twins are in your future this thing could see some use ; )	1
Love this pack and play , have been using it everyday since the birth of my daughter and now she 's 3 months old . Just perfect .	1
I just received and installed the thing . We have n't used that yet as the baby is not here yet but the product looks strong and easy to install . Its worth the value as compared to the price in stores like babiesrus etc . Moreover there was a price reduction on the item after i had made the purchase ( within next two days ) . The customer care rep immediately refunded me the money when I notified .	1
Bought this playard for our firstgrandchild and we just love it ! Easy to put together , looks sturdy and like the vibrating tray/chair , and the changing area can be used for sleeping infant if placed on the floor or low down inside playard as a newborn . Only dislike is that is n't as easy to take apart to travel . Somewhat heavy and not too compact but will work . The good qualities out-weigh the negative .	1
I really love this pack and play . The wheels make it easy to roll all over the house . We wanted to have our son in the room with us but the regular style bassinet someone loaned us , he did not like . We wheeled this into our bedroom and he slept in the bassinet at night for over a month . Love the convenience of the changing table . We have now removed the bassinet but are still using the changing table- my son can lay on the mattress ( even raised ) and not touch the changing pad ( yet ) . I also like the vibrating feature for the bassinet that is now attached to the mattress it soothes my son well.The few negatives are the side storage is n't as sturdy as I would like . It is still nice that it is there though holding diapers , wipes and lotions . Another consideration is assembly . This would not be a good `` pack '' and take on vacation pack and play . I would recommend borrowing , second hand shopping , or buying a smaller more simple pack and play for that .	1
I think I tried to talk myself out of buying this about 20 times to save money by purchasing a less expensive pack n play . I 'm so glad I decided to go ahead and splurge ! So worth it . We keep this one in our living room and it is incredibly convenient . The only downfall I 've found is that I have a big baby and he 's already outgrown the napper at 6 weeks . His legs scrunch up ! But I 'm sure most mom 's wo n't have this issue . The side compartment does sag a little , but it does n't bother me . I love when company comes over and they tell me how cool it is and how `` when I had babies , they did n't have things like this ! '' . I never write reviews , but I had to say that if you 're a new mom trying to make a decision , go with this one . You wo n't regret it !	1
This is the BEST CHOICE for new parents . I bought it as a giftThe napper is midway between the top and the bottom and really makes it easy to set baby down asleep- it saves your back from an otherwise long bend and is perfect for babies not old enough to sit up . And removed napper leaves a deep bed at the bottom which easily and safely will hold a baby up to at least 2 years old.The material is excellent and although first assembly takes awhile it really is easy to set up and pack upPerfect for home and travel and sturdy enough to last for yearsThe battery operated mp3 connection also has vibrate settings for the napper and the removable bassinetUnfortunately the description did not say & # 34 ; batteries not included & # 34 ; I also bought the graco urban lite stroller and car seat - vance as gift for same person - and having everything match is another plus ! New parents these days usually have smaller homes and this is the perfect alternative to a crib , changing table and bassinet it maximizes smaller spaces and easily packs for travel across the street or across the country . Most airlines accept these as carry on luggage ! The order was promptly processed and shipped very fastI definitely recommend this item	1
Guao , is nice and practical playard . You can store it in their bag carry and to carry it to travel with your baby . It is easy to assembly , althought , is a bit difficult to understand the assembly on the manual , but does not matter , because if you are recursive , you found the way . We hope that with the baby it works good . Our baby does not been born yet , but we are already ready for wait for him . Later , I will do an updating about it , if we have any trouble , but so far , the packing and product are very good.Already mi son born , and we are happy with this playard . Is really nice ! . I will recomend it this product always , oh yes ! . The newborn napper station is very helpful , and the bassinet for change the clothes is very helpful also .	1
As a first time Grana , I am very particular to review and buy quallity products for our princess . After reading online reviews about the weak changing table on the Cuddle Cove , we chose this Napper Elite . The parents were over last evening , and they remarked about how sturdy the table was compared to their Cuddle Cove . Our baby only weighs seven pounds , and their Cuddle Cove changing station is already leaning downward when changing her diaper . We are very happy with the Napper Elite . Only wish that all of these came in cuter designs , but I 'll change it up with blankets , mobiles , etc .	1
We lived in a two story condo when we brought our baby home.This was absolutely perfect for downstairs . I would absolutely buy this again because it served us so well .	1
This product would have gotten 5 stars if some parts of the storage section was well made and the napper station was detachable , but overall I love this pack N Play . The MP3 docking station , changing table and the stable diaper storage makes up for other mishaps .	1
This was given as a gift . The new expecting any day parents loved it & said it 's everything they wanted and more . I love that it will be able to be used for an entire year . Making me feel like they will get my monies worth . ; D Also purchased an extra mattress & sheet.Thanks for the guaranteed delivery , It was delivered as promised . Love , love dealing with Amazon . They always offer quality products that stores charge more for . Delivery is tracked with dependable UPS excellent service , Thanks so much Amazon & UPS ! ! !	1
We have been using this pack n play for about a week in our bedroom for our newborn and the newborn sleeper is great . The changing table does n't work great for us as it is not level and baby rolls/slides to one side . It is also sort of low and not comfortable for us . The accessory pouch is nice but not very sturdy . We have not yet used the music attachment .	1
Pros : The changing table is sturdy unlike many other pack n playsThe newborn napper provides the option of a slight inclineCons : The changing table does not flip over the side as it would in most pack n plays . It remains over the baby/ bassinet . However , this makes it sturdier.The storage attachment is basically useless . The diaper holding section will do it 's job but the rest will not . It is not strong enough to function as shown in the picture.The newborn napper is not easily removed for washing . It is washable , but re- assembling it is not easy . There is n't a cover that can be easily removed and washed .	1
Out of the pack n plays I really wanted a side pocket item that could hold diapers and things . This is downstairs in our living room , so I do n't want to cart things back and forth . It 's also nice that if I want to take if off , I simply un-clip it . The napper was nice when my son was small , we actually still use the changer , he is nine months , but I think we are going to stop it since the weight limit is close to where he is . Overall it is great and so easy to pack up .	1
This pack n play has all the bells and whistles . Unfortunately for us , we probably did n't need half of them . The Newborn Napper is a SIDS safety hazard according to Consumer Reports and the Baby Bargains book , so we never used that . We never used the music or vibrate feature . We did use the changing pad a few times , but it is kind of cumbersome to travel with and takes up a lot of car space . Loved the side organizer ( one of the reasons why we bought it ) , but it just became one more thing to pack up.If you are wanting a pack n play to travel easily with , just know that the main piece ( without the napper , changer , organizer , or rods to raise the mattress up ) is fine . We started leaving all the other stuff at home once baby could roll over and was sleeping on the bottom level anyway . If you are using this as a second sleeping space/changing station on another level of your home , this is great . All in all , we got it as a gift , so I do n't have any regrets that we have such a nice one , but it is a LOT of stuff . Be prepared to scale down when you actually take it out of your home .	1
We like it- but the extras were a little unnecessary for us ... The changing table became a sweater holder and she did n't like the shape of the napper so I took that out . The organizer is awkward . She is only a month old but I will say she let us know she did n't like the napper right away . So she is on the booster part next to our bed.The vibrator works a little too well , lol , if the napper is touching our bed it vibrates our bed too . She seems to like it so no issues . They were sturdy and seemed to be built well so no loss to their rating because she dosnt like the position of the napper and that I did n't use the changer.-1 star due to the 'pack and play ' is not so portable and some muscle needed to set up and tear down .	1
We got this primarily for the design and we could n't be happier with it . Gender neutral look , nice color tones . Our baby never liked the napper , so we used the bassinet from day one . The changer slants slightly so the baby kind of rolls toward you during a changing which is n't that great . The side storage is good for the wipes and powder , etc , but we did n't really need it since we always had the pack n play near a dresser where we could keep things . Also , we never used the vibration or ipod player since our phones play music and we can just play music straight from phones . If you want this for the design , get it . If you prefer a different design that does n't have these features , do n't worry that you 'll be missing anything getting the version with less features .	1
I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews , but I love this Pack N Play . The colors and style are so classy and will be great for my baby boy and even a future baby girl ... if I have one : ) I like the changing table and storage on the side . It works well for what we need . We just keep this in our room where the baby will sleep for the first few months until we move him to his crib in the nursery . The storage is nice for extra diapers , wipes , etc . We do n't use it as our main storage , just for a few things to make night changes easier.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it 's a little tricky to put together and taking off the napper and changing station is cumbersome and annoying ... but eventually we wont use those items and will just use the bassinet and bottom part so it 's not a big deal for us .	1
I used this when my daughter was a newborn and I am still using this pack and play . The newborn part is great and really comfortable for you and your baby . The changing station could be a little higher , and the diaper station is a bit flimsey , but I couldnt be happier with this . I will be using this for our second baby , I just dont want to put the dang thing together again !	1
I purchased this Pack 'N Play hoping to make use of all the storage space , the changing table and the napper . I 'm 8 months into its use and I 'm still very happy with it.Pros : - Very easy to assemble . Take your time and follow the instructions . The only difficult portion was the Napper.- Works great as a portable crib , including using the bassinet level . It 's easy to stand up and take down with little effort . Just read the instructions and practice with it.- The changing pad locks right in and is solid . Mine never leaned like some of the reviews say . My daughter is now 8 months and we STILL use the changing table.- The napper and the bassinet can be attached to a vibrating piece . I used it often and never replaced the batteries . You can also connect to an MP3 player for lullabies or white noise . While there are no volume controls on the Graco pieces , you can adjust the volume on the MP3 player.Cons : - While the napper was great for my baby and she loved sleeping in it , it 's difficult to put together . Once it 's together , keep it connected until you no longer use it.- The storage piece attaches to the side with Velcro straps and plastic hangers . The storage piece does n't seem to hold up well after long-term use , but I also stored heavy wipes in there . I still use the storage space for diapers , burp towels , bibs and creams . Just keep out the heavy items . Everything still stays inside , so I 'm able to live with it .	1
We live in a mobile home and I take care of my granddaughter and needed something compact . This is great . Easy to put together . Sturdy for sure and the changer is perfect for me with a bad back . Love the music and light options . So much for your money . Cleans easily . As she grew out of the cuddlier I stored it under the mattress since it is still being used in the highest position . Worked out great for me .	1
When I was expecting my daughter I debated whether or not a pack n play would be a wise purchase . I was really on the fence about it due to the price , and due to living in a small 2 bedroom condo . I sort of looked at this as something that would be impractical for someone who did n't have a larger home and who possibly planned to use this downstairs if the nursery was upstairs.I could n't have been more wrong . My daughter slept many nights in this in my room , and it brought me peace of mind having her close at night . It 's also been wonderful for travel . Whenever we 've stayed somewhere for a night or two this only takes a couple of minutes to break down and set back up . Honestly do n't know what I 'd have done without it.Although my daughter has outgrown the newborn napper I will continue to use this for a long time to come as a play pen . Even for those moms-to-be , like myself , who do n't agree with or foresee themselves ever using a play pen , it really is a necessity in my opinion . Being home alone with her all day it 'll be a total lifesaver when she becomes more mobile , so that I can safely contain her if I should need to step away for a couple minutes to take a shower or an important phone call . So many uses for this little pack n play that it more than justifies the price .	1
Our son probably spent the first 3 months in the bassinet to nap and we considered it a life saver . It was easy to assemble , the pockets on the bottom were extremely helpful and 99 % of the diaper changing went on there . I 've only recently started to use it as a play pen - or at the very least , a way to keep him contained while I 'm doing a few quick chores - and it 's just as helpful as it was in the earlier stages . I was surprised how easy it was to fold up and pack away when we did n't need it . I would easily recommend this to another mom .	1
We picked this playard for the storage . It is good quality and will be very helpful . I just wish it was another color the brown is not pretty .	1
This Pack 'n Play is compact and good if you have limited space . It 's really nice to have a changing table . My husband and I not only use the shelves for storage , but the space underneath the changing table to store diapers , wipes , etc . My favorite thing about this though is the light at the end of the napper . I 'm not into co-sleeping , but I do pull the Pack 'n Play next to our bed at night and then turn on the light - that way my baby is close and I can see her ! It was a pain to put together , so far it 's been good for us .	1
Our baby is six weeks old and so far this Pack N Play is the item that has gotten more use than any other single baby item we own , matched perhaps only byFisher-Price Zen Collection Cradle Swing.Our original plan was to put the baby to sleep at night in a bassinet that someone had given us , however we noticed that the baby laid really flat in the bassinet . She seemed uncomfortable , and she tended to roll to one side . Also , we were worried that she might choke if she spit up in her sleep while laying flat on her back in that bassinet . So , we opted to set up the Pack N Play in our room instead , and to use the `` napper '' attachment as a bed . If I had known how very useful this thing was going to be , I probably would have stopped my wife from converting our guest room and office into a baby room that does n't even really get used . From now on , my advice to new parents will be that a Pack N Play is the only baby furniture you need for the first few months of the baby 's life , so do n't worry about a crib , dresser , changing table , or bassinet . All of those are included in the Pack N Play.There are a few minor imperfections in this thing , and that is the reason I give it four stars instead of five . I will highlight the good and bad below.GOOD : '' Napper '' attachment - This has actually served as a bed for our newborn baby . It is very soft and she sleeps well in it . We also like that it keeps her at a slightly inclined position so that she breathes better and wo n't choke if she should spit up in her sleep.Electronics - The music has served as a lullaby not only for the baby , but also for me and my wife . We put the music on every night , even if the baby is already asleep . Also , the vibrating base has really helped when the baby has gas . There is a built-in timer , so it will save the battery life too . I just did the first battery change after six weeks of daily use.Shelves - We actually have n't used them yet because we have n't taken it on a trip yet , but that is going to be very convenient when we take it on a trip.Changing table - It is nice to have an attached changing table with nice steep sides . My wife 's mother came and stayed with us to help out for the first couple weeks of the baby 's life , and we had to put her up in the nursery on an air mattress , so we did n't have access to the changing table in the nursery for those late-night diaper changes . This was a suitable alternative , and was much better than just using a changing pad on the bed or floor . The steep sides keep the baby securely enclosed , so if you need to step away for a second to grab a diaper or something you do n't have to worry about the baby rolling off . There is one problem with it that I will mention later.BAD : Assembly : OK , so the basic bottom unit assembles fairly easily . You just pop it into place and put the pad in . If you ignore the unnecessary step that calls for turning it on it 's side and digging out the velcro loops to attach , you can have that basic assembly finished in a minute or two very easily . The difficulty comes when putting on the other accessories . The directions call for putting the release buttons face down on the napper , but if you do that it is incredibly difficult to take the napper back out again . My advice would be to install the napper with the release buttons face-up . They are very stiff buttons and there is no way that an infant could release them , so there is not a safety concern , but you need to see them to really release them properly so if you follow the directions and put them face-down there is a sanity concern . If you disregard the velcro straps and install the napper with the buttons face-up , assembly is not so bad . It took me about an hour to assemble the first time , but much of that was the napper and velcro . Can you imagine getting off a long flight or car trip and spending another hour to put together a pack n play before finally relaxing ? Forget it.Portability - Again , this is not a problem with the basic bottom unit . The outside rails fold up and the four-piece pad wraps around them to make a nice portable unit that you can pack up and throw in the car . However , there is no storage for the poles , the shelf unit , the napper , or the changing table , so you must carry all of those items separately . We have not been on a trip yet , but I imagine I will have to carry a separate duffle bag to hold the parts that do n't pack up with this unit.Changing table - As I mentioned earlier , this is a great feature to have , and we do get use out of it when there is a guest staying in the nursery and we ca n't get to the regular changing table . The only problem with it is that it does n't sit flat . I have tried adjusting it , but no matter what I do it tends to lean towards the outer rail . Maybe this is meant to compensate for the baby 's weight and will correct itself when my daughter weighs more . Right now , it causes her to roll when I am changing her unless I prop her in the corner . When you have a kid like my daughter , who prefers to take a second pee as soon as her diaper is loose , any rolling around translates to a big mess , and that was a lesson I had to learn the hard way on this changing station . I am still glad it is there , I just wish it was more flat.Toy bar - I guess it was nice that they included the toy bar with the velcro flowers , but my daughter does n't seem to pay much attention to it and it does n't attach very securely to the napper . It would have been better if the put loops on there so you could attach some of the other universal toys , and it would have been better if it secured to the napper more firmly because this one pops off all the time.Overall , I am very pleased with the Pack N Play , and I would suggest that every parent invest in one . I will come back and update my review if I notice anything else worth mentioning .	1
We use this EVERY DAY . The bassinet is amazing and was the only place I was able to get our daughter to nap for the first 2 months . The vibrating feature and the music saved my sanity . I also like that we had one place to store all our baby gear downstairs instead of having to run upstairs to change her diaper , outfit etc . Definitely recommend .	1
We have decided to use this with our newborn . It is in our bedroom next to the bed . The bassinet is secure and comfortable . The nightlight is perfect for late night feedings . The added storage compartment is perfect for storing extra diapers and wipes.Assembly was a little difficult . Be sure to assemble in the room you plan to use it in.The wheels make it easy to move around the room once assembled ; however , it does not fit through doorways .	1
I just received this for our baby due in Febuary . I ca n't comment on how the baby likes it yet but I will review the product based on quality , durability , features , usage portability and setup . First I took out all the pieces of the box and every thing was there . Had no problems with missing pieces . The package arived on day three instead of day two but it was a holiday so understandable . The instruction manual is kind of a joke . The instructions were vauge and the pictures at times were not helpfull . In fact , some of the pictures used , you could not even tell what was the pictures were of and in some cases made the setup harder than it needed to be . It took me about 45 minutes to an hour to set up , being my first pack and play and all and it has a lot of extra features , I feel that was too long . Unfolding it and using it as a play pen it very easy and portability for that use would be outstanding , however , thats were it ends . If you need to use the bassinet feature , sleeper or changing table , it becomes a hassle . the changing table is n't to difficult to attach or de attach but the sleeper on the other hand , once its installed forget about portable . fork lifting a port a potty from one spot to the next is easier than this . the bassinet is n't too difficult setting up , especially after you done it once , but taking it apart is somewhat difficult because the support rods are two poles that connect with one another and almost refuse to come apart . you will spend at least 5-10 minutes fighting that to take apart . The storage underneath is a nice feature and will make it easy to store lightweight items such as diapers , towels , wipes , maybe a few changes of onsies and etc ... keeping us from funning back and forth from the nursery . the & # 34 ; play bar & # 34 ; that has the toy stars on it is just light velcrow squares that are on the star and a small strap and connects using the velcro . I can see that baby would probably disconnect it easily and alot . the play bar is not solid and fairly flimsy . The unit itself looks very nice and and every thing , once installed does seem pretty solid and safe for baby . If you plan on having a & # 34 ; portable pack and play & # 34 ; this is probably not your number one choise but for the cost and amount of features , it is very nice . It also includes a vibrating thing and music soothing thing and the unit itself seems to be of top notch quality and design . I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good priced tpack and play that is jam packed with features and includes storage . If you want something made for portability maybe consider other options first but you wo n't be very disappointed if portability isnt an issue .	1
This thing is really well made . The design makes sense , and the only thing that I had a little bit of trouble with was trying to figure out how the little storage compartments fold out so they 're not so flimsy . With the re-inforced velcro , they do pretty well at storing things . The little bassinet seems very comfortable . Our daughter sleeps like a bug in a rug in it , and the changing area/table seems to be pretty well made/designed too.The only things that I was n't sure on the little light , music thing . The light is not really functional when the Pack 'n Play is fully configured like in the picture ( you 'd have to see it ... ) but the light shines either above or below where you want it to be . It 's not a really big deal , but just a little thing.The only other thing , was the changing table was a little slanted at first . Our daughter kind of rolled off to one side for a while , but I fiddled with it and I think I finally got it the way it 's supposed to be ( i.e . more level ) .Neat product and I would recommend it for other parents : )	1
My little one is due in April , so I ca n't attest to her using it yet or how she naps , changes , and uses the other features of this pack n play , but it is stocked and set up and I love it . My one and ONLY con with this , is how difficult this was for me to set up . I 'm sure it has to do with the fact that I am due in 42 days and my tummy got in the way at the very beginning , when simply trying to snap the sides into place . Then , this is also the first pack n play I 've ever seen , let alone set up , and there are many parts . Due to my excitement , I also set up the pack n play without reading the entire book first , I 'm went from page to page and set up as I was reading the guidebook ... . Wrong to do if you want to set up each part up to the napper and change table . This led to me having to take apart things I already put in place , like the mattress ... Sigh . Maybe if I would have been patient , lol.However , I love the look and feel of this now that it 's all in place . I have already decided that I will not be traveling with this while little one can use the napper and changer and storage space still . It is too much of a hassle to take the napper in and out daily , if going from one place to the next . I ended up getting a stand alone napper for traveling with her instead . It seems to be more easily portable once the tiny infant stage is passed and the play pen is being used and that 's it.So ... If you do n't need to be super-portable and will use this around your home , this is just fine . Keep in mind that the napper and change table must be used with the pack n play ... They are not independent of the unit . If you are a big time mover and shaker ... I would n't bother with this . It 's too much of a hassle for fast-padded parents . For my personal needs ... I love it !	1
loveeeee it . being 8 months pregnant , it was pretty easy to assemble myself . i like the storage shelves under the bassinet . i can keep extra wipes/diapers/clothes there . changing table is easy to remove . newborn basket is a little bit tougher to take out .	1
This is an all-in-one convenience station ! I never used the hanging stars , they just got in the way . The bassinet keeps a nice round shape for the head . The diaper changer wipes clean pretty well , and yes the soft shelves do bend a bit but I would n't give up those shelves ! just do n't fill them too full . Diapers & clothes work just fine in the shelves.The only things I did n't like about this are- Not tall enough as a diaper changer . After a hundred diaper changes ( about 1 week ) my back was complaining . I got some bed risers for it http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XNGPE6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_98 and that did the trick.- Smelled heavily like plastic out of the box . I set this up and let it air out for about 2 months before using it and that seems to take the smell out . If you are sensitive to smells you will want to give this plenty of time to air out .	1
No baby yet . I am 37 weeks pregnant and just put this together . Assembly is very difficult , and I say this having put together , sometimes with and sometimes without my husband , 2 large pieces of ikea furniture a rocker/glider , and a storage unit . By far this was the most difficult thing to assemble . I followed the suggestion from the top comment on putting together the napper , and that was quite helpful when it came time to disassemble.Speaking of disassembling , I had to in order to get it from the living room , where I first put it together , to the bedroom , where i plan to sleep the baby . We live in a small east coast apartment and I was really looking forward to saving space and money by being able to roll this from the bedroom to the living room depending on where I was . It is too wide for our bedroom door frame . Probably most people will not have this problem , but you might note the dimensions and measure your door width just in case . It 's a real disappointment to me that I ca n't move this from room to room and will have to find another container/holder for baby for the living room.All that said , it seems nice . I 'll update once baby is here , but the product itself seems to be good quality . The storage shelves made me choose this model over other Graco Pack N Plays , and it really is a good deal of room . The toy bar does not attach very sturdily though . Still , I 'm happy with it.Update 10/13/13 : The baby is here and she is 10 weeks old today . We have used this pack and play everyday . It is where we change her diapers and she has been sleeping in the newborn napper almost every night . She is under 11 lbs , but already starting to get a little long for it . She 'll probably size out of it by 12-14 weeks , and that 's okay . As I said above , I ca n't move it from room to room , but so far that has n't been so bad . I put her down in a bouncy chair in the living room . Not sure how that will work once she 's mobile and I want something to contain her for when I step away , but I 'll cross that bridge when I get to it.Oh , and do n't really use the sound module . The sounds are so soft they ca n't really shush a baby , actually they 're barely audible . And my baby could n't care less about that vibration thing .	1
This was a great price and Graco makes a good quality product , BUT if I had to do it over again , I would n't have bought it with the napper and changer . Seems to be too much trouble that is unnecessary . Also , was a little bit difficult to assemble and heavy . Definitely not a traveler .	1
I know many parents struggle with getting a regular P & P ; or one like this with the Napper and Changing Table . GET THIS ! I used to care for several children as a nanny , and all of them had a P & P ; like this one . The napper is SO convenient when they are little bitties and the changing table is helpful as well , though I normally just change my daughter on my bed.I put this next to my bed , with her sleeping in the napper , and when she would wake in the middle of the night to feed , I 'd reach over and grab her then put her back when we were done . For parents who are n't using the crib right away , this is best . I felt comfortable putting her in the napper vs. the flat bassinet because the napper was at an incline ... helping with spit up and choking.The storage underneath is great as my daughter has an endless amount of clothing . I use this as a storage place for her next size up clothing since I have a dresser for her items she is currently wearing.I have heard that this is a real PITA to take apart when you want to get rid of the napper and changer . Not looking forward to this but I absolutely love this P & P . ; ***UPDATE***My daughter is 5 months old now and I use this as her daytime nap spot . I took the napper and changing table off when she was about 2.5 months old since I had already transitioned her to laying flat in a P & P ; bassinet while we were on vacation . I had help doing it , but the trick is to use a screwdriver to push down/in the silver buttons and then you can disassemble it with ease . The changing table just pops right off . I was able to fold them down and store them underneath the bassinet in the P & P . ; I also store her extra sheets in it also .	1
With my son we bought just a cheap pack and play , because we needed it then and I did not know much about pack and plays . It was one of the worst pack and plays ever ! My husband was the only one that could get it up and down ! Even he said a lot of swear words , lol , dealing with it ! When our son grew out of it , I swore I was never going to buy another pack and play like that ! When I became pregnant with our daughter , I read reviews about almost every pack and play out there ! Went to the stores and tested them out ( how many swear words you would say getting it up and down ) . The Graco & # 34 ; won & # 34 ; . The store did not have the print I liked , so I ordered this one . Lets just say I was 8 months pregnant and put the whole thing together by myself ! We currently use it as a bassinet in our room ! We are in love with this pack and play ! Cons : *Personally , I do not like the changer thing . It made sense when we had her in the napper , but now that she is sleeping in the bassinet part , it just got in the way . * The toy bar with the napper is just silly to me . A newborn is not going to & # 34 ; play & # 34 ; with it . We never put it on . * The music is not good . Some of the songs are a little stimulating and not soothing . The nature sounds are good though.Pros : * The vibration setting ! My daughter loves it . The first vibration setting seems a bit too & # 34 ; hard & # 34 ; , but the second is perfect . * The napper was great for when my daughter was a newborn . She loved being held and this gave her that same feeling . * It is so easy to put together and to take it down ! * Love how the mattress is really padded . * Love the storage at the bottom . We do not have to go to the nursery to get anything .	1
I love this mat ! We use it in the living room for my son 's & # 34 ; corner. & # 34 ; The only problem now is that he 's figured out how to take it apart and he will walk around with the squares ! But other than that , we love it , especially since we have hardwood floors ! Not sure if it would work out so well on carpet .	1
These mats are perfect . I 'm glad I read the other reviews in advance and learned the dinosaurs come out of the mat . If I had n't known that , I would have been surprised but I actually like that feature for as the baby grows -- a floor puzzle !	1
This is exactly what I was looking for . We have hardwood floors , and my 7 month old is crawling around , and I needed a play area for him . This helped me create a space just for him , and it 's much more exciting than the boring alphabet and numbers that they sell in the stores . Woohoo dinosaurs ! I 'm thinking of getting a second one to make his space bigger .	1
It 's hard to find these playmats in cute designs . I fell in love with this one ! Great quality ! We have hardwood floors throughout the house , so we used half of these in the living room so he can play without knocking his head on the hardwood floors because he is still a wobbly sitter . It 'll be very useful when he starts to crawl as well . Comes with plenty ! We split them in half and put half in the living room and half in his bedroom . He loves trying to pull the dinosaurs up ! : )	1
Perfect little mat to protect your little one while they are learning to roll , crawl or just move around . My son is 6 months and he loves his mat . We have n't had any problems with it not staying put . Very colorful !	1
We have all wood floors so I was looking for a playmat to protect my son 's little knees when he was learning to crawl . I already had a solid color tadpoles mat and was looking for another I could add to that . This dino mat is wonderful and so adorable . It fits perfectly with the other tadpoles mats . The foam is about 1/4 of an inch thick but it 's more than enough padding to protect my little guy from the hard floor when he falls over or when he crawls across the room . It 's very easy to put together and we had fun creating patterns with the various colors . We received a slightly different variation of color squares than shown in the picture ( i.e . more green squares than blue ) but it really does n't make a difference.My son likes to pull the edges off and play with them , but still ca n't quite pull the actual squares apart . The dino cutouts are adorable . It 's very easy to clean with a wet cloth and the foam has held up well , even in our living room where we walk across it daily . We love this mat so much we 're buying a second to add to the ones we have . For the price this is the best playmat out there . And it 's not an eye sore in our living room . We get tons of complements from our friends about great it looks in our living room .	1
My daughter is addicted to dinosaurs and loves this mat . It is great quality for a good price and I could n't be happier .	1
This is a great play mat and very easy to put together . My five month old really seems to like it and it makes it easier for little accidents ( spit up at this age ) to be cleaned up without having to get out carpet cleaning solution or the like . Took about five minutes to assemble .	1
These playmat from Tadpoles are the best : easy cleaning , great for a baby learning to walk or to prevent scratching a wood floor in the play areas . The colors are vibrant and kids can make their own color scheme . We have already the pawprint playmat , but I like the dinosaurs one much more , when you move the mat somewhere else , the dinosaurs are less likely to come out like the little toes in the pawprint mat .	1
This mat is fantastic ! My son and I love how the dinosaurs can come out of the mat . He is not only comfortable on the patio sitting on it but pulls out the pieces and it gives the play area an extra touch . We love it . I really recommend this one , it is money well spent	1
I bought 2-3 packs of this mat to put it in my son 's room . Did not want the alphabet number mat everyone has . This fit the bill . It was super easy to put together and helps cushion a wobbly toddler from falling down . Of note , on bare feet , your feet will make these sticker peeling noise when stepping on the mat since mat has texture on the surface this not a smooth surface . Overtime , we did notice that the thickness of the mat sightly decreased and packed down due to it being stepped on a lot .	1
Yes , little ones will try to chew on these and that will introduce toxins into their system . BUT , they 're incredibly cute ( colors are truly as bright as pictured and dinos are cuter than the standard letter set ) , provide a great texture for the floor ( soft enough to prevent head injuries and knee pain but firm enough to allow for tower building and whatnot ) , and are n't that much of a pain to replace when pulled up ( much better than the construction version by the same brand because each dino is a single piece ) . One other negative : the set looks much bigger online ; we had to buy six sets to cover the corner of our living room we wanted to designate a play area .	1
This mat is so cute , and perfect for my new sitter . He loves the pattern and trying to pull out the pieces . And when he falls over it provides good padding . It wipes up nicely from any messes , and as long as you do n't make a practice of walking on it , it stays clean . I was worried it might be a little small , but actually it is perfect . It looks great in our living room too .	1
We ordered this mat for our 6 month old and we all like it a lot . The colors are nice and the dinosaur shapes are fun , and most importantly , it provides a cushy place to play . He likes the chew on the edge pieces , and has recently developed the dexterity to take them off himself , so I do n't know how long it will hold up ( we 've had it for about 2 months now ) but it 's a great product for the price .	1
I have a set of these from another company and the way that you attach those is by velcroing around the stroller handles . This means though that when you put your hands in , the Velcro scratches you.With these ones you do not have that problem . They slide over the handles . They are warm and soft and awesome , and stay on and do not compromise steering in the least.Highly recommend if you live anywhere that gets under 50 degrees .	1
First of all let me just start of by saying I dislike gloves bc I always need to reach into my handbag to get my metro card for the subway , money for my coffee or answer my iPhone . Well now that a baby is in the picture it 's even more of a challenge to keep gloves on when you need to be getting a bottle , getting a binky , getting a burp cloth , getting the baby ! With these you take your hands out whenever you need to no fuss it 's warm and amazingly convenient highly recommended for the busy winter mom on the go ! !	1
I really like these . I keep them attached to the stroller in the winter . My son 's nanny walks him every afternoon and loves them too !	1
I LOVE these . I ca n't believe I waited so long to get these warmers . These have been a lifesaver the past few weeks in the Northeast- it 's been freezing ! I have talked to other moms and everyone swears by these- I would say these are a must buy for any moms that are out and about in the cold !	1
Ok , when I first saw these I was n't sure . I was buying them for my husband who walks in the early mornings with our son . I thought they might not keep his hands warm and that they would look goofy ... ... WE LOVE THEM ! ! ! ! I highly recommend them . They keep your hands so warm . It makes me feel good to know my baby is this warm in the 7 am enfant bag . When its 19 degrees outside and you can barely feel your face your hands are nice and warm in these . BUY THEM ! ! !	1
Great and easy attachment to my MacLaren buggy , Baby Jogger double stroller and single buggy . Easy to take on and off and protects my hands from the bitter cold , although you still have to touch the cold handle underneath , which quickly warms up ! ! The only drawback is the price . These are expensive . They are worth it if your winters are severe , long lasting and you 'll get a few winters use out of them .	1
Great diaper for reasons already mentioned by other reviewers : double gusset , two-layer insert . Just wish I had bought the size 1 when my son was first born to get more use out of it !	1
weve got couple of these in our stash and i find that thyy are some of my fvvorites . love the leg gussetts , and the ability to cusoomize th absorbancy . thyy adjutt really well and such cute patterns !	1
Love all my Thirsties products ! The liner being one part microfiber and one part hemp makes it very absorbant . And the leg elastic does n't let ANYTHING through , even on newborn babies !	1
I have 3 boys and these have n't seemed to work for any of them . The insert is n't big enough to cover all the boy parts , so they leak every single time . BUT ! ! ! I found that you can take the insert out and keep it as a doubler in another diaper . Then use the cover as a swim diaper . It 's awesome ! ! ! ! The poo does n't get stuck in the mesh like it does in a swim diaper . It wo n't leak like a swim diaper , not even for runny breast fed poo . And you get a doubler to use in another diaper . All for the same price as most swim diapers ! ! ! I have been doing it for a while now and no issues at all with delaminating , but I think if you are going to do it that you should make sure you have designated ones just for swimming just in case the chlorine does anything to the diaper .	1
I have tried a handful of & # 34 ; the best & # 34 ; cloth diapers and quickly got discouraged , as many of them did n't fit like they were supposed to on my newborn son . I ended up using prefolds , and I started using the Thirsties wraps that I had and LOVED THEM . Even on my newborn , the leg gussets contained everything , they never leaked out the front , back , sides , etc . and they instantly became the first cover I reached for.As he grew a little more , I started to using the Thirsties Duo Diaper and loved that even more . I absolutely love that the inserts are so easy to stuff into the diaper because there is an opening in the front and the back , so you can simply pull through . ( Fuzzibunz do not have this feature and I dread stuffing those pockets ) He was a larger baby at birth ( over 9 lbs ) and now is 3 weeks old . For my little chunk , I do n't see this diaper lasting as long as it says it does , but we 'll see . Either way , I 'll gladly move to size two .	1
The rose color is very pretty . I love the snaps ... easily put on . The double stuffer pad is very nice for extended diaper wear . I love that the pockets are open on both sides to allow the stuffer to aggitate itself out in the wash ... however , sometimes it does n't come out . I 'm used to bumgenius diapers ( really like them besides the one-side open pocket ) and this was very easy to use . However , due to the price ( about $ 19 each ) , I 'll be purchasing more Daiper Safari pocket diapers . They are my new favorites ( about $ 14 ) even though they come with only one stuffer . I 've got plenty of bumgenius stuffers to compensate .	1
Let me start off by saying Thirsties is one of my favorite brands . I love their snap wraps ! I could use flatfolds and prefolds with a Thirsties duo wrap exclusively , but I was looking for something with more convenience so my husband would be more apt to jump on board with cloth diapering ... you know , so he does n't have to touch the wet and dirty parts . ; ) I had a couple of BumGenius 4.0 's because I heard high reviews ( I love them , by the way ) and was going to get more , but these duo diaper snaps were on sale for $ 15 so I got one to try out.The gussets will always be my favorite feature , but there were a couple things about the duo diaper that I just did n't find that appealing.First off , the micro-fleece seems flimsy and of cheaper quality ( compared to bumgenius ) and I find myself wondering just how long they 'll last . ( Now , worst case scenario , if the micro-fleece falls apart like it feels it 's going to , I can just cut it out and use it as a duo wrap , so no huge loss . ) Second ( and last ) complaint might be a little petty but I 'll share it anyway . The way the pocket openings are put together seem sloppy , both front and back . They 're loose and you need to stuff the inner end back into the diaper before letting your little one run around . Nice idea to be able to stuff them two different ways , especially if the Little One 's in the midst of a diaper change , it 's nice to be able to empty and re-stuff from the front , plus the instructions state that because of the design , you do n't have to manually remove the insert before washing ... it supposedly comes out in the wash automatically , but I 've not tested this myself.I 'll definitely continue to go after the duo wraps , but I can do without the duo diapers . If we decide that we want more pockets , it 'll be the BumGenius brand.Update : After several weeks of use , I 've changed my opinion of these . The fabric liner is not cheap or flimsy , like I had originally believed , and the openings are n't as sloppy as first observed . The convenience of front or back-stuffing far outweighs any before-thought inconveniences . I will definitely buy these again ; I like them nearly as well as Bumgenius : whether I buy one or the other will probably depend on the prices of each at the time of purchase .	1
Pink argyle has got to be the cutest diaper pattern of all time . Beyond that , I was also really happy with the fit and experienced no leaks with this diaper . The materials have a great feel to them . We were very satisfied with this diaper .	1
First of all a few facts.Thirsties Duo Diapers ... ... .do have gussets ... .do not leak ... .do have microfiber and cotton soaker pads ... .do dry fast , as the 2 different parts of the soaker come apart in the wash ... .do not have to be separated to wash . The soaker agitates out on its own ... .really are easy to stuff ... .have really strong snaps ... .have a stay dry fabric that touches baby 's bottom , making for a very comfortable all night diaper ... .colors that are very true to the pictures on this site . And I do love the colors and prints.These diapers are absolutely awesome . I bought them ahead of time long before my son was born . He was 7 lbs 3 oz when he was born . The Thirsties Duo Diaper had a very comfortable fit , but was still slightly loose around the thighs , this caused them to leak just a little bit.By the time he was 3 weeks old , he weighed 10 lbs 2 oz . That is when I started him in these for real . They fit so well around his legs . They are not that bulky , they are extremely absorbent , and best of all they DO NOT leak ! Thirsties Duo Diapers , like the Thirsties Duo Wraps have gussets that keep even the biggest newborn explosions inside the diaper where it belongs . The diapers also do not get wet on the outside like some diapers do , even tho the pul side of the diaper is very soft and squishy.He is now 6 weeks old and slightly over 11 lbs . The diaper still fits , but is on the very last setting with both snaps on the diaper . This is the only Con this diaper has . The snaps are beside each other . This really limits the sizing in my opinion . I can see these as fitting for a little bit yet if my baby would lengthen and not get any fatter . But the problem is , my baby will get fat . All my babies are fat . They are fat , roly poly little snugglers . So I need a diaper that has a broad range of fit.If you have babies who are long and not so roly poly then this wold be ( in my opinion ) the perfect diaper for you . They are soft , cozy and very comfortable for baby . But for me , I will sadly have to trade these diapers for an option with a longer and better fit for a fat baby . These are my second favorite diaper ever.The diapers I have tried are Bumkins , Bumgenius , Fuzzibunz , Swaddlebees , Itty Bitty 's , and a few more brands that I can not remember .	1
After our daughter was born we started off with disposable diapers ! However the chemicals in the diapers were causing her to get severe diaper rash . After going through many brands , we finally decided to try cloth diapers ! After much research I decided that I really wanted to try the Thirsties ( We have the Duo Wraps for daytime with prefolds and Duo Diapers for night use and outings ) . I have to say that I am thoroughly impressed ! I absolutely LOVE these ! They are so simple to use and leaks ... .WHAT LEAKS ? Not these ! I have not had any blowouts , leak or anything ! The double gussets are marvelous and the fact that you can adjust the rise of the diaper to custom-fit your baby is what keeps them from leaking . I am completely convinced that if someone has leaks from these that they are doing something wrong with the adjustments somewhere ! It does take some getting used to as the fit of disposables and cloth diapers is definitely different but once you get the hang of it , it definitely becomes simpler ! I use these mainly at night with the duo insert that comes with it and one of the fab doublers . Every time I use these she stays dry and happy ! As for the diaper rash ? I am glad to report that it is now non-existent ! My baby girl definitely has a happy bum these days !	1
I will try to keep this short . Have tried many many types of cloth diapers ... Thirsties are my fave brand . So happy with their products and customer service . Bonus is that they 're 100 % US sourced and manufactured . All Thirsties products are hand sewn by American ladies ( located in the South I believe ) . The best kind of cottage industry , IMHO . I am a bit of a Thirsties cheerleader these days , lol . And no , I do n't work for them , just a very satisfied customer.After much experimentation I decided to go with Thirsties AIOThirsties Duo All in One Snap , Meadow , Size One ( 6-18 lbs ) for daytime and Duo Diaper SnapThirsties Duo Diaper , Mango , Size One ( 6-18 lbs ) for night , car trips or whenever baby may go an extended period of time between changes . The duo diaper has the wonderful double gusset which means there is absolutely no leakage . The insert is easy to get in and out so you do n't have to stick your hand in poo to remove it . I also love that the insert has two layers - hemp and fleece - that snap together.Thirsties Stay-Dry Duo Insert , White , Size One ( 6-18 lbs ) You can use either or both inserts depending on the level of absorbancy required . The snaps and materials are highly durable -- they still look great after daily washing for months . They fit my 6 mo old perfectly ! And not too bulky , either . Highly recommended.For an ultraslim silhouette , I prefer the Thirsties AIOs . Sadly they do not have the double gusset that I love . They are very easy on/off . There is a tunnel under the second layer of fleece , into which you could slide an additional insert . I have never tried it because I use these diapers specifically for their lack of bulk . They are great for daytime or for potty training ( because baby will be able to remove them herself by potty training age , esp if using velcro closures ) . The only downside to these is that they take a while to dry if you hang them on the line . I line dry all of my diaper covers and AIOs because I find that they get roughed up in the dryer . On a side note , I do n't buy velcro diapers anymore because I found that the velcro falls apart with repeated washing . Snaps are much better.At first I felt that it was more expensive to buy the Thirsties , because you have to get them in 2 sizes . It did n't take long to realize that `` onesize '' diapers are actually far too big for young infants and too small for toddlers of potty training age . After I brought my 6lb baby home from the hospital I discovered that NONE of the diapers we 'd bought came CLOSE to fitting her . I had to buy an emergency stash of Thirsties XS size diapers and covers . Great for petite babies and preemies ! She was able to wear the Thirsties size 1 at 8 lbs and the other brands ' one size diapers at around 14 lbs . If you have a large baby , perhaps the one size would work for you , but my small baby was n't able to use them until about 5 months old . Right now , at 15 lbs , she can fit both size 1 and size 2 of Thirsties diapers ( so double stash bonus for a little while , yay ! )	1
This has really come in handy , if she gets too fussy a little time spent rocking and she is calm . The music is an added bonus .	1
The baby is not here yet so I ca n't say if it will hold up without tipping but it is smaller than most of these types of swings which means your whole living room is not taken over by a swing . I 'm concerned that is might tip because of the way it is made but have n't used it yet .	1
My baby loves to nap in this swing ! At first , he was too small in it ( he was born 6 lbs 12 ozs ) . His head keeps dropping because it could not be properly supported , but he eventually grew into it.Pros : * The swing was perfect for my baby to sit in after each bottle feeding to avoid spit-ups ( There was still spit-ups , but not as much ) . His pediatrician recommended a bouncy seat , but this works just fine . * You could swing this 2 ways ( but you can adjust the seat in 4 directions ) . So if my son falls asleep in my arms while I was swinging side by side , I would put him in the swing and rotate the chair so it swings side by side and he could sleep in it for a long time . * The nature sounds were more like white noises . It really helps when my baby had colic , I just turned up the sound all the way and he would get quiet instantly and falls asleep to the sound of the white noise.Cons : * The sound quality is bad . I play him music on Pandora instead . * The plush seat makes my baby 's back all hot and sweaty so he could n't stay in it long during summer ( about 15 minutes and he 'll let us know to take him out ) It escalated his eczema because it was too hot . * The stars on the toy bar are sad ... You could put your own toy bar toys on there though .	1
My son wants to be held ALL THE TIME . This , of course , is impossible . Anyways , this swing made it possible for me to get things done around the house.Cool things : -It plugs in ! -You can turn the seat 360 degrees ! -The chair rocks side to side or front to back ! It always plays music and has a variety of soothing noises . It has six speeds.Oh and I am not the best when it comes to putting things together- it seriously took me less than 20 minutes and that 's with my 3 year old `` helping '' ( we all know what that means ! LOL ) .I love this swing and would totally recommend it to others .	1
We initially purchased another Graco swing for our twin boys . It fell apart , and we picked up one by another brand . Also fell apart . So when we picked the Sweet Snuggle swing up on clearance , we were n't hopeful . But this swing totally delivered on everything Graco promises to be . We have liked all our other Graco products ( save the first swing ) , and this one was no different . I 'll break it down in simple terms : PROS : easy assembly , love the six swinging speeds , adorable designs , plugs into the wall so you do n't have to use batteries unless you want to , has volume controls and lots of different songs and sound effects to use , seat turns 360 degrees to face any direction you want , five-point harness so you do n't have to worry about baby pitching himself forward , does n't cost a fortune and is well worth the money you 'll pay ... for baby 's safety and parents ' sanity ! CONS : bulky/takes up quite a bit of space , time-consuming to assemble , music/sound effects are rather low quality ( and get annoying after a while ) ADDITIONAL NOTE : When I contacted Graco about the first swing we had that was falling to pieces , they were INCREDIBLY helpful and friendly . Great customer service.I 'd definitely recommend this swing to anyone ! Will probably keep it in case we have another baby if we have room to store it !	1
This swing is neat - watch the video because it swings very differently than a typical swing . My son seems to like it ok - he 's 3 months old now and uses it a few times a week . I do wish it reclined a bit more flat for when he 's snoozing .	1
We have twins so to be without a swing would be similar to cutting off your arms and trying to care for a baby , neither one is advised ! My son totally loves this , he loves the way it swings and the different sounds . We have been using this swing for a couple months now and love it ! I would like to dispel some `` Cons '' by another reviewer . I will put their review in `` quotations '' and I will put mine after each statement in ***stars*** . `` Despite what another reviewer said , this swing does not go back and forth like traditional swing . Yes , you can adjust the way the baby faces ( up to four directions ) , but that does not change the fact that the swing moves in a side to side motion . Considering that I bought this swing thinking it could go front to back , this is a major con for us . '' ***Think about it . So it does go back & forth like a traditional swing but the seat is angled a bit different . Actually , this can face more then 4 directions because it totally rotates around in a circle . *** '' The highest speed is still incredibly slow . We 've never used the lower settings because we do n't see the point . I 'd like to have more reasonable speed options . '' ***I do agree with this , the swing is slow but not too slow , my twins still love it . *** '' The mobile bar is a bit pathetic . The two stars are velcroed on . And the bar does n't fully collapse back , making it very difficult to get your child in and out of the swing without bopping his head . The mobile bar is removable , though , so that could be an option each time . '' ***The mobile bar does collapse TOTALLY back , maybe they re-designed it ? Because mine comes off or sits all the way back , which makes it completely out of the way . No bopping heads here . *** '' The footprint is pretty big . Luckily , though , the swing radius is n't much bigger so you can set the swing in one spot and expect for it not to take up much more space . '' *** The swings radius is not any bigger then the base , we live in a 860 square foot house and there are 8 of us combined , this fits nicely in the corner or our living area without hogging up a ton of space.*** '' ... . it does n't sit flat , causing it to flap around a bit against the floor every time it swings . We 've put felt pads underneath the uneven parts to keep it steady and quiet . '' ***I too noticed this when on my hardwood floor that is not completely level . We moved and in the house we moved out of , we had carpet and we never had that problem . Felt pads took care of the problem cheap and easy for use in or new house . *** '' There is no locking feature , so when you put your baby in or go to get your baby out , the chair still has some movement , making it more difficult . I 'm sure most swings are like this but because it rocks side to side , not front to back , it 's more pronounced and frustrating . '' ***I do not notice this with my usage of the swing . ****** Everyone who comes over to visit loves the swing too ! Super easy to assemble ( my 12 year old and her 13 year old friend put it together in less then 20 minutes ! LOVE the battery OR plug in option . The only Cons for me would be that it could use a softer seat ( like some memory foam or the like ) and that the swing had an obnoxious squeak straight out of the box , I called customer service and they had me a replacement motor within days , great service ! I have had different swings for each of my 6 children and this is by FAR and ABOVE my favorite swing yet ! ***	1
My daughter hated swinging front to back so we looked around and found this swing . . After reading reviews and checking out weight charts this was the best choice . Holds up to 30 lbs and swings any way you want ! ! God send ! ! ! I am able to do dishes and laundry because toys swing is so gentle and relaxing for her . We do n't use the music on it however . . It 's kind of twangy : / but all of the good far outweighs the one complaint I have for this swing ! Super easy to put together ( coming from someone who ca n't build ANYTHING ) just love this swing all around ! !	1
I took care of a LO prior to getting PG who had a swing just like this that swung side to side . He loved it and so did I , so I knew I had to get one as soon as my LO arrived.A lot of people complain about the side to side motion that it does n't work for their LO 's but babies are in general particular about swings . I 'm lucky that my LO is n't particular and enjoys both this and a traditional swing.So far , we 've only used it in full recline . She often takes naps in it and in her first month , would really only sleep in this overnight . She loves the ocean sound and now that she 's 2 months , I 'll sometimes put the seat all the way up ( strap her in ) and let her listen to the songs , look out , and look at the toys which she enjoys.I 've had to wash the cover and also travel with this ( via car ) and it 's easy to clean and disassemble into a few main parts.Some have commented about how deep the seat is . It 's a little deep for a newborn and I have had to put blankets in the bottom to help cover the uncomfortable straps and raise her up when she was new.Great swing . ***Update*** My daughter ( 5 months old now ) does n't love this swing as much as she did when she was a newborn but it still comes in handy every now and then . I will say , this is in the same room as her crib and I use it as a noise machine at night which is a major lifesaver . I have another noise machine in my room since we were bed sharing but now it 's at my work , so being able to just turn on the noise machine is great . We 've always used the white noise which is really great . So , this item really serves a double purpose !	1
We tried and returned 2 Fisher Price swings before getting this swing . As opposed to the FP swings , the motor is practically silent , and the variable swing settings actually work . It has a pretty big footprint , but it 's a sleek looking swing that does n't look clunky . Overall , a good product . I just wish my baby enjoyed it more .	1
I talked to people and even looked it up because the amazon product page said this swing DOES NOT take a charger and was told repeatedly that it does . I even found chargers saying that they did . However , I reiterate that this swing in fact DOES NOT take the charger ! If you want a swing that uses an A/C plug in , do not get this one . This swing takes three D batteries and depending on speed and usage ( and probably size of child ) the length of their life varies greatly from what I can tell . Despite all of these , I love this swing very much as the swing adjusts to three ways from laying down to sitting up and the seat is more of a bucket seat , plenty of room for baby to sit and grow in .	1
Item arrived fast and in great condition . Easy to assemble . Lots of different sounds and speeds , although I usually have it at top speed and only use the nature sounds . I used the swing consistently until baby was about 6 months old . Batteries lasted several months .	1
I purchased this swing for my daughter who is approaching the 25lb weight limit in her Fisher Price Cradle swing . The Fisher Price swing is still my favorite , but I saw no other real option for a swing that holds more weight . My daughter is light for her age ( 20 mos ) but when she is sick , often the only way to get her to sleep and stay asleep is in her swing , thus we still use it . The Graco model is a nice swing and the way it supports underneath accommodates taller kids ( the FP one has a swing bar behind the head and my daughter 's head hits it now unfortunately ) . What I do n't like on the Graco swing is how the harness works . It 's much like her Graco high chair in that it has 5 point system - the shoulder straps ( the FP one does n't , it only has the lap harness ) and lap/crotch straps but they are awkward with a sleeping baby to get into place . The crotch strap is even more awkward to use and seems a bit short - the pad falls off constantly . If you have a choice between the Graco and the Fisher Price Cradle swing - get the Fisher Price ! The cover is also easily washable on the FP swing but on the Graco swing it was a bear just to put together and I do not look forward to eventually washing it .	1
I love this swing and so does my 10 week old son . It 's got 6 different speed settings and a bunch of different sound effects . The sounds do n't really sound like the things they are supposed to sound like , though the babbling brook one is okay . The music tracks are pretty good , though . If you read `` The Happiest Baby on the Block '' , you know that babies love the sound of white noise - so even though my husband and I do n't care for the sounds , baby does and that 's all that matters . Mere minutes after putting our son in the swing and the white noise on , he is out for 6 hours . I do wish it came with a power plug , but it has been pretty good with the batteries ( 3 D batteries required ) because we are able to set the swing to stay on for ten , twenty , or thirty minutes at a time with the timer feature . All in all , a great buy !	1
Many friends recommended this car seat and it has worked well for us . My son will outgrow it in length before he does in weight . I do n't think having a higher weight limit car seat would be helpful because the baby plus seat would be too heavy to move around anyway . This oasis pattern is a great gender-neutral choice . The blue is almost turquoise and the dots are really cheerful . Fantastic value ... did not need to spend hundreds on the seat !	1
We like the car seat so far . One complain is that it sometimes gets stuck a little when removing it from the stroller .	1
I would have given this a 4.5 if I could have . Good car seat , love the colors . The front adjustable strap is well worth a little extra ! My only complaint is that my son sweats quite a bit at times in it , particularly with the included head support . The head support also is n't very substantial but it does n't take much to switch it out for something better , especially in the newborn days .	1
We got this car seat once we realize how much of a pain it would be to use our fancier , convertible car seat ( that stays locked into the car ) . We 've very much loved having this one while the baby is so small-being able to take the car seat out so easily is wonderful and very necessary with a young baby . This is a great choice !	1
I really like this seat , it 's going to be really easy to use in car and stroller . Love the material and design and the `` sun shade '' seems like it will cover well enough to keep sun out of baby 's eyes . The head support is way too big to support a newborn head so I 'm going to have to purchase another head support until baby gets a little bigger . Overall pretty happy with purchase .	1
First off , some things : Head supports , aftermarket or stock , are not recommended in car seats so I will be removing this stock one.I would expect this one to clean up easier than the cloth one because of the fabric type , it seems much more apt to be surface cleaned while the cover is still on the car seat.Not that it was a priority , but the design is completely adorable.The car seat its self is light weight.Graco can not be beat . Shipping was fast and the price is unreal.Very excited to bring # 2 home in this !	1
We had a similar car seat for my son , but it did n't tighten in the front . I decided I did n't want to deal with that again ( so inconvenient ) , so I ordered this one and it is great . It has a lower weight limit than some of the others , but we switched my first child before the weight limit anyway because it gets awfully heavy to carry around anyway . I ca n't imagine wanting to carry a baby over 22 lbs around in one of these ! An extra base is a necessity !	1
I love Graco infant car seats . We had the Snug Ride22 for my daughter and were looking for the same seat for my twin sons . Many of the new Graco Snug Ride 22 car seats are now adjustable from the back and I do n't like that . This seat is like my old model and has the strap adjustment in the front . It makes is very easy to tighten and loosen the straps . My boys were just barely 5lbs when they came home and these seats fit them nicely .	1
My son loves this mobile . I searched high and low for a mobile that actually angles the items twoard the baby , and discovered this one . It has a ton of different songs . It makes a weird clicky noise when the animals go around , which is a little annoying , but it 's not a high quality item , so you get what you pay for .	1
My two month old son loves this ! He likes to watch the lights on the side and giggles at the animals . I like that I can continue to use it as a music box as he outgrows the mobile . I wish when it turned off the movement part would stop too .	1
This is such a cute mobile . It is well made and my baby loves watching it . This mobile has so many more songs than others we 've had in the past . The lights are just the right brightness . I also like that this turns into a radio and is able to be used as a toy after the mobile is n't needed . It easily attaches to the crib and has n't taken off paint like other mobiles in the past . I deducted one star because it does n't have an option to turn off all the lights while on . Some times at night , the music would be enough to soothe the baby and the light could be too bright . I really like the mobile overall the best compared to all others we 've had . And the price is great !	1
I scoured Amazon 's reviews to find the perfect mobile . My son loves , loves , loves this mobile . He 'talks ' to it and I love hearing him coo at it . It keeps him very entertained and I am able to do some stuff around the house and I know he is safe in his crib . He also loves to be able to kick his feet and change the music .	1
My 10 week old loves staring at this mobile , even when it 's off . It gives me the break I need to go get ready in the mornings . Other reviews sum up this product . Clacking noise does n't bother my baby . I ca n't wait to watch her use it herself when she is a little older .	1
This mobile is a great buy ! One of the best features is the 40 minutes of uninterrupted music . My son ( 10 weeks ) is absolutely fascinated by the little toys and will happily just lie on his back in the crib observing the little animals that hang from it - this was true even before I got the batteries to get the music operational . In fact , sometimes on mornings I do n't realise he is up since he 's just quietly lying in his crib staring at the mobile and laughing/cooing at the animals . The little clicking sound that the mobile makes as it goes around is hardly noticeable and certainly has n't bothered me or my son in the least . I highly recommend it .	1
LOVE this mobile ! Got this for our baby girl when she is 2.5 or 3 months old , and she has loved it since the first day . SHe 's now 4 months old . The stuffed friends are really cute , great quality , and the spinning is very noticeable . The music selection is really wonderful & # 8230 ; and there are I think 30 songs ! That makes a big difference from other mobile that only plays 4 songs & # 8230 ; The color is not as florescent pink as in the picture , which is good ! We have it on during her changing so she would stay put and not rolling over and wiggling around . We also have it on during our bedtime routine while she 's waiting for her bottle.It 's the best $ $ we have spent so far.The only thing is & # 8230 ; we could n't put it on our crib anymore , not because it did n't fit , but because it was a little too stimulating for our baby ( she gets stimulated easily and does n't sleep as well ) & # 8230 ; so we took it out of her crib and just have it near changing area on her bedroom floor .	1
Bought this 2 months ago and we still use it daily , my 5 month old loves it and yesterday he managed to change the & # 34 ; channel & # 34 ; of music all on hi own	1
Mobiles are a must have product for babies . This mobile has met all my expectations.Pros:1 . This is a major plus - The mobile is universal . You can place it in any crib style . I bought a very expensive crib with lots of intricate wood details and found that it was hard to put one of those mobiles they sell with matching bedding sets . I also use it in my cradle . Very versatile.2 . Animals are big enough for baby to pay attention . The Elephant , Giraffe and Monkey are attached to two strings and they move their heads down and up to face baby as they approach the baby while going down.3 . Lots of music and lasts longer than most . White noise did help calm crying baby.4 . Can be adjusted to different heights by adjusting the music box . This is a great feature for when baby can reach up to grab the mobile.5 . Sound level can be adjusted.6 . Night light is awesome . By the way you can turn it off , it it bothers you . There are two on features . One with night light the other one without it.8 . Baby can press on buttons to change music.Cons : I really do n't care about this one , but it does make a clacking noise . It does n't bother my girl . I did figure out why it does this . The blue disks that hold the animals shake when the animals turn . The disk has to be able to slightly turn in order to allow animals to twirl around and have heads smile at baby as it starts going down.Overall , I love the mobile . It has given me some sanity by entertaining my baby girl . Best of all she loves it . She even talks to the animals .	1
I purchased this mobile really only because I bought the Davinci mini crib , and as others mentioned on that link , this is the only mobile they have found to fit on the crib . It does have a mounting that would fit well on many crib styles . Very happy with the quality and versatility of this mobile . I have had it in my wish list for a few months and glad I finally spent the money . I do n't notice the clicking as much as others have mentioned and do n't find this affects the product . No baby yet , but I 'm sure she will love it as much as I do !	1
My baby girl loves this mobile ! She can stare at it for 30 minutes before getting bored . I love the choice of music and the volume control and blue night light for night viewing . Great product !	1
Our baby is now 5 1/2 months and he still loves this mobile . He still seems to enjoy staring at the animals and likes all of the music . I also like the music ( which is important because you hear it repeatedly ) . There is a small click when the animals rotate , but we only use this mobile for our baby when he wants to play , so that is not a problem . I would definitely get it again .	1
Assembly was easy . The speakers are of good quality so that the music does n't sound like a electronic greeting card . There is enough variety in the music that I do n't get bored listening to them . The color scheme ( blue ) is gender neutral and nicely done . Most importantly , my 6-week old loves it , and this is the first toy we got her that she actually pays attention to .	1
The first mobile I bought for my baby before she was born was a mobile that matched her bedding , as I wanted a nice looking room . Little did I know that nice looking rooms are not necessarily the most practical ones , especially when it comes to babies . She loved that first mobile , but it had to be rewinded every 3 minutes , and the least I can say is that if you can get a baby to sleep within three minutes , then you are a very lucky parent ! So I was n't going to make another mistake for the next one . I spent quite some time looking around , and actually even trying to put myself in my daughter 's place in the crib to see what she sees . And I realize that a circular movement was n't any exciting . And then one day I saw that one at my local Buy Buy Baby store . I just fell in love with the '3rd dimensional ' movement of the animals . I had a major concern : my daughter was already 3 months old and you are not supposed to let babies older than 5-6 months have a mobile , so was spending $ 50 on a mobile worth it.Well , I ended buying it and I can tell that , yes , it was and still is . Even though my daughter is older now , we found a way to elevate the mobile so that she ca n't reach it ( by attaching the mobile to the highest side of the crib ) even when she sits or stands up . She loves everything about it : the animals , the variety of music , the soothing light . She falls asleep within SECONDS with the white noise mode on . I have to agree with the reviewers that say that the music is n't exactly soothing , because they are very few of the songs apart from the white noise that would make her go to sleep . But that 's not a bad thing for us , since she is having a blast in her crib and develops her sight and sight tracking skills with it . This mobile has a double use for us : soothing with the white noise option , a toy with other modes . She especially loves the 'World Music ' mode , it is so unique and unexpected as 'baby songs ' , and yet it works ! And last but not least : you can turn it into a music box once baby is older . A excellent thing for someone who does n't like to spend money on short lived items . I recommend this mobile to every new parent , and would definitely recommend this one over the 'girlish ' design even if you have a baby girl .	1
This is my 2nd update to the review . We received a replacement mobile and after about a month it also started making a mechanical noise , but in all honesty it is still great and she does n't seem to even notice . I think we have just gotten used to it . The noise is only in the mobile unit so if you are just using the music player you will not experience it at all . All in all I would suggest it to friends and we would buy all over again.My daughter STILL loves it , but we had to send the 1st one back because the motor started making a terrible noise . We got a new one quick and with no problem but now this one is starting to do the same thing . I am so scared that we are going to have to just get rid of it ... which really sucks because there is n't anything like this ... but this ... My daughter is only 8 weeks old and she loves this mobile . I ca n't wait to see her grow and enjoy it ! I just wish we would have had one for our older son when he was a baby ... he loves it too and he is almost 4 ! Also the color shown is not the true color ( thankfully ) ... it is a much calmer shade of pink . : )	1
Really loved the concept behind this mobile and it is very cute , but I agree with other reviewers who have complained about it being noisy . The flipping noise made as the saucers turn really can get annoying from time to time . My baby does enjoy the lights and we do enjoy the 45 minute shuffled music option . All in all it 's a great mobile if you can get beyond the flipping noise , but I really wish they would redesign that aspect of this product . Because my daughter loves it so much I would say I would buy it again . She is not annoyed by the noise , like her father and I , but all babies are different .	1
Fantastic mobile . The music is so versatile : some upbeat , some calming/soothing , some white noise/background sounds . I love the & # 34 ; shuffle & # 34 ; button . I love that we 'll be able to use it for just music once my son outgrows the mobile portion . I wish there was a mode where all of the lights would turn off .	1
This was for baby # 2 so I knew exactly what I wanted in a mobile . I was very skeptical this would meet my needs but it does ! Here 's a list of what I was looking for and how this mobile fits the bill.1 . Must be automatic ! ! - With my first child , I used the one where you have to manually wind the mobile every few mins and it was a pain in the butt ! I saved all my baby stuff so I could reuse it for baby # 2 , but the manual mobile went straight into the trash ! 2 . Must be cute and not too girly looking . - I bought the blue one for my daughter and it 's very cute and not to `` boyish '' for a girl.3 . Must have bright colors - In order for you baby to be intrigued with a mobile/toy when they are a newborn , it must have bright colors.4 . Must be easily removable - The reason why this is a must is because I do n't want my baby to be overstimulated . Overstimulation makes it hard for my daughter to fall asleep because she 's too wired and her brain has a hard time shutting down . When she starts to yawn or look away after 30 to 40 mins of playing , I simply remove the pole out of the music box . It 's very easy to remove or reattach . It 's great that I do n't have to remove the whole unit.5 . Must have multiple options for sound and nightlight combination- This mobile does almost every combination you can think of . You can turn on night light , sound and rotate animals at the same time . You can turn off night light and just have sound and rotating animals . You can have nightlight and rotating animals on with no sound by just lowering the volume until it becomes mute . You can have just sound by removing the pole from the music box.6 . Must stay on for at least 20 mins - I am thrilled this stays on for 40 mins . I have n't seen any other mobile that stays on longer.7 . Must entertain my baby - My daughter is 2 months and it entertains her for at least 30 mins ! There are n't many toys that entertain her at this age but this one does ! There has been many times where she play for 40 mins and then passes out ! 8 . Must be versatile - This is my 2nd and last baby ( I think ) so I hate the thought of buying baby stuff that can only be used for a few months . Since this can be used as a music box for a toddler , I was sold . Not sure if it 's going to really be useful but hey it 's better than nothing ! 9.Must fit on my crib ! - My crib has thicker slats and I have found it hard to attach toys to it . I have no issues with this mobile . Fits like a glove and it 's very secure.There are 2 things I thought I wanted in a mobile but after using this I realized I do n't need it.1 . Since babies like toys that light up , I thought it would be a good idea to have a mobile where the animals light up . I realized during the day that function is useless and at night I want my baby to sleep not play ! 2 . I wanted a remote control but since this mobile stays on for 40 mins , I do n't need it . I thought not having one would be inconvenient but it 's not bad at all.If you 're debating between this one or the popular Fisher Price one like I did , I say go for this one ! It 's cheaper , cuter , plays music longer and it grows with your child ! You wo n't regret it ! P.S . - Only the giraffe on mine makes a clicking sound . I am not docking a star for this because the clicking is not a loud annoying click . It 's a soft click so it does n't bother me or the baby . Maybe if all 3 did it , it would be annoying.Update 10/9/13 - I still love this mobile , but I wish it had a timer for 20 , 30 or 40 mins . Sometimes 40 mins is just too long and I have to go into the room to turn it off manually .	1
I spent a lot of time researching mobiles that would be good and fit my crib . It is hard to find mobiles that fit convertible cribs , but this one does ! There is no piece on the back to hang over a rail , so you can put it in between any rails using the attachment that just screws on . On top of that , it 's a very interesting mobile ! Not only does it spin like a normal mobile , but each of the three characters spin on there own too ! Double spinning ! My baby absolutely loves it . Sometimes she even gets made if I take her away too soon . : ) It plays a wide variety of music and she just lays their cooing at the rotating animals ! She is n't old enough to play with it has a music box next , but how awesome to have a mobile that will still entertain after she is too big for mobiles !	1
My son loves to watch this mobile . Vibrant colors , lots of varying songs , and night lights make this an awesome mobile . It also can be made silent while the mobile still moves .	1
We ordered this mobile from Amazon for our 2 month old based on other reviews after our second expensive Fischer Price projector mobile died . I love the variety of songs , the soothing glow of the night light feature , the cute , colorful faces of the animals , and their unique movements . I will say , however , that when the animals spin around , the mobile makes what I consider to be a somewhat loud click sound . It bothers me , but it does n't really seem to bother our daughter . I just keep looking over at her , paranoid that the click will wake her up ( but I 've never seen any proof that it does ) . I was really surprised because none of the other reviews that I read mentioned this sound.I 'd suggest 2 improvements to this product : 1 ) Offer a setting where the music can be used without the mobile even when the mobile is attached ( you can use the mobile without the music , and you can use the music without the mobile by detaching the mobile ) , and 2 ) Somehow redesign the product to silence/eliminate the click when the animals spin . If these improvements were made , it 'd be perfect . I 'd also love a remote feature , which our defective Fischer Price mobile had , but that 'd just be icing on the cake .	1
This thing is a god send ! When it 's time for bed I can put white noise on or lullabies and between the music and calming blue night light she is out to dream land ! During the day the upbeat songs and colourful creatures really catch her Eye ! I have had this since she was 2 weeks and out has been so useful . Definitely glad I bought it for my little princess .	1
I bought this for my daughter , and first time when item arrived it was factory defect that sounds was played not clearly enough , so I returned it and got a new one after 2 days . Fast shipping , item as described . I love the quality of sound , and the colors of the toys . It has a little bit of sounds while playing but it is normal for this kinda engine inside the bar . Overall , I like it and recommend this one due to good price and quality .	1
My little girl Loves this ! She boogies to the music and watches the animals pass by , she looks absolutely fascinated . Just beware , we use it to entertain her , not go to sleep .	1
I can not say enough good things about this mobile . My daughter is just about two and still listens to the lullaby music at night/nap and then carries the radio around to play all the different songs . There is quite a variety and it 's real music .	1
This adorable mobile arrived today . It was easy to put together and our 7 week old LOVES it . He is currently grinning and cooing at the animals . The music is not terribly annoying either . Good product !	1
This is all that we expected and more , because after having the Serenade Mobile for my 16 months old twins that cost A LOT MORE than Soothe'n Groove , Thought that this one would not be as good , but I was just wrong , it is perfect and better , made of nice soft plastic and very handy , has a nice night light , can play 40 minutes of music and my 2 months old baby girl loves it ! ! Highly recommended .	1
I love this mobile . My son loves this mobile . My only issue is that even on the lowest setting , the volume of the music is ridiculously loud . When my son was an infant , I solved the problem by covering both speakers with a piece of duct tape . Now that he is sitting , I would be afraid that he 'd be able to peel the duct tape off and get himself into trouble , so I detached the upper mobile and removed the lower unit from his crib , setting it on his dresser instead . He can still listen to the music and I can feel comfortable leaving the duct tape over the speakers .	1
I got this as a gift and it was by far one of the best ones .i got . My LO loves watching it move , he was able to ( accidentally ) change the music since he was 1 month or so ... Some people mind find the tunes annoying but I do n't . My LO is 5 months and still loves it , he reaches the little animals and is entertaining , he falls asleep watching it move.It has volume control and the music can be turned off while the mobile s still on , the music goes on for quite some time without repeating . It has a light that can be turn on or off . The mobile part comes off if you want to leave only the music part attached to the crib . The mobile does make a little of abuzz sound , I contacted customer service and they sent me a new one which was silent for a few months and then started buzzing too ... It does n't bother us too much though , I still like this mobile and would recommend it .	1
This is an awesome mobile ! It definitely keeps your LO occupied . When she was an infant , she loved watching it as she lay in her crib . Now that she is getting a little older ( 1 year ) , she is standing and pushing all the buttons . Despite the fact that she has seen it for a long time now , she still enjoys it . I only put the battery in this once when I first got it , and it is still running on the same battery ! Trust me , I have used this A LOT !	1
Love this mobile . Baby 's not here yet , but this has everything . Love the detachable sound box feature is great . It 's a very cute mobile and makes a nice addition to the nursery .	1
I love this mobile , and so does my son . Great value for the money . Super easy to put together , can probably fit any crib . I would recommend it to a friend .	1
My son who is now 7 months old loves this mobile . I put him in his crib while I am putting away laundry and cleaning up and turn on this mobile . He will stare at the characters and loves the music . It has been a great hit in our family and I love that he can continue to use the music part as he grows .	1
I continue to love everything about this mobile and the company Tiny Love . This is the only mobile that I know of that plays music continuously for 40 minutes ( 40 ! ! ! ) and it 's a lovely variety too ( not just a lullaby that plays in a loop ) . The little characters are super cute , it 's not as shockingly pink as the picture portrays , and the sound of the rotating discs is n't very loud ( I 've found that if the little one is having trouble sleeping , I 'll just pull the mobile attachment off and she 'll fall asleep to the music instead . On top of that , you can travel with the music box . There 's a lot of flexibility with this product ! ) As if it could n't get any better than that , I was having a problem of the mobile hub ( the part that the hanging rotating discs are attached to ) starting to make a grinding noise , contacted the company , provided them with proof of purchase , and they immediately sent me a new part . Yes ! ! ! Great product and great customer service ! Why have n't you bought this already ?	1
I could n't make up my mind whether to buy this mobile or the Fisher Price Rainforest . I 'm glad I chose this one.It has a large selection of tunes and the baby loves pressing the huge button in the middle which changes songs . There 's a tune in the & # 34 ; world music & # 34 ; section that I myself really enjoy : - ) .The rotating animals are cute and the lights attract baby 's attention.I like that this mobile can be converted to a portable & # 34 ; boom box & # 34 ; for a toddler .	1
This is a great sippy cup for those little ones who are changing from bottle to sippy . Has a flip lip to cover .	1
My one year old son will only drink from this sippy cup . He loooves it . However , it does leak a bit and the top does n't stay on that well . Minor inconveniences for us since we only let him drink water from it anyway .	1
The SWIG has an easy to hold shape . The pivoting lid on the spout cover stays attached to the cup so it is easy to pop open and close and there are no parts being left random places or getting lost during playtime . When put to the spill test the SWIG did not make a mess , making it my favorite.I was provided a sample for the purposes of a blog review { Mom Mart } regardless all thoughts and opinions are completely my own and may differ from others .	1
The spoon has just the right size of quantity of food for baby at the first feeding stage . I started using it when my daughter was 5 months old , and now she 's almost 9 month , still works great for her . Also , the design is so cute with high quality .	1
These spoons ate fantastic ! They 're the perfect size for little mouths . The rubber side is great for scraping out the very important last bits from the bowl . I liked the spoons so much that I ordered a second set to be sure I always had one handy .	1
I love that these are dual-ended . I freeze cubes of baby food so I find the metal end is best for mixing . My LO prefers the rubber end but I 'm sure once gets teeth , we 'll switch to the metal end for her too . Super ergonomic fit in my hand and in turn perfect placement into her mouth . Feeding portion is n't too big or too small . Love the colors .	1
I really love these spoons ! They are perfect for little mouths because you can & # 34 ; scoop & # 34 ; the food into their mouths !	1
They 're silicone covered on one end making them soft . They 're very small , so they fit well in small mouths . Plus you 've got the metal side for when they get older . Just about perfect .	1
We started using these spoons with our child when she was 6 months and she is now 9 months and they are still working great.The long reach of these spoons is fantastic -- you do n't have to lean too far over to reach your child 's mouth . We typically feed our child with the rubber end and use the metal end to get the bits on her face that do n't quite make it into her mouth .	1
This are my favorite spoons ! They are long and easy to handle , they are also soft for my baby 's mouth .	1
These are really great little spoons . I used these when I introduced my son to solids and they were the perfect fit ! They hold just the right amount of food for a 6 month old and the spoon has a really good shape/depth to it . The soft side is surprisingly durable - they survived my son 's first bout with teething without a scratch . I know this sounds weird but they have a good weight to them and are a good length so it was really nice to hold.I will say though , now that my son is 10.5 months old I no longer use these spoons because they do n't hold enough food for him . So though I only used them for a short period of time , I still think they 're worth it .	1
I do research pretty much on every baby products for my son . I like the size of these scoops which are perfect for his mouth . Especially when he was learning open his mouth at the beginning of solid food introducing . This is the spoon that can goes into his little mouth without leaving mess all over his face . Well , the scoop will only hold right amount food to fit his baby mouth too.It is cool to have two different materials on one spoon . My son loves to chew the silicon end recently . He also like to feel the metal end in his mouth some times . Best baby spoon to introduce my son to solid food .	1
I love this set of spoons . These work really well and were the first spoons we used to feed solids to our baby . The shape is nice in that it holds a good amount of food but is also & # 34 ; spatula like & # 34 ; to scrape the food off the baby 's face .	1
These spoons are great . Just the right size and I especially like the silicone side for wiping across our daughter 's face to catch all the food that did n't quite make it in her mouth . It works a bit like a squeegee .	1
These spoons have been great for our daughter . We started giving her solid goods around 5 months old . These spoons are small enough to easily fit in her mouth and are more flat than others we 've seen , so easier for baby to eat off of . Highly recommend !	1
I have been using those munchkin 100 in a pack for $ 2 spoons that every grocery store sells , they are just a regular spoon in miniature . Well , as it turns out , a babys mouth is not just an adult mouth in miniature . These Boon spoons have obviously been designed from scratch . They have been made specifically for a tiny mouth that is just learning to eat & is easily distracted . The angle is comfortable so your hand does n't start to ache , the width of the spoon is tiny & the spatula type shape means you can deliver a full bite everytime . The spatula shape is also PERFECT for making sure you end p with a clean bowl ( or getting that last little bit in the jar ) & for cleaning up around their mouth during meal time . I will be investing in more of these & never looking back .	1
Great quality spoons ! I like them for when i feed baby , but I like the sassy spoons for when she tries to feed herself .	1
These are so great ! We started using them at 6 months and at 15 months I 'll still use the , even when he can definitely handle a real spoon or his oxo spoon . I love the design and the silicone side .	1
They are the perfect size for food and the handles help scoop food off . They are not heavy and he also like to bite on them which is great since he is teething .	1
these spoons are very cute , and have a silicon side and a stainless steel side for using with babies that prefer different textures . my baby does n't seem to care at all and eat from both sides .	1
The shape of the silicone end is really nice for cleaning up around baby 's mouth and getting the last little bit out of a container . It is a small spoon size , so you 'll have to go up to something larger when baby 's appetite and mouth get bigger . I kind of wish they made a bigger one .	1
These are great ! They are small enough to fit in my baby 's mouth , they hold just enough food.Normally the problem is the the & # 34 ; scoop & # 34 ; part is too deep so you have to wiggle the food off of the spoon , but these are flat enough that it can come off with just a little slide or wiping it on the top of her mouth.They look really cool too .	1
These spoons are great for starting your baby on solids . They are gentle on gums and small enough to fit into baby 's sometimes hesitant mouth . I used these exclusively for my son when he was 4 - 8 months . When he learned to take bigger bites , I transitioned him to larger spoons . The & # 34 ; hard & # 34 ; side if the spoon was never useful to me . So my advice is get these , but you will only need one pair .	1
I bought them so grandma can use for my child . I guess they are useful as I got no complains so far form her .	1
It is pricy but I like them . and my about 5 month old baby was ok with a spoon size.but once he started eating by himself they I think I need bigger and regular looking spoon .	1
Okay , that sounds like an exaggeration , but I have 4 kids spanning 16 years . Every baby spoon I have found was short handled and most had spoons that were too large and round for a baby learning to eat solids . This baby spoon is perfect , from the length of the handle down the the size of the spoon . You have to try it , you wo n't be sorry !	1
These are great spoons for little ones that are learning to self feed and works great for those who are learning to eat solids .	1
I bought these and the Dr Brown spoons . I like the Dr. Browns for not having a deep pit to collect food in but these fit in her little mouth better . She also loves to use the rubber side to massage her gums with .	1
I ca n't really compare these spoons to other products because they are the only spoons I have ever used with my son . That said , we have been using them for a couple of months now and we love them . They hold up really well even though I run them through the dishwasher almost every night . The size of the spoon is perfect for their little mouths and the length is great for feeding . Another huge reason I got these is because once our baby has teeth , I can just turn the spoon around and feed him from the non-coated side . Brilliant . I got them for a friend of mine and will definitely be getting these for other baby shower gifts . They are the only spoons to have for your baby . And they look great too !	1
I was intrigued by the glowing reviews for these spoons , which are on the pricier side . Well , they are worth it . They are awesome . They fit your baby 's mouth perfectly and create so much less mess on their face and clothing . My husband will ONLY use these to feed our 9 month old . I had to buy a second set of two so that we 'd always have some clean . We have a bunch of unused spoons from our first child ( Gerber soft-tipped infant and toddler spoons , take and toss , etc ) because we reach for these every time . They are the best for oatmeal , rice cereal and baby purees . Even the chunkier stage 2 & 3 foods work great with these .	1
Okay . I never thought I 'd find myself reviewing a spoon . But these spoons actually did make a difference when feeding my baby ; so here goes . Starting solids I tried three spoons . A little coffee spoon from my regular dishes , a Boon squirt spoon and these Boon 2 in 1 spoons . The coffee spoon is pretty good . It 's just slightly too wide for baby 's mouth . So feeding time was a little messy . But if you want to save some money , just use little cafe spoons . The Boon squirt spoon way too deep and made feeding difficult and messy . Plus the squirt dispenser is a little gimmicky and hard to clean . But these Boon 2 in 1 spoons are perfect . They actually made feeding time a lot easier and cleaner . The soft end holds the perfect bite for baby 's first solids . It 's enough of a taste for him to enjoy , but not so much it comes flowing back out . The spoons are nice and shallow , so the whole bite comes out in baby 's mouth easily . And now that he 's teething , the soft end seems nicer to chew on . I came back to buy a second set today .	1
The bowl of the spoon is deep enough to hold as big a bite of food as your baby can manage while the rubber cover protects his gums and lips . I like that the rubber runs up along the length of the spoon so that food does n't get a chance to get stuck between rubber and the metal . The length of the spoon is also great : not too short so that it 's awkward to handle and not too long that it does n't rest inside the baby food jar.And I love the colors . So glad I decided to invest in spoons that were a little pricer than some of the others available on Amazon . Figured I would be using it multiple times a day for months with at least two kids so might as well get something I 'd enjoy using everyday .	1
If you 're on the fence trying to weigh out the cost for 2 spoons ... I was too ! SO SOO glad I bought these ! They are great and gentle on baby ! Perfect shape so I do n't have to balance food to keep it on the spoon ( stage 1 foods are almost liquid . ) These are great and quality !	1
I have a difficult time feeding my baby . He did not want to do anything with spoons until I bought Boon Swap Feeding Spoon . Perfect fit not too big and no too small . I 'm extremely happy ! ! !	1
These I love ! They work wonderfully , are double sided and long enough to mix baby food without making a mess . They are cute too .	1
we started spoon feeding our bebe at four months ( when she was still pushing food out with her tongue ) , and after trying several different kinds of spoons , these are by far the best ! they are smaller than others and have a deeper bowl to the spoon , and for whatever reason it just fits in bebe 's mouth and allows her to gobble up the food a little easier .	1
These are great little spoons . I actually bought them to give medicine . All of the medicine spoons out there were huge and deep ... not good for little mouths . These work perfectly for that purpose . And I think they will be great once my son transitions to solid food .	1
Yes , this spoon is ridiculously expensive and that part sucks . However , my son opens his mouth like a little birdie- tall with a very narrow opening . This is the only spoon we can get in his mouth without a huge mess on his cheeks . The straight edged silicone tip is firm enough to efficiently wipe the messes that do get around his mouth . It far surpasses our other baby spoons for scraping.What I do n't like about this spoon ( other than price ) ? - Because the spoon is so narrow , it 's difficult to get much food on it- especially runnier foods like pure fruit purees . By adding some oatmeal or cereal we can thicken it up enough to work ( although we do that anyway to avoid prune or mango induced explosions ! ) . However , this means than for anything but the thickest purees it takes much longer to feed than the standard wide spoons.What I 'm ambivalent about : - The double ended spoon . I do n't feel like its really necessary- especially with one silicone , one metal . I typically use metal end to scoop in cereal/oatmeal , and feed with the silicone end . I wish it were one solid surface for cleaning purposes- you can lift up the silicone edge slightly which means food can squeeze in there too.Our son is almost a year old and has been using these spoons since about 8.5 months . We also have the hard plastic Munchkin spoons ( hate them- very long with overly deep spoon bowls and way too wide ) and the silicone `` love '' spoons by Munchkin ( like these , but they 're a little too wide ... At some point I expect to transition to these from the narrow Boon spoons since they hold more food and hopefully my son 's mouth will eventually get a little wider '' ) .Overall I highly recommend these spoons for narrow birdie mouths , but I would choose the 2 pack Muchkin silicone `` love '' spoons for wider mouths in order to feed more efficiently .	1
I needed a spoon for a little mouth and these are great ! The other baby spoons we were using ( cant remember the brand ) were too wide for our little guy 's mouth . Now that we own these though , I love them for more reasons . Firstly the soft tip side is great for his gums but the hard side is GREAT for scraping food off his face . They also scoop food out of jars and bowls nicely . As an added bonus I think they look really nice .	1
I have some of the regular munchkin or whatever type , and they 're OK . But these spoons do an amazing job of making sure the food gets in my daughter 's mouth , not the rest of her face ( or lap ) . The size and shape are perfect for her mouth and for getting all the food out of containers and the weight is perfect for sitting in dishes without flipping over . I would highly recommend paying the price for them !	1
I use the silicon end for most foods and the stainless steel end to scrape bananas and avocados into puree at the table . Have seen a bit of discoloration after using with carrots and sweet potatoes , but not enough to bother me . Prefer these to plastic spoons . Would definitely recommend .	1
Nice set of spoons maybe too small though ... . Thy might have been good for the very beginning . Not comfortable to hold as you have to hold the metal part . I prefer my Bambu baby spoons .	1
I bought these after buying the multi-pack of Munchkins spoons with heat sensing tips because after just using those one time , I realized they were completely worthless . Sure the Boon spoons cost more ( you get half the number of spoons for double the price ) but these are truly excellent . The spoon picks up just the right amount of food -- not too deep or shallow . The perfect size for baby 's little mouth so that you can get the food all the way in because when you ca n't deliver the food towards the back of the mouth , especially when babies are still learning how to swallow , you will end up wasting all the food and your effort as the natural reflex of the baby 's mouth and tongue will just push the food out of the mouth and it gets all over the baby 's face . These are double ended so you can choose which side works best for you . There is a stainless side and a soft silicone side . When you 're new to feeding and afraid to hurt your baby 's delicate gums the soft side really helps you practice feeding your baby without fear . I find that the silicone side also works great as a scraper to get all the food off from around the mouth as well . Like a quality silicone spatula . Perfectly angled , good weight , and length of spoon is easy on hands . Gives you great dexterity to work around the small mouth of baby . Keeping the mess to a minimum . And your baby actually eats more food , more efficiently.The Munchkin spoons lacked all the good things about these spoons . They are just left in the drawer unused . I only reach for the Boon spoons now and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a good utensil . Having the right tool for the job really makes a difference .	1
These spoons are great ! They are so comfortable to feed our daughter with ( 6mo ) and the size of the spoon is great . We currently are using the silicone end so it 's comfortable on her gums . They wash up well and look great as well . Would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for spoons to begin feeding their little one with .	1
I like these spoons . The only thing you need to know is that they can hold very little liquid foods , too little in my opinion . But perfect for purees that you do n't add liquids to .	1
These are a great shape and are very handy . They have worked very well when introducing my son to purees .	1
My daughter did so well with these her first time eating ! I remember my first daughter pushing food out with her tongue and generally having a hard time with her first attempt at eating on a normal baby spoon . Not so with these ! My youngest was slurping the food right down like she 'd been doing it for months ! It fits in the mouth nicely as it 's not really wider than a nipple and allows them to sort of suck the food off . It 's also soft and shapped for easily 'scraping ' any lost food off the chin . Highly recommend !	1
These are fantastic spoons and I wish I had discovered them sooner . The spoon provides just the right amount of food for a beginning eater and the scoop is just the right depth & size to allow for little mouths being able to get everything off of it - my little one was having a hard time getting all the food off of other spoons . My baby is 7 months old and very much enjoys eating from this spoon . The rubber coating is durable and thick enough to be soft on baby gums . These spoons are also very comfortable , seems almost ergonomically designed for the person holding the spoon/feeding the baby . The only draw back that I can think of is the price -yes these are more expensive than I would normally pay for a product like this , but I am very glad that I listened to other reviewers who were also very happy with this purchase -- it is worth it .	1
I bought these as I was looking for a stainless steel spoon without plastic . I love that you can use either end of this spoon . Thus far I have only used the metal side . The spoon is big enough to hold a small amount of food but is n't too big for my son 's mouth . I would highly recommend this product as a baby 's first spoon . Easy to clean and well made .	1
These spoons work great . We 've been using them since our son was 6 months old . The size is great for his mouth . I will say , although I 've tried to use both sides in the same sitting ( one to feed him , one to scrape the sides ) , that just ends up being messy , so there 's not really a need for both sides , but we still really like them .	1
These are the perfect size for my son 's mouth . We started using these when he was 6 months old for his first foods and it 's great ! We still use them for him ( he 's now 14 months old ) .I 've only used the rubber side for feeding and use the metal side for mixing ( like oatmeal ) .	1
This is the 4th tub we have purchased over the years to bathe a newborn baby in . And it is the best . We had the Eurotub but it was too deep and uncomfortable . We had the sink Pujtub which is a great concept but hard to use in some sinks . We also had a regular tub which is again too deep . The Boon Naked tub is great because you can adjust its depth and it also angles for bathing newborn babies . Finally a tub that actually does what it 's meant to.Update : After using this product for several months , I realized it has one big flaw . The legs are n't too tall so the base of the tub with the water drainage hole touches the bottom of the bathtub and so the soapy water does n't drain well and the tub fills as I try to give my baby a bath . Every minute or so I have to lift my baby and turn the tub upside down to empty it . Otherwise , the design of it and how it folds flat and hangs with a hook to dry is great . Too bad because otherwise I loved this tub .	1
I bought the Euro bath first and I just do n't have the space for it right now ( I do like it a lot though , great support for newborns - just wish they had a texture to it so that the baby wo n't slide down , so use a towel under baby ) . Easy to use and clean .	1
We were in need of a tub that could collapse . We have one small bathroom and a kitchen that is n't big enough for a bathtub . I ordered two different tubs before this one- all too big and finally decided to spend the money on the Boon . It is still quite large , but it collapses so we can store it over the tub on a hook . There is nothing fancy about it- no temperature , no toys , etc , but it seems to work so far . We have only used it once with our 3 week old and bathing is still a two person job ! We also bought the infant bath sponge which I think is necessary so baby has something soft to lie on .	1
I have been using this bathtub for the past 3 months . My son was under 5 lbs . and 17 in . when we brought him home and we felt safe bathing him in this tub . At first both of us would bathe him with one holding him up and the other washing him , mostly due to us being new parents . I have given him several baths alone without issue . The tub is secure if you use the lock . I use this bath on our kitchen counter and have no concerns regarding its safety with proper use . I love that it is collapsible .	1
We are very happy with the tub . Works great , looks sleek and folds up small for storage . Plus BPA , PVC and phthalate free ... one of the only tubs I 've found like that . A lot of people say the bottom is too slick , but if you do n't fill it too high with water the baby wo n't go underneath it . You can buy a little bath sponge to put on the bottom if you really want . Otherwise I really like it .	1
This bath is very easy to store as it folds down to a nice size . Easy to use . However , even with the safety bar on the bottom in place as per instructions to hold the basin on an incline for an infant , it still fell down while bathing . Good product overall and much easier than a bulky tub .	1
This tub was perfect for us after our daughter outgrew the sink , yet was n't big enough to sit in the tub . We put the whole thing in the tub or used it on the floor ( though that was obviously messier ) . I absolutely loved how it folded up and could hang on the bathroom door , as we are short on space . The only complaint is that the bottom is pretty slick . We had to sit/lay our daughter on a washcloth to make her a bit more secure .	1
I purchased this tub as a replacement for a foam pad that mildewed after just four baths ! We are very happy with this purchase . It does n't smell like plastic like some tubs do , collapses down flat enough to hang it on the back of our bathroom door after it has dried , and it 's certainly worth the extra money ! For newborns , I suggest placing a hand towel under their head so they do n't slide down with the tub at an angle . We 'll be using this for years to come ! Buy this tub ! ! !	1
Our bathroom is small . I needed something that was easy to clean but easy to store . This does both . I used it flat ( collapsed ) with a towel underneath my baby when my baby was a newborn and only needed a sponge bath . When he needed his first bath , I kept the towel there but filled it with a little water ( this helped keep him warm and also kept him feeling familiar ) . When he got a little bigger , we used the incline ( here is the tricky part - there is a locking latch and you need to verify that it is secure and clicks in place because if you do n't hear the click , it is n't locked in place ) . The is roundish so you ca n't just assume your baby wo n't move or wiggle around . There is n't a locking mechanism that keeps your baby anchored in place . ( I looked at those contoured tubs and it seems like a pain to clean and a pain to deal with when you baby is older and wants to move around . ) So do n't put too much water in ( just enough to soap your baby up ) . There is a lovely plug that you can then lift and it keeps the water nice and low as you rinse your baby.Now that my baby is six months and sitting up , I use this both at an incline and in its regular non-collapsed state . Again , I do n't fill it up with water , but he loves the feeling of `` deepness '' and being able to hold on to the sides . Once we 're done , I drain it and hang it to dry.The tub is easy to clean . I used a green cleaner and give it a gentle scrub and then a thorough rinse.I would recommend this to others but just be aware that the shape does not hold your baby in place . You should always have a hand on your baby anyway .	1
This tub is great . It can be propped up when the little one still needs support and can be laid flat when they are a bit bigger . The drain hole allows water to run out if you want to keep fresh warm water inside . It folds up and stores up nicely .	1
This is a fantastic tub . I did n't want one of those huge plastic tubs to deal with so was excited to find ths collapsable tub . We did pair it with a sponge for our newborn which works well . It is easy to setup , clean and restore . I appreciate that because of the clever design , it will accommodate our baby for a very long time.Contrary to some of the other reviews , I found the materials and construction to be very high quality . If you follow the instructions , there should be no way that the bottom would pop down .	1
i got this before my baby was born because i loved the way it looked , it seemed like it would function just as we needed it to and it folded up when not in use.i have loved this tub since the first time i used it . it felt really secure with my newborn in it . i did lay a little washcloth down before setting her in it to keep her from slipping but i would have done that regardless of which tub i used.she 's 16 months old now and i still use it ! it 's the perfect size and it 's really easy to rinse out & # 8211 ; no little crevices for hard water to build up in.it looks cool and modern , which i like & # 8211 ; i can fold it up and it hangs right off the towel rack in the bathroom.i would highly recommend this to anyone wanting a nice looking baby tub !	1
I won this as a prize from a local baby boutique and it has completely replaced the other infant bathtub we had been using . It is just deep enough , and just long enough , to fully bathe baby without wasting water ( our other baby tub is so long you could really fit two kids in it , and it takes a lot of water to get any kind of depth in it ) . We received it when she was about 5 months old and could sit unassisted , so we have not used the newborn setting . However , the legs have always seemed firmly situated and very stable . The legs also lock into the standing position , as an added safety measure . The only thing worth considering is that , because there is no support in the base of the tub , if baby grabs the side and tries to make a run for it , she may slip . But this is why babies do n't bathe unattended ! The design is awesome . The drain is very close to the center , a common sense measure most designers fail to implement . This helps the tub drain quickly and evenly , and we can hang it to try from the shower head almost immediately . When it 's dry we just hang it on a hook on the back of the bathroom door . Our bathroom is tiny and we do n't have room for lots of baby accessories in there , and this tub is a perfect fit . It would easily fit , say , behind the toilet if we were even more cramped for space .	1
I love the recline feature on this bathtub . It allows baby to be in a cradled upright position that makes interacting with baby easy and enjoyable for everyone . This makes bonding with baby during bath-time a breeze.This is a bathtub that will grow with your child . The recline feature is great for bathing a baby and gives me a sense of security when bathing my baby who can not yet sit upright unassisted . But that is not the end of it ; the NAKED baby bathtub can also expand and be used as a small bathtub for babies who can sit upright as well as toddlers.Boon Inc. solved the dilemma of where to store the baby bathtub when it is not in use . This bathtub collapses into itself creating a nice flat product that can be slid under a crib or hung up on the back of a door or a towel bar until it is needed again.I am a fan of the sleek modern design . I think this is a very good looking baby bathtub , and I do n't mind looking at it hanging up in my bathroom when it is not being used . I love the bright green color and the fact that it is smooth and easy to clean.I was given a sample for the purposes of a blog review ( Mom Mart ) , regardless all opinions are my own .	1
We purchased this bathtub after trying the Safety 1st Turtle Complete Bath Center ( the middle plastic part where the two parts of the bathtub meet sticks up and out and hurt our baby 's back and should honestly be recalled ) and the Prince Lionheart Flexibath Foldable Bathtub ( its great that it folds , but its not big enough-very deep but not long enough ) . Well , three times the charm ... the Boon Naked bathtub is a sleek , modern design that conveniently folds up for storage ... its very smooth ( nothing sticks out to hurt our baby ) and its plenty roomy to grow with her . We love it ! Only thing is that it is a little slippery ( even in the tilted newborn position ) so we just temporarily put a folded handtowel in there for now and that fully supports our baby from slipping . We plan on purchasing some stickies for the bottom of the tub to make it less slippery . Nonetheless , absolutely wonderful bathtub !	1
This tub is the very best newborn tub . It is easy to use and safe . The only downside is the price .	1
I really love the look of this tub and the reasonable price for the great quality . I appreciate that it is collapsable and that there are the two settings with or with out incline depending on the child 's age . Smiles ...	1
This is the tub that solved our bathing dilemma . My baby is now 8 months old , but she is quite little and was not sitting on her own when we purchased this product . It has finally made bath time fun and safe for me and my child . I had kind of a Goldilocks experience with various bathtubs - tried the collapsable foam bath , but it was too small to use for very long , did n't fit in any of our sinks and eventually the soft foam literally ripped apart . Then we tried the popular Primo - it was too big , awkward , a huge pain to store in our small apartment , and so deep that my infant would just float off to the side of the infant seat . Then we tried a bath seat , which necessitated filling the whole bathtub , and did n't have any features to hold my child in place so I had to keep a hand on her all the time , which hurt my back and usually meant I would just give up and get in the bath with her . Finally we took a chance and invested in this tub , and it is fabulous . Its smallish in circumference which makes my baby feel safe and contained - she can grip the sides if she wants , and and I can fill it very quickly . Its deep enough so the water covers her legs and belly , but base of the tub is rounded and smaller than the upper rim so she never gets fully submerged , even if she scrunches her legs down , rolls , or loses her sitting balance . We still use the reclining position and have never had a problem with the prop collapsing - you just have to make sure the prop is correctly positioned in the slot before you fill it with water and put your baby in the tub , as per the directions . After the bath , it collapses to flat and we hang it from our towel rack . Best of all , it is the first time my baby has truly loved her bath . She used to be nervous and skittish in the water , but in this tub she can sit , recline , splash , and kick , without fear . I agree with some of the other posters that this tub does not have enough support for a floppy newborn - I would probably get an additional bath cushion for a newborn . However , it is perfect for my slightly older infant , and I anticipate using it for at least another year .	1
It 's a cute duck , but definitely wo n't be confused with the classic yellow rubber ducky . I got it because our daughter was ready for some bath toys and I wanted ones that were free of BPA , phthalates , and would n't collect water . This fit the bill . The little one definitely enjoys chewing on it during her bath . It 's completely sealed , so no worries about water collecting inside and molding . The plastic is very stiff due to the lack of phthalates and seems to be an appealing texture for chewing . It does tend to capsize easily and spends most of its float time upside down , but the little one is n't bothered by this one bit . Husband is still wanting to get her the classic rubber duck , but we 've agreed to stick with this one until she 's out of the phase where everything she can get her hands on becomes a chew toy .	1
No water gets in this duck , yay ! He 's weighted so he leans a little forward in the bath , but the Little likes him just fine and he 's great to chew on . I was a bit surprised at how small he is , he sits comfortably in an adult 's palm . We 'll just have to get him a friend !	1
Rubber ducks with squirt holes in the bottom are cesspools for bacteria , mold and who knows what else . I would not want my child playing with or chewing on a toy that has captured old nasty bath water . The only way to fix that problem is by bleaching the rubber ducks or buy Boon Ducks ! They still float and they are way more durable then a typical rubber duck . They are BPA & PVC free which makes me very happy to know and they make my kids smile . Job well done .	1
Love the Boon ducks ! So glad to have found some duckies that do n't have the squeezy hole in them to collect moldy water . We 've got two & my 21 month old loves em .	1
Grandaughters favorite color is purple and ... out went the traditional yellow duck . Some in reviews complained about odors but I found no unusual odor whatsoever !	1
Love this duck . My 6 month old loves it as well . The duck floats great and does not tip . Spins funny when under the running water , which is fun to watch . No water gets inside so no fear of mold collecting in the toy . We got the purple and the yellow ducks and glad with the purchase ?	1
I recently ordered and received this stroller form Amazon.I did n't test it in the real world with 2 kids yet , but I wanted to share my first impression about this stroller . I will update this review based on the `` field '' use soon.Little background : I like Graco products overall . I 've been using Metrolite Graco stroller for over 3 years now and still happy with it . No problem what so ever ! I never own another double stroller - only tested few in the store or chat with some friends who have other brand double strollers , and hated all available sit and stand models ... all looked huge ! It took me 15 minutes to put this stroller together out of the box . The hardest part was to insert pins in the wheels . Other than that all directions were clear and easy to follow.First impression - it 's HUGE ! ! ! [ Remember I mentioned I never had double stroller before ? ] The underneath basket looks large enough for diaper back . It 's possible to access it from the side , but I do n't think it will be easy to fully use it from the side only - just to get something from the bag or drop something in the basket.It feels very nice to push it . Very smooth stroller ( at home and at the paved sidewalk outside ) . It has very nice and deep 2 cup holders and another place to store keys or cell phone at parent 's tray . Child 's tray is nice too . It 's a little higher compare to Metrolite stroller level wise , so I think it might be uncomfortable to use for the younger children.What I absolutely love about this stroller is the way it folds ! It 's truly a one hand fold ( keep in mind it lays flat on the ground after you fold it ) . It does n't stand by itself , but I do n't really care about it . It 's heavier compare to Metrolite ( of course and there is nothing wrong with this ) , but when it 's folded , it takes nearly the same space as Metrolite ! Amazing ! I have never though double stroller could be folded to THAT size ! I took a picture comparing this stroller with Metrolite , so I am adding them to Amazon.What I do n't like about this stroller so far is the front seat . I think it 's more for toddlers than for infants . It does n't look comfortable for some reason and as I already mentioned before , the tray is at a relatively high lever . After reading other reviews I was worried about flat position of the front seat - I was under impression it will not be flat enough for a baby to sleep comfortably there when reclined . I was wrong . Even though it 's not completely flat , it 's very similar to the seat Metrolite has . When it 's fully reclined , older child will not be able to seat on back seat.As for the seat for the older child - it has little padding and the belt . There is a nice size step for the child . I love to be able to walk without hitting this step ! Overall I am very impressed with the initial quality and the stroller itself for the money I spend . I will update my review after a real `` test drive '' aka Disney trip with 2 kids : ) UPDATE : After using this stroller for one of our Disney trips I have something else to add to my review ... First , let me tell you I had two 3 year olds with me and they were happy to have a stroller ! It was a little hard to push the stroller with two little ones ( 30 lbs each ) . Also , I had a feeling the stroller always tried to roll to the right , so I kind of had to push it towards left side.The bascket underneath is great - very roomy and easy to access from a side . The only problem is that it can not hold anything more or less heavy . We had 4 bottles of water ( 0.5L ) and the bascket was pretty much to the ground . I also had to watch nothing will fell out from the side.I love that parents tray as well as child 's tray both have deep cup holders.Even though I have nothing to compare this stroller to I still happy with my purchase . Renting double stroller at the Disney for 3 days cost the same as to buy this one from Amazon !	1
I bought this tandem shortly after my daughter was born when I discovered she would n't be safe sitting next to my son in a side-by-side stroller ( we had a combi and he liked to hit/smoosh her ) . We 've had it for 3 years . I have the version pictured in the product description , with the large plastic pieces on the sides . I like this stroller , but I just replaced it for a double jogger ( for reasons listed below ) . Here 's the good and bad things I 've noticed about this stroller : Cons : -The biggest con for me is that the front seat leans back too far over the back seat . The kid sitting in the back constantly has the front seat jabbing them in the back . This causes fighting and makes neither of my kids ( DS5 and DD3 ) want to sit back there . Also , there 's no way my son could sit in the back if I had the seat reclined for my daughter to nap . Two sleepy kids would be out of luck.-This thing can be a serious load to push and can be hard to turn . That 's pretty standard for a tandem stroller , and from what I 've heard this one is better than others on the market . I 've pushed it loaded with both kids ( about 80lbs ) and all our gear around the zoo all day and been ok , but it might be difficult for others.-The basket underneath is a bit hard to access . The only way to get to it is from the side . You have to have two free hands to do it , otherwise you 'll be crouched down there sweating forever.-The sun shade only covers the front of the stroller . The kid in the back needs sunglasses and extra spf , no way around it . It also moves very easily , allowing my kids to adjust it ( translation : whack each other ) on their own.Now the good : -The parent tray on this stroller rocks . The cupholders are nice and deep . I think I 've only ever spilled one drink while using this stroller . There 's also a spot in between the cupholders for your phone , keys , napkins , a sippy cup..whatever.-While the basket underneath is hard to get to , it holds a lot . I can fit three or four bags under there.-I do n't know what the listed weight limit is , but I 've actually had three kids at a time smash onto this stroller ( at the zoo ) and I was still able to push it ( with considerable effort ) .-The snack tray on the front holds snacks/drinks and the cup holders are deep enough that they do n't fall out.-This stroller folds up and unfolds easily . When folded it is about the size of a single travel system stroller . It fits in the trunk of my VW passat with room to spare.Just a few more notes . There is no cupholder for the backseat of this stroller , so I bought a BRICA deluxe snack pod stroller drink and snack holder and attached it to the back of the stroller on the side . It works awesome.I tried buying a joovy too rear seat and attaching it to this stroller , but it did n't fit . Graco should consider making a similar product.We are preparing for a trip to Disney , and that is what prompted me to purchase a double ( side by side ) jogging stroller ( I got the BabyTrend expedition double ) to replace this one . The sun shade and uncomfortable back seat plus hefty pushing requirement ruled this stroller out.If I had it to do over , instead of buying the combi double stroller and this stroller and now the double jogger , I would have just purchased a city mini GT double . Even though it 's pricey , it would have been cheaper than these three strollers and would have served all of my needs and my kids would still fit in it.I like this stroller , it worked ok for us , but it does n't make me 100 % happy .	1
Great stroller . We have owned 4 other strollers ( single Graco , Duoglider , Contours , and a Combi side by side ) and this is one of our favorites . We purchased this for our 17 month old and 3 1/2 yr old . They love it and my husband and I love the compact size and the cup holders . I debated about getting the Joovy or Baby Trend but we liked our previous Graco strollers and this one is lightweight , has an adult cup holder , great storage basket , and is inexpensive . We are very pleased with our purchase .	1
I was torn between a few different sit and stand style strollers ... . I have a 4 year old and a newborn on the way . While my son can walk he 's a wild child and the thought of both kids at a store scared me not to mention trips such as to the zoo . I thought this would be perfect.My sons verdict : He loves that he has a big boy seat and the baby has a baby seat . He seems comfortable and likes options.My verdict : I like that this has one of the highest weight limits ( I believe it 's 50 pounds each seat ) whereas most cap at 40.I also found it fairly simple to assemble . Mainly attach wheels , shade and trays . Wheels took me a while though . I believe this is user error though.Size ... .it folds small . It fit better than the travel system stroller in to my trunk ( I have a Dodge Stratus so not a huge trunk ) . It is taller/thicker but not as long so it 's easier to fit in . You do n't have to keep wiggling it in/out like I did with our full size single stroller.Pushability : It has a nice smooth ride ... it 's easy to push . It is long but it fits 2 kids so expected that . I really like pushing it overall though.Quality : I feel it 's a good quality , seems sturdy and well made.Basket : is nice and big . It 's hard to get stuff through middle because it 's between seats BUT the sides are elastic and you can get it in through that way . It 's a quality material too . My 4 year old proudly announced `` I 'm in here '' and i looked and he was some how sitting in the basket part and it did not break/rip.Cons : We got a Graco Snugride car seat and it 's kind of a pita to get in . I thought it would just snap and go but you snap then have to wrap the seat belts from stroller around sides of car seat ... this really is my fault for not looking up how it hooks up first . Once you figure it out it is n't that bad either.With infant car seat it takes a little space away from back seat but not too much . My son did n't seem to mind.overall we are very happy with purchase and it makes for a great stroller .	1
We took this on a cross country train ride . Folded up small , which was great . I do wish the carseat fit in the stand section so when the toddler is tired they both could sleep . We ended up putting the toddler in the infant seat to sleep and wrapping the baby to me while we toured Chicago !	1
This is my second sit and stand type stroller . The first one I had was a Baby Trend . I bought both strollers new . The Graco is nicer by far . If you are trying to decide between the Baby Trend sit 'n stand and Graco 's room for 2 stand and ride , then buy the Graco . The quality is far superior . The Graco holds two fifty pound kids . Yes , it is heavier than the Baby Trend , but the quality is so worth it . It folds up nicely and weighs much less than my tandem double stroller . Thank you Graco ! !	1
We bought a Graco travel system with our first baby , so we had a big , bulky stroller that was only good for one child . Now that we have a 2 year old and an infant , I had no way of taking them both out for a walk by myself . This thing has saved the day ! It 's long but does n't feel bulky , has more metal parts than our travel system stroller so it seems more well-built , and it folds up more easily for storage . Our baby carrier snaps onto the tray just like with our travel system stroller , and now the 2 year old can sit ( or stand ) in the back by me . Her head seems to be a bit close to the foot of the baby carrier when everyone 's strapped in , but she does n't seem to mind . The removable canopy is a little jerky to adjust , but when you use it with the shade on your baby carrier , it works great . Those who say it 's useless must not have their carrier shade attached . Much more useful cupholders/general stuff tray than the travel system stroller , too.I do n't think the retail price is bad , but if you can get it on sale , this stroller is awesome .	1
We are expecting our first child in July , so the timing was perfect for us to try this stroller . It is considerably heavier ( almost 10 lbs ) than the stroller we were originally looking at , but that is to be expected since it is built to hold two children.My husband is a handy guy and was able to assemble the stroller fairly easily . There were a couple of points where he was a little confused but he was able to figure it out quickly.The stroller is very easy to open and close , once you get the feel for it you can perform this function with one hand . The features are very intuitive it is easy to turn and maneuver . It is , however , quite large even in the folded position . It takes a little work to get it in the almost non-existent trunk of my Mini Cooper.I would caution two things , and they not so much negatives as just something to keep in mind . The product images show the older child standing in the stroller facing the parent , where the manual clearly states that children should be facing forward when standing while holding onto the stroller frame to avoid falling . This position seems like it would be a little awkward , but I guess the child always has the option of sitting if they prefer . Also , the product description says that the stroller `` Accepts all Graco infant car seats '' but the manual states that only a Graco SnugRide , SnugRide 30 , SnugRide 32 , SnugRide 35 or Infant SafeSeat car seat is compatible . Granted , this is the vast , vast majority of infant car seats sold by Graco , but it is not all inclusive . It may perhaps go without saying , but also no Graco Convertible car seats will work with this stroller .	1
I like this stroller , it serves the purpose of getting my kids from A to B . This is actually my secondary stroller because I have a massive double jogger and I wanted something lightweight and smaller that we could use if needed . Overall , I think it is made well and it 's worth the money . The only thing that I do n't like about it is that when I have the carseat in the front my older daughter ca n't sit back on the sit and stand portion because the carseat is hitting her in the back of the head . If she sits on the edge of the & # 34 ; bench & # 34 ; it is fine but I always feel bad because she ca n't sit all the way back .	1
I wish someone had told me sooner about this stroller with the birth of our second child - we initially registered and acquired a much bulkier Chicco double stroller that was just a huge pain to get in/out of the car and even more difficult to move around because of its length . We ended up selling that one and buying this one , which was much more affordable and actually quite sturdy considering how many times we 've already used it . The front seat reclines a bit ( but keep in mind when reclined there is no space for the child in the back to sit - I suppose you ca n't have everything and it is a fair trade off to have a more compact stroller ) . It is very easy to get my younger 14 month old daughter into the seat ( just push a button on the tray on one side and lift and it clicks back in place when baby is strapped in ) . And my son who is 3 years old likes to sit in the back seat and occasionally stand on it when he does n't feel like sitting . This is especially useful since he goes through moods where he wants to sit and sometimes he just does n't want to be strapped in and wants to walk around . The stroller itself is very easy to turn/maneuver . The canopy on the front is not so huge but it does the job , and you can easily move it forwards/backwards to cover your child appropriately . The cup holders are a good size , they hold most standard soft drinks and cups unlike some other strollers that have impossibly small ones that only hold small water bottles . There is also a center console to put your phone in . Opening/closing the stroller is a snap and very easy to fold . Another plus is that it is not impossibly heavy to get in/out of your car . There are brakes on the back wheels that occasionally my son plays with but it 's not a huge problem . Customer service is also great , we had an issue with the opening/closing mechanism of our stroller and they immediately resolved the problem and were very kind on the phone . Overall when I think about how much was spent on our first double stroller , I kind of feel sick knowing how much better this one is , and at half the price .	1
This is a very convenient and fairly well made stroller for two kids ( a baby and a toddler ) . It is easy to assemble , relatively sturdy , and fairly maneuverable . There is enough room for two kids , but the older one should not be older than about three years . It also comes with a lot of storage space , for all your kid handling needs . It collapses into a compact shape that can easily be stored and taken on trips . However , it still comes with a few shortcomings . The storage space under the seat is not very accessible . The cover for the front seat is stiff and not easily adjustable . When you collapse the stroller it collapses to the ground , instead into an upright position.Overall , I think that this is a pretty decent two-kid stroller that will fit most parents needs .	1
I would really like to rate this higher but our older child is not comfortable in the rear location . With the front seat area in full recline he pretty much has to stand up or the front seat shade hits him in the back . The storage is also rather small and it 's hard to get anything in or out ( it holds our mail on the way back from the mailbox but not much more ) . That said , we purchased this because it would accept our Snugride 35 and it does a great job of that . Hopefully our older son will adapt to the slightly uncomfortable confines of the second seat .	1
My husband says I hoard strollers . Truth is , it took me too many tries to find one that works for me . I loves my graco duoglide , but it was time for something smaller since my kids were getting bigger . ( 15 mo and 3 years ) The older one wants to walk most of the time , but gets tired so still needs a seat . I love how light this is . It folds down as small ( if not smaller and lighter ) then my metrolite-which I also love ! ) So here are a few pros and cons from someone who has been through ALOT of strollers : Pro : LightweightEasy to maneuverFits easily through doors and most aisles at storesParent tray holds everything I needBoth seats are easy to get into and out ofFront snack tray opens easily- allowing front rider to get in and out by themselves ! Easy to foldFolds smaller than most double strollersCons : The storage bag is hard to get to ( like others have said ) - but doable*I also hang my diaper bag on the handle instead of putting it in the storage bag . My oldest just ducks under to get in*While the sun shade is adequate , I do not like the fact that there is no where for it to go when folded.Like others , the front seat is slightly reclined even at the most upright . I have n't had a problem with it , but others might.good luck	1
My 3.5 year old has outgrown the double stroller he and his younger sister shared . It was a Graco DuoGlider and while a bit bulky it did the job well , but it became increasingly more difficult for him to get into and out of . Before that we had a single Jeep stroller and before that we owned a single Evenflo stroller . This combines all the best features from all of them and is really a delight to use.Pros : - The seats are weighted to hold 50 pounds each . That 's the largest rated amount I was able to find in a sit and stand type stroller . It should be able to last for quite a while if I needed it to.- It 's easy to get in and out of for both the back and front seat.- Large basket for several jackets , water bottles and other similar items.- It 's one hand collapsible with a latch on the side.- Both seats have belts , though I do n't use it on my 3.5 year old . He 's pretty good about staying put and enjoying the ride.- Lightweight at 29 pounds , compared to a double . Comparatively my son weighs 30 pounds , so it 's the same as lifting him.- When it 's folded up , it 's smaller than the size of the single stroller we had . No problem fitting it into the trunk.- Here 's the best part , it 's incredibly easy to maneuver . With both kids in it and even things in the basket below , it still manages to turn on a dime.Cons : - When the front seat is laid down , my son has to stand as there 's no more room for him to sit.- Sunshade is a little stiff to adjust than my last Graco stroller , but I 'm hoping that it just needs to be broken in a little.- With my son sitting on the back , it 's hard to lean it back and bump it up to go up stairs or over curbs.- I wish the latch was automatic locking , but it 's manual , so when you collapse it down you have to be sure to attach the latch before picking it up.Overall , this is still the best stroller I 've ever owned ! I would have bought this stroller as the only stroller to ever own had it been around when my first was born . I highly recommend it !	1
This stroller met all of our needs . We purchased it for a trip to San Francisco and it was great for our 3 year old and 11 mo old . Our 3 year alternated between sitting and standing and our 11 mo old sat contently in the front . We did opt to click in the car seat when the baby was asleep a couple of times . It is easy to open/close and fits perfectly in both our SUV and Sedan . I would recommend this stroller -- great for the price as well !	1
This has been great . I bought it because we had a graco Snugride car seat . We are still using it one year later without the car seat . My only complaint is that it 's hard for the second kid to sit when the car seat is snapped in . The car seat is longer than the space provided so there was n't enough room for my daughter to sit comfortably when the car seat was snapped in . She had to stand . Now that we are n't using the car seat , it 's great . My only other complaint is that it 's a bit heavy and bulky ; I guess that 's to be expected with a double stroller though . Overall , it 's a good product and with the money .	1
I love this stroller ! It 's about the same size as a single travel system stroller but it holds 2 kids ! It swivels very nicely and I 'm able to push it with only one hand which is nice when I 'm trying to get to an appt and finish a cup of coffee . I routinely use this stroller even when I just have my infant with me because it 's not too big . My 3 year old likes to sit in it too . My only complaint is that the car seat sticks out a bit so my 3 year old has to lean forward more than he should to sit in the sit and stand area . He does n't seem to mind at all though .	1
The stroller is super sturdy yet folds up very easily and tidily . The design is very clever and if you have a baby and a 2-4 year old you will get the most out of it . It is probably the most compact 2 child stroller you will find . It looks great and it is very well-designed . I have no complaints whatsoever and recommend it heartily .	1
This was a great buy . The price was good and it works for me.However there are a few draw backs.- When my 3yr old sits at the back her feet are somehow depressing the brakes . A bit of a humbug.- I also tend to hit my feet in the back step when walking them.- The canopy is ridiculous.But outside of that it works for me !	1
I love this . It holds my Graco snugride ( for my two month old ) and allows my 2 year old to ride comfortably . You have to access the basket from the sides ( or small opening between two seats , but it 's not practical ) , which is n't a big deal . My older daughter loves this . She enjoys the freedom .	1
Amazing stroller ! My 3 year old loves her & # 34 ; standing stroller & # 34 ; as she calls it . The ONLY downfall is that she has to lean forward when my son 's carseat is in the front seat . She does n't seem to mind it though . It fits perfectly in the trunk of my Toyota Camry . Easy to fold , just wish the shade was n't so awkward .	1
I have a 3 yr old and 10 mo old . Initially , I had a single Maclaren stroller and did n't like it ( FYI I had the Techno XLR ) . When I had my second , I was given a stroller frame and that was the only stroller I was using for about 8 months because it was easy to just take the infant car seat out of the car and snap it into the stroller frame and go . A friend had given me a Baby Trend Double Stroller but my 3 yr old who 's tall for her age looked cramped in it , my then 6 mo looked like she was slouching out of her seat most of the time , and it maneuvered horribly . Plus , trying to load the monster stroller into the trunk of my 4 door sedan resulted in horrible language spewing out of my mouth every single time . The Sit N Stand was my answer ! The Good : -Infant car seat can be clicked into place in the front seat . I already have a Graco infant car seat so it was very convenient . No waking up sleeping baby ! -5 point harness . The shoulder harness is looped through the side harness then clicked into place in the center . Now , this is my opinion , but why I like this particular 5 point harness is that with one click , all the parts of the harness falls away and you can just grab your baby instead of first getting their arm out of the each harness THEN pulling them out.-It also maneuvers amazingly , considering it 's a stroller and a half . I can even get away using one hand to move it.-Good size storage area . Like others have mentioned , its hard to get to from the back , but you can easily pull the mesh fabric down from the side to get things in and out of the storage bin-Folds down pretty easily . Fits the trunk of my Acura TL with no problem.The Sort of Bad : -crappy canopy . Come on , Graco . Why would you make half a canopy ? Seriously , either give us a decent size canopy or just do n't provide one at all . Also the canopy does n't adjust all the way forward . I have to do some serious creative maneuvering to keep the sunlight out of my baby 's face.-The lock mechanism for when stroller is folded down . After I fold down the stroller , I have to push down on the stroller to get it slim enough so I can click the plastic piece into place to lock it ( so it does n't open on you while you 're trying to get it into the trunk ) . When I want to open the stroller , i have to do the same . Folding/unfolding the stroller is easy . locking/unlocking it is not . its annoying I just dont bother sometimes.If you have a baby and a toddler , but do n't want a bulky double stroller , this is a great alternative . It will give your toddler an option to sit if they want but wont confine them to a seat . The recline is good enough in the front seat so your baby can sleep . No real complaints so far after a month of usage except to ask myself why I did n't purchase this earlier .	1
This stroller is very light-weight , easier to maneuver than a lot of the single strollers , and very easy to open . My only complaint would be that when I place the baby carrier in the front , some of it sticks out and looks like it would be uncomfortable for the child sitting on the bench part of the stroller ( it 's right on their head level ) however , my 3 year old has not complained about it at all . It is difficult to get stuff in to the mesh basket , baby bag definitely does not fit in there , but I have used it to carry a few small bags during mall trips . I use the Graco SnugRide Classic Connect infant car seat , and you do not need any additional attachments for it .	1
Our 3 year old son loves riding with Mom/Dad and his new little brother . This item is great . Easy set up , folds up great and the pushing is easy too .	1
I was using a bugaboo with the skateboard attachment prior to purchasing this stroller . My wrist was hurting so badly from trying to push the stroller and separate skateboard around that I finally bought this . I LOVE this stroller . It 's super lightweight , easy to fold and is so narrow it can maneuver easily through store aisles . This stroller is the perfect option for a baby and toddler , especially for a toddler who does n't want to sit for long . My oldest moves from sitting to standing easily . I can not recommend this stroller enough . A fantastic buy !	1
Having a third child , I needed something to keep the family together . This is great because baby obviously goes in the front , my 3yo sits or stands in the back and my 6yo walks next to me hanging onto one of the side handles.It takes a little work getting the standing platform to 'snap ' into place , but once you do the rest is easy . My oldest was proud that she got to help put it together.The only thing I would change is there is nothing to make it stand upright on it 's own . You can set the rear brakes and lean it against a wall , but there is no stand attached like there was for the Metrolite that this is replacing . Overall a great durable stroller that keeps everyone together .	1
Finally , I found a stroller with a weight limit that supports my almost 5 yr old ! We are expecting our second in August , but our first will then be almost 5 . Yes , she likes to walk like a big girl for a while when we 're out and about , but as little legs get tired , this stroller in my opinion shall be a lifesaver , because she can just hop on and let Mommy do all the work . I am seeing this being wonderful for trips to the mall . It only arrived today , and we 've not yet used it , as like I said , the new bundle has not yet joined us , but assembly was a snap for me all by myself , and from the laps myself and my daughter took around the kitchen , it strolls very easy and is incredibly lightweight yet seems very sturdy and well built . I went through the attaching of our Graco Snugride , and it is very very easy . My only complaint , ( and so long as my daughter is not complaining , I wo n't ) is that the infant car seat sticks out a bit where my daughter 's head shall be when she 's seated on the toddler bench ... but as cushy as the snugride is , it may actually serve as a neck rest . lol All in all , for the price this stroller seems pretty awesome , and I 'm a super picky Mommy when it comes to strollers , carseats etc . both for comfort and convenience . I think it will fold up small enough to fit within the back of our Impreza , but we 've not yet tried it . *Crosses fingers*	1
I upgraded from my Graco Duo Glider stroller to this one and it 's SOOOO much better ! It 's easy to maneuver ! It also folds much flatter , lighter , and smaller , so it fits in my car much more easily ! It 's relatively easy to put together ( the pin you have to put in to hold the back wheels in are a bit tricky , but nothing that takes more than 10 mins ! ) . My 3 year old LOVES to sit in the back and it does have a strap on the bench , so you can still secure the larger child in . The front seat has the full shoulder strap for smaller babies and with the tray attached , you can still put a car seat on top for newborns . The handle is nicely wrapped in foam and the cup holders on the handle are deep and do n't get in the way of the kid sitting on the back bench seat.There are a few things that made me give it 4 instead of 5 stars . First , the basket underneath is not very big and it 's difficult to get to-I put some bags in there while I was shopping and then had a tough time getting them back out b/c the only way to put things in or out is between the bench seat and the back of the front seat . The sun shade on the front seat is also annoying-it 's VERY rigid , difficult to adjust and when it 's closed , it gets in the way of the kid sitting on the bench seat . Finally , the latch to hold the stroller closed is plastic and you have to snap it on the bolt that sticks out on the side-it 's tough to snap it down ( so that the stroller stays nicely folded flat ) unless you lay the stroller on the ground and put some weight on it to force it closed .	1
I was pleasantly surprised with thee Graco RoomFor2 Stand and Ride Stroller . This stroller allows my younger child ( 1 year ) to sit in a seat with a 5 point harness while my older ( 3 years ) can sit on the jump seat or stand on the platform . This works well since my older child likes to get in and out of the stroller while we go through the store or park while my younger is secure and safe . This stroller also folds for a fairly compact storage size , I managed to fit this and my groceries in the trunk of my car , I think it may be more compact than the stroller from my travel system . This stroller can also hold a graco car seat on the front seat making it a great option for those who are planning for another child or still have a child in a pumpkin seat.The only thing I did not care for was the assembly . Where the directions stated that a simple `` click into position '' would suffice actually required some maneuvering and we ended up using a screwdriver to bend a plastic lip into place to allow for proper installation . Luckily this is a one time thing and is not a problem anymore .	1
What a great stroller ! I wanted something larger that would hold my two kids but did NOT want to be that annoying lady with a side-by-side stroller . So this one fit all the requirements . Joovy also makes one but from reading the reviews , the sit/standing kid in the back was unable to sit with a car seat in the front . What good is that ? It took a few tries to get my toddler okay with riding on the back but now she loves it and always asks to go for a stroller ride . This thing turns great , so much better than my cheaper Graco single stroller , even fully loaded with two kids and a diaper bag in the bottom.I would highly recommend this stroller ! Easy to open , easy to manuever , and the price was great !	1
Graco has been a go-to maker of baby products for many years . I have confidence that I will be receiving a quality product when I see their name on the box . The Graco RoomFor2 Stand and Ride Stroller is no exception . It fills the need to have a spot for an older child while having a safe place for baby.The stroller required the expected amount of assembly - wheels and trays . The platform for the older child to stand on was the hardest to get into place . It did n't just snap in . A screwdriver used as a lever helped . Putting the pins in the rear wheels was made easier with a pair of pliers . The result was a sturdy stroller that steers much more easily than another Graco we have . That 's important because the added weight of a second child would make it a challenge if it did n't steer easily . This stroller also folds flatter than our other Graco.We were able to try out using the infant carrier on the stroller and it fit nicely . We have not tried it with an older child . There may be some problems there , especially when it is used with the infant carrier or when the seat is reclined . Either of these may make sitting on the little seat difficult . I do like the places for the child to hold on when they are either standing or sitting . While there is a place for cargo , it will be a challenge to access it , but you could put a few diapers in there .	1
Very easy to open and close . I use this when I go with my sister , my son and her two kids to the mall or where ever we end up at . It is very convenient and easy to maneuver . I get compliments and questioned when other parents see us with this stroller . Worth the money spent .	1
Love that I can snap my graco car seat in the front with my infant while my 2 year old sits in the back or stands . My toddler is very active , so he does n't sit in the seat for long periods of time . When he does sit in back , he is n't bothered by having a little less room . Other reviewers complained that there was n't much room in the back seat when the carseat is up front . This could be a problem if your child needs to relax in the back , but it has n't been an issue for us since my son likes to get on and off instead of sitting the whole time . I guess I could be upset that he likes to get up and down or touch his feet on the ground sometimes , but HE 'S A TODDLER . That 's how they explore and learn ! Parents should encourage and teach flexibly , not get upset that their child prefers to have fun however he can ! After checking out the Graco Ready2Grow at Babies R Us , I went with this one since it is way less bulky and was a better choice for my energetic toddler .	1
This teether is ridiculous . It 's huge , it 's hard to clamp down on , and my daughter had no idea what was going on when it started vibrating in her mouth.It 's just too big , awkward , and hard to push down on . Not worth the money , in my opinion .	-1
This product sucks . My little boy LOVES to chew on things while he 's teething - and he bites down hard . He was never able to bite hard enough to get this dumb thing to vibrate . Very disappointing .	-1
My baby liked the massaging action but it took time for him to realize how to do it . When he finally did , the battery gave out nearly the same day . The battery would work in short spurts after a rest but I would n't waste my money on it again .	-1
I thought this would be great for my teething baby , but the vibration freaks him out . He wants nothing to do with it . = ( It might be a wonderful product for other babies , though ! It appears to be well-made .	-1
Our 6 month old ca n't bite on this thing hard enough to make it vibrate on his own , so we have to squeeze it and help him hold it in his mouth ( it 's also heavy ) . He seems to enjoy the way it feels , but it 's actually so hard to squeeze that even our hands get tired after a minute or so . Maybe better for older teethers ?	-1
I had this very teether for my twin boys 8 years ago and they absolutely loved it . So , when my new baby started teething , I sought out the same teether . I was surprised when it arrived and the packaging stated that the product is , `` safety tested '' for BPA , lead , and phthalates . It does not state ANYWHERE on the package that it is BPA free . As a former regulator ( of medical devices ) I am very sensitive about company labeling and statements . Perhaps too much so . But , I would rather err on the side of caution where my child is concerned , and the lack of clear `` BPA free '' labeling on this product gives me pause . Specifically , when they test it for BPA , lead , and phthalates , is there an acceptable amount allowed ? ! If not , why would n't the company simply label the product as BPA , lead , and phthalate free ? Eight years ago , when I gave this toy to my sons , no one had ever heard of BPA . My boys put all manner of plastic toys in their mouths , and I 'm sure it was all riddled with BPA . But , in this day and age , when BPA is strongly suspected of being dangerous , I can not in good conscience allow my new baby to chew on anything that MAY contain it . And , though someone on this site indicated that a representative from the company TOLD them it was BPA free , I 'm still skeptical . Again , why not label it as such ? Most companies proudly label their products with that simple language that can not be confused .	-1
Do n't waste your money , my son would rather suck on his fingers than to use this messaging corn teether . The massager really has to be squeezed in order to work . : (	-1
This would have been an ok teething necklace if it were n't for the Star bead . As another reviewer pointed out , if your child chews on the pointy edge of the star it can be very painful . I have thrown this necklace out after having to pull off the road last week when my child screamed suddenly in the back of the car and was then crying hysterically .	-1
I just bought this toy because it was the only one I could find in the store for a stroller.. And of course it wo n't fit on our Graco stroller .	-1
I received this as a gift , unforutnately it did n't fit on our stroller ( pretty standard Graco Travel System ) or on our carseat ( either our Grace or our Marathon ) and so it was pretty useless .	-1
We have/had a Graco Quattro and a MetroLite stroller and This does n't fit on either one ! ! It was a complete waste of money ! Try it in the store on a stroller like you own before buying !	-1
I bought this primarily because it takes regular trash bags , we used it the way it 's supposed to be used for the first couple of days but quickly discovered that as the pail gets full the dropping mechanism gets stuck forcing you to clean out the mechanism whenever it 's time to change the pail , and it 's one more thing to wipe down if a diaper gets too messy . Also , my husband would load the diaper into the top but routinely forget to flip it over to dump the dirty diaper . Now I lift the whole lid and toss the diaper in , this allows me to keep tabs on how full it 's getting and squeeze in a few extra that the mechanism would n't have allowed ... and still trap the smell ! Of course this negates the cool mechanism and makes it a plastic trash can with a tight lid , something I could have bought for cheaper .	-1
This product is n't that bad ... however it is not smell proof . I love the fact that it will take any type of trash bag , but if you do not empty the pail out daily the smell leaks out into your baby 's room and it does not smell pleasant .	-1
Ok , so the idea of the Diaper Champ is awesome -- it is very easy to use -- that 's why I gave it 1 star . However ... the thing REALLY stinks ! ! Someone gave me the Neat diaper disposal system for my baby shower & I absolutely loved it . However , the handle broke on it just 2 weeks ago . I thought ... '' Maybe I could try the Diaper Champ since I wo n't have to purchase any liners '' ... Well that was a HUGE mistake ! ! I see why this thing got 4 stars -- all of these parents have young children ! ! My daughter is 14 months old & because she is older , I guess her diapers come with more odor ! After literally only a few diapers , her entire room smelled of poop ! I could n't stand it ! In one week , I changed the garbage bag at least 4 times . Is that really saving money ? ? I do n't think so ! Plus her room really smelled bad . I 'm taking it back & getting the Neat again ! The Diaper Champ must be great for infants , but you may want to consider something else for older babies !	-1
We got this and the Diaper Decor Plus as gifts and I have to say that the Champ is not my favorite . I like that you can use your own garbage bags with the Champ , but that 's the only positive in my opinion . I find it pretty hard to open it without breaking a nail and it does get fill up much more quickly than the Decor . When you 're changing the bags on the champ , it can be messy , depending on how long you waited to change the bag , but with the Decor , you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it 's full to the brim -- so much easier . I also like the Decor because you can dispose of the diaper with your foot , instead of a hand like with the Champ , because now that my son is super squirmy on the changing table , I need of my hands on him !	-1
After reading the glowing reviews here and receiving a positive one from a friend , we decided to replace a broken Diaper Genie ( lid broke off ) with the Champ . What a disappointment ! Here are the big two complaints:1 . It 's unsanitary . Putting diapers and messy wipes into the slot and dumping them in the bucket leaves the slot a germy mess . Having to clean the slot each and every time is just unrealistic and too much work ! And I fear our toddler getting anywhere near the thing because of the germs.2 . The smell . It 's probably not as bad with an infant , but let me tell you , opening the lid to empty toddler diapers is one frightening experience ! Yikes , what a smell after just a couple days . We used the odor prevention garbage bags , but nothing prepared me for that odor when I opened the lid . Since nothing seals off the individual diapers , it 's just a sea of messy diapers in there . Yuck.On the plus side , it 's wonderful to be able to use regular garbage bags , not the expensive ones the Genie requires . And it 's certainly easy to use . But I 'm not sure how this product is any better than just using a garbage can with a lid.When our second child arrives next year , we 'll be going back to the Diaper Genie . It 's not perfect , but it 's much cleaner and there 's less odor involved ( the reason to get one of these products in the first place ) . And the new version of the Genie is much easier to operate than the earlier model , so we 'll just cross our fingers the lid stays attached next time .	-1
... ... all I can say is the smell is horrible ... ..1 star ... .. Please do n't buy this one !	-1
When my hand-me-down Diaper Genie broke , I bought a Diaper Champ . I figured I 'd save some money not having to buy the Diaper Genie refills . While I was happy about being able to use regular trash bags , that was all that really impressed me with the Diaper Champ.The odor protection of the Diaper Champ really leaves something to be desired . My son 's room smelled very badly , even when I changed the pail every day.Changing the Diaper Champ really is n't a pleasant experience . Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth ( nothing is sealed ) when you open the lid to change the trash bag , but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well , I 'm back to using a Diaper Genie , and my son 's room smells just fine . Save your money and buy something other than the Diaper Champ the first time around .	-1
My husband and I hated this diaper pail from the day we first began using it . The cylinder continually got stuck , and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder . It is no fun pulling apart a diaper pail at 2:00 in the morning because the handle wo n't go down due to a diaper that is stuck in it . Plus , I think it is unsanitary . The diapers are placed in a plastic hole at the top of the pail , and then they drop through to the bag . Well , messy diapers sometimes left a bit of a mess in the opening area , and it was not easy to clean . Finally , after two months of dealing with this pail , one morning , I flipped the handle , and the cylinder fell right into the bottom of the pail . ( It was not a pleasant task to retrieve it , either ! ) I have n't been able to figure out how to fix it , so we are using a Safety 1st Diaper Pail now , and the Diaper Champ will be hauled to the road for the trash pickup next week . I think that for the price , it should have lasted longer than two months . I do not recommend this product .	-1
I found the ultimate crib sheet to be much more trouble than it 's worth . Lifting my daughter 's mattress takes no effort : it 's made of lightweight foam . As a result , changing her sheets is also super easy . I just have to lift the mattress , and it takes two seconds . On the other hand , snapping all the ties on the ultimate crib sheet takes bending over the crib for five solid minutes ( plus , the manufacturer recommends snapping the snaps before every wash , which means snap on crib , unsnap , snap again before wash , unsnap , snap on crib ... ) So , if you have a foam mattress in a corner of the room , I 'd suggest just getting normal sheets and some of those stay-dry liners . If you have a coil mattress and keep the crib in the center of the room , then by all means , try the ultimate crib sheet ...	-1
Was really , really excited to get these , then read what it is made out of , the very bottom layer is PVC . Now why would I want my newborn daughter to sleep on this and breathe it in ? Not in a lifetime . Plus , when I opened the package , it smelled of plastic . I will do the laundry when she messes up the bed and deal with it rather risk exposure to PVC fumes .	-1
The concept of this product is good , but I found the snaps extremely difficult to snap and unsnap ( maybe they get easier with a little wear , but I have n't used it enough to see ) . Therefore , I found it both quicker and easier just to take the mattress out all together and use fitted sheets ( which are also more attractive ) . I would only use this product if you have a mattress/crib set that have a fit making it extremely difficult to get the mattress out . Seems like most crib mattresses slide out pretty easily , making this product pretty unnecessary .	-1
at the head and foot of the sheet there are snaps that can come completely off.one elastic strap end snaps to the sheet then wraps around the crib rail and snaps back onto the sheet . if you undo both snaps you are left with a loose elastic band . baby could choke on it if you ask me . i liked the product for its ease of use.. but once i noticed the straps could snap completely off.. i stopped using it .	-1
The reviews that say this product is soft are all pretty old ( 2002-2004 isn ) . Recent reviews all agree that the product is not soft . Somewhere down the line they must have tried to save some money and made this product . I would n't sleep on this so will not use it for my son 's crib . As far as protecting the sheet it probably does what is says ... but I 'll never know since I 'm returning it .	-1
My sister recommended this product to me , and I wanted to like it . It is very waterproof ! But the waterproof barrier makes this not breathable . My baby would sweat profusely . We always keep our house at 68-70 and dressed him in a cotton sleeper . If he was laying on his back , his chest would be cool , but his back would be hot and sticky . Or if laying on his stomach , his front would be sweaty , but his back cool . Basically , whatever was touching the mattress pad could not breath and it was uncomfortable no matter what temperature adjustment we made.I will say the design configuration is very practical and a great idea . Changing a fitted mattress sheet is a giant pain in the butt . This pad makes it easy to clean up the crib after an accident and speed is critical in the middle of the night.I purchased a felted 100 % wool mattress pad instead and could n't be happier . It was slightly more expensive , but it was worth it . Wool is a truly fabulous product : very breathable , helps regulate body temp , naturally water resistant , anti bacterial and NATURAL ! ! ! ! No man-made plastics or vinyl that you have to worry about weird off-gassing chemicals . My baby stays dry and comfortable .	-1
The strings ripped off when I tried to pull it off of the crib . I also did n't like the idea of this being on top of the mattress and crib sheets . So it might be a good idea if you do n't have a great baby mattress or are n't into decorating the baby space . At first I thought this product was clever , but once I got it I realized how useless it was . It 's so easy to take the crib sheet off of my baby 's crib , so I really never needed this .	-1
I measured the crib before purchasing this , but it was not a hood fit for our standard Jenny Lind crib . Some of the elastic snaps could not stretch far enough to snap closed , so they just hung thee . It did not make me feel comfortable to have those straps dangling since they could have been a potential choking hazard .	-1
Seemed like a good idea , but I did n't care for it . I returned it because it was n't soft . Actual crib sheets are much nicer to look at too .	-1
I bought this , put it on the crib , took one look at it , took it off , and returned it . I have a standard 28x52 crib and this was too big for it -- it bunched and would n't lay flat . Also the snaps did n't match up well w/ my cribs slats and even if they did they were too long to actually be safe and secure . This mattress pad/sheet creates an unsafe environment . My daughter slept w/ us or a bassinet until she was 3 months old and by then the diaper leaks and constant spit up were behind us so I do n't have to change her ordinary crib sheet that often anyway .	-1
I thought I would love this to help do quick crib changes for when a child is sick , or has an accident/leak ... however it is really annoying for me to weave the elastic around the crib slats to fasten the buttons -- really doesnt save time , and since our mattress cover is waterproof I dont really need another waterproof layer .	-1
My son spit up in his sleep for the first 6 months , so this product was wonderful . However , by the time that he was 6 months old , all of my ultimate crib sheets had developed holes and cracks in the plastic backs . The product was such a life saver that I will purchase new ones ( maybe a different brand ) for future children , but I really expected more than 6 months of use out of these .	-1
This is supposed to save time instead of changing out the sheet , but I found it took just as long to change this as it does to change the actual sheet . You have to reach all around the crib to do ( or undo ) all the snaps , which is aggravating and somewhat difficult depending on the placement of your crib . Compared to just lifting up the mattress and quickly pulling off the sheet and putting a new one on , I think this might actually take longer .	-1
Yes , scratchy ! I was quite surprised by the rough texture of the top layer of the sheet . It feels like very cheap , low thread count material , not nearly as soft as most bedsheets . When my daugher used this sheet , she had a skin rash and started getting a bold spot on the back of her head . It 's possible , of course , that these were unrelated to the sheet . However , both problems improved substantially when we removed it and put her on a softer , normal bed sheet.Also , I agree with another poster that this could be a dangerous product , especially if your baby is older and moves around her crib a lot . There is no way to tuck the sides under , as with a regular sheet , so a baby could find her way under the sheet and suffocate . Keep in mind , too , that undoing the snaps is very easy -- so easy , a baby could do it ! The elastic bands connecting the sheet to the crib also make me nervous . Could an older baby pinch or strangle herself in these ? My daughter is now six months , and rolls around her crib . I wo n't be regularly using this sheet anymore . But , there is an upside . This product is AMAZINGLY easy to use . Snap , snap -- that 's it . There is no lifting the mattress . And it is waterproof underneath ( unlike a certain zipper sheet , I could name ) , so in an emergency you do n't have to worry about the mattress . Recently , my daughter had a stomach virus , diarrhea everywhere . To make matters worse , I caught it and was too light-headed to lift a 20lb crib mattress . This sheet was perfect .	-1
I 've had 2 of the ultimate crib sheets and been using them for 7 months now and I do not like them . I do n't hate them , but I do n't like them and will never purchase them again . The idea is wonderful , but parts of the product are too cheaply made . Within the first washing , some of the snaps were pulled off the sheet ( with following the directions to re-snap the sheet before washing ) . That was disappointing . Thankfully , it was only 2 snaps and I was still able to make the sheet function . However , it does take some time to snap the sheet on securely and it is n't very soft or cozy for baby . It has kept accidents from leaking through and it did work well in that area , but as far as adding coziness or comfort or ease of use ... it failed miserably . I bought mine through Babies R Us instead of Amazon but wanted to contribute a review regarding the product because I shop through Amazon much more often . I wish I had been better informed , I would have gotten the quick zip sheets instead . The attachments for the snaps are not well made and I would not recommend this product to new moms . Go for a different crib pad that will protect and add some softness/coziness to the crib . This sheet also does not retain warmth well - even after throwing in the dryer and then putting on crib , it cools quickly and remains cool which may be nice in the summer but not during a winter in South Dakota ... One more additional note , it does take a very long time for these sheets to dry - an extra dry cycle in the dryer . Not handy or helpful .	-1
This product was pitched to me as a `` must have '' by all my mommy friends . It has been good for us in terms of middle of the night accidents ( so we do n't have to put a whole new crib sheet on ) , but there is one major issue with it . The straps do n't line up properly with our crib rails , so it can never be totally attached to the crib . There are always loose straps hanging off or awkward folds in it when we try to strap it down . We tried over and over again to get it right , but to no avail . We do not believe this is an issue with our crib as it is a brand new , high quality one . We finally gave up the idea of strapping the Ultimate Crib Sheet down and now just put it under the regular crib sheet . This is ok , but then when we do have a late night accident and have to pull off the top sheet we always worry about the Ultimate Sheet not being strapped down properly . It 's a good idea , but needs to be redesigned to fit current crib railings . I would n't purchase this product again or recommend it to a friend .	-1
I tried this out on my baby 's standard size crib , and it fit horribly . The little loops that hold it down , do n't seem safe at all ! ! ! And they do n't keep the sheet secure to the mattress . I do n't know how they 're allowed to sell these . They seem like a major safety hazard to me ! ! ! Total waste of money ! ! !	-1
If your child moves around in the bed and you do n't have this positioned exactly where they are they will miss . And it does n't secure to the bed that well . I would look for something bigger and something that fits the entire bed , not just a small section . I 'll probably trash it and get a better one , I do n't want to risk ruining my bed if my 3 year old misses the pad . ! 00 % would not recommend it .	-1
This is an OKAY diaper pail for the money . It does n't TOTALLY eliminate the smell and the bags are hard to change . I do n't even try any more to 'twist ' the bag , I just take the lid off . It is very easy to open and I wonder about my son getting in it as he gets older . If this is all you can afford , it 's not that bad .	-1
Excuse me , ... but this product is so far from being odorless . At first , it was ( maybe a little less than a month ) , odorless then after that , ... there was nothing to get rid of the scent . I even bought some odor discs but they did n't work either . The only convenient thing about this is that you can put whatever garbage bag you want in it and even then , the bag can hold many diapers .	-1
My husband and I picked out this diaper pail when I was pregnant with my son because friends told us to get one that uses regular garbage bags . That turned out to be the only perk of this diaper pail . The springs have been popping off since about the first month . My son is now 10 months old and recently one of the springs broke , which completely gets rid of the supposed & quot ; odor-free & quot ; feature ( which I found was n't exactly true either ) . Now that we are expecting baby # 2 I am going to have to buy another diaper pail to replace this one . My advice : Do n't waste your money . It 's just as efficient to throw your diapers in a regular trash can .	-1
What a waste of money and more importantly my time ! This thing does not work well at al ! ! I ca n't fit a larger cable through it . PLUS if you have plugs that go sideways like our ROKU does . You ca n't use it . So i had to buy a power strip but the power strip is too thick and wo n't work . So this ended up in the garbage .	-1
There are two pieces to the outlet cover : back part replaces the outlet cover ( and needs to be screwed on ) and the front cover , which is released from the back cover by squeezing the two plastic pieces on the sides . The plastic side pieces are part of the back part , made of stiff plastic and extremely difficult to squeeze . This outlet cover also did not fit one of my outlets ( it would not stay flush to the wall ) .	-1
Unfortunately you can not tell from the picture , but this product is not well designed . It projects far out from the wall , and can not accommodate any plugs larger than a two prong ( meaning non grounded ) table lamp cord . Anything like a power strip , laptop cord , etc , will not even be able to be plugged in because the casing blocks it . In addition , the slot to feed the cord through to exit the device is also very small and fits almost none of the electronics in my house . It also sits on top of the outlet cover , so there is no way to really secure it tightly and it can rotate a bit .	-1
I had a couple major issues with this outlet cover. # 1 : The screw that probably is in your existing wall outlet covers is not long enough to accommodate this outlet cover . They made it much thicker than the outlet cover it replaces so for me , I need to go purchase a handful of screws. # 2 : Box is not big enough to accommodate ANYTHING except basic , small , two-prong plugs . So what wo n't fit ? Our laptops , our phone charger ( Samsung Galaxy has a small box that plugs into wall ) , iPod chargers , computer charger , power strip plug , light dimming plug attached to lamp , DSLR charger , baby sound machine , Verizon Fios plugs . Well crap ... what appliance plugs DID fit , you ask ? A lamp . Just one lamp . Oh , and the electric toothbrushes.Useless , sending them back . The Safety 1st units are square ( not pyramid shaped ) and hold various plugs .	-1
If you want to keep the plug in there forever , it is the best one . But the first time , you still need to open it to install . After you put it on the wall , it 's really hard to remove . Another con is the cover is too small , that I can not put anything other than a stand lamp in it .	-1
The slots for the cords on the bottom of the cover are too small . I wanted to be able to thread the powerstrip 's cord up into that -- but this is meant for thin wires like a lamp or something -- not a thick wire . Also , it would n't cover the box of the cell phone charger , either . This is for very basic wires and plugs .	-1
I bought this thinking it was a great idea but you ca n't use it with any plugs that have a larger than standard plugs . I feel everything of my children 's has an oversize plug that goes in the wall . Have yet found anything to use it for .	-1
These were a complete hassle to pry apart just to install them . My mom and I each held a side and pulled , but nothing . I finally had to shove in the latches as far as I could to get them apart . Since that seems to be the only way to take the cover off , I had to leave the latches pushed in , defeating the purpose of keeping kids from pulling them off . Definitley something I would use as a permanent fixture . It 's too much of a hassle to take it off every time you need to plug something in . I plugged in what I needed to and have not intention of switching them up .	-1
I attempted to pop this thing open for about 20 minutes then gave up . It took both my husband and I 10 minutes to finally pry it open . Yes , it 's childproof , but also adultproof too which is not convenient at all . It also does n't fit all outlets . I ended up getting the Safety 1st covers because they do n't have the sides that have to go into the wall , instead they protrude out .	-1
The only other cover I could find would n't fit my power strip so I ordered this one . It seems sturdy and does fit fine , but the opening is way too big . My 8 month old could definatly fit at least a few fingers all the way in and touch the plug in no problem because I could . I decided to keep it and put clear packing tape around the opening .	-1
I returned this product due to the several reasons : - It is too bulky- I ended up pinching my finger while installing it ( do not want my child to do it since he will be trying to figure out how to open it )	-1
I tried to use this power strip cover for about 2 months when our twin daughters were 8-10 months old . It was frustrating for my husband & I -- hard to get the power strip inside , hard to keep things plugged in , and too big to hide out of the babies view ( not to mention that it 's bulky and a bit ugly ) . For the babies , it became yet another interesting thing around the house that we had to wrestle from their hands . They were able to unplug the cords easily and were starting to reach their fingers into the top hole when I finally gave up on using it . Yes , the cover did keep the babies from actually touching the outlets in the power strip , but I could have accomplished the same thing with a couple of normal outlet covers.In the end , I rearranged our cords making the power strip & this cover unnecessary . It was just too annoying to keep using the cover .	-1
Really ? How could this possibly be useful ? I saw somebody else post that the baby 's hand can fit inside and I thought they were exaggerating . Really , I can reach my fingers in easily or poke a metal object through even easier . The baby 's whole hand fits through the giant gap . Plus the thing is huge . Like almost as big as a shoe box . And really ugly . I do n't know what we 'll replace it with since the others do n't sound better , but I know there is no point in decorating my living room with baby proofing for show . There 's no way I could leave baby in there with this while I was out of the room , so I might as well just leave the cords as is .	-1
I bought this power strip cover to protect my toddler from the power strip we have under a chest in our living room . The design is sturdy and fits our power strip perfectly , it is also easy to put together . But it has two big minuses:1 . Its height . The wires can bend but this is about 1 inch higher than the plugs , so if you want this to go under a piece of furniture you may want to consider whether it fits under or not . It barely fits under our chest.2 . THE REAL ISSUE : The width of the slot through which the cables come out . MY TODDLER 's HAND AND A PORTION OF HIS ARM fit through the slot perfectly , so he can reach the outlets AND the switch of the power cord . What is the point of this item ? We just hope , at this point , that it will be a further discouragement -- and since the piece is all but wedged under the chest , we will get to him before he can pull the thing close enough to stick his little hand in . Hopefully we 'll find something better soon.You can presumably use it by covering every unused outlet in the cord with outlet covers . Although the toddler will be able to reach in , he will probably not have the strength or dexterity to pull out the outlet covers while his hand movements are limited by this shell . This , of course , would not stop him/her from turning the switch off -- in our case , this means resetting the clock and being without a phone for however long it takes us to notice the deed , among other bothers.In summary : buy it only if you mean to attach it to the wall . And if you are planning to do the wall , keep in mind that this is pretty big -- like attaching a 1L bottle of soda to your wall , only it is a solid , ugly off-white contraption with wires spewing off it .	-1
It 's funny how many people have positively reviewed this . Yes , it 's very convenient , easy to use , and fits well . What it does n't actually do is effectively COVER the plugs ! It 's trivial for a small child to fit their entire hand in the rather large opening . In fact , I just plugged something in without having to remove the cover . If I can fit my hand in there , so can a child . And it does n't even begin to protect against a child sticking a metal object in there . This product is , in a word , worthless.I recommend getting one of the power strips that has sliding covers on each of the individual outlets , or simply placing standard child-proof covers on the outlets of your existing power strip . But please do n't use this product and think you are adequately protecting your child from shocks .	-1
This fits a very specific style of power strip . Fully straight , single row .	-1
Seriously , I just got this , and this product is not worth a single penny . It is too bulky and gets in the way . Even when it is on its smallest setting ! Not just that , but there is a large opening at the top for the cords to fit through , but the gap is so big , my kids can still unplug the cords and play with them .	-1
To bulky , not what I expected or needed . Needless to say I gave it to a family member that could use it in a different area . Would not buy again .	-1
This powerstrip cover is pointless . Any child can get their hand in it and get shocked .	-1
These are a great idea but did n't work for me . Our cords are thick and long and would n't fit inside the box .	-1
Many kids have been able to remove safety devices in less than 30 seconds . It takes less than 5 minutes for a parent to leave the room to get something and return to find their child hanging from the cords ... DEAD ! ! ! It is safer to spend the money and go CORDLESS ! ! ! But if you must keep your corded blinds , get the Fashion Wand ( approved by PFWBS ) . Go to Parents for Window Blind Safety ( PFWBS ) website and read all the testimonials of kids who died or were severely injured by blind cords . Watch the videos they have of kids bypassing or breaking safety devices on cords in less than 30 seconds . And then decide if you want to install a safety kit or remove the danger altogether .	-1
Although the design of these is to wind the cord shorter , when a window is open and blinds are drawn the cord does get longer . I left a room for 30 seconds and came back to see that my son had pulled the cord down and had it wrapped around his neck . Terrifying . Although these do pop open easily , they most definitely did not pop open from the pressure of a child 's neck which I find to be a SERIOUS design flaw . From a company named Safety 1st - back to the drawing board on these !	-1
This product is useless . After installed , I could still open the oven door with my pinky finger . The directions were also unclear and the picture does n't match the product .	-1
This item wo n't attach to a regular stove because the adhesive wo n't stick to the sides . Also , it comes unlocked too easily if you can manage to get it to stick to the oven .	-1
My 15 month old daughter was able to pull this thing apart with little effort . I would not recommend it .	-1
I do not reccomend this product at all ! It did not stick well , and my 11 mo old daughter popped it off the first time she pulled on the oven door !	-1
This product is a great concept , BUT it has a critical flaw for me . The whole idea that I need to drill a big hole inside each cabinet door or drawer is a non starter . I mean , why would you spend money on a nice kitchen only to drill holes inside doors and drawers ? Hello ? Baby will grow up eventually so the locks are not needed . What about those holes ? It is cute that the manual says `` do not drill through the door , '' hugh ? Why would I want to even have a drill near my cabinet doors ? Also , what happens if say the door cracks while I drill ? Who pays for that ? I know the answer to that one - > ME ! Soooo ... .product is going back . Non-starter	-1
This sounded good in theory , but did n't work at all . They were correctly installed by my husband , but the magnet is just not strong enough to get it to open . It was a waste of money for our cabinets . It may work if you have the thinner particle board cabinets , but it definitely did n't work through our solid wood cabinets .	-1
On the first use of this item a sliver of metal fell off . If I was not in a well lit room and paying close attention , my 7 week old could have gotten seriously hurt . To add salt to the wound , I tried to return the item and I got two separate emails from the seller . The first email asked me to describe the defect . I responded to the email . After which , I received a second email asking me to send a picture of the item ; SERIOUSLY ! 1 . Do you think I am storing the sliver of metal to take a picture of it ? 2 . If I described the defect as a sliver of metal , the product would look the same as in the original picture of the item , as a sliver denotes a very small piece , so the seller already has a picture of what the product looks like . 3 . If the seller needed a picture , this should have been requested in the first email , not in a second email . I shop online because I have limited time . I do not have time to respond to an email trail for a $ 3 nail clip . However , I am so irritated with the product and the seller 's response that I decided to write this review . In addition , my request to return the item was closed before the return approval process was completed !	-1
These nail clippers are dangerous and I threw them out a long time ago . I tried to trim my 3 month old son 's nails , granted he is the fidgeting type . Just as I was about to clip one of his nails , he jerked his hand and I accidentally cut off the tip of his finger . His finger bled , my son cried and I panicked . Thankfully it was a shallow wound which healed quickly and did not do any serious damage . But if I knew how dangerous these clippers were I would never have used them in the first place.Instead I use baby nail scissors by same company . They are VERY safe . I have used them for over a year and have never had any accidents . I shudder to think of using nail clippers again , especially now that I have to chase my son around the room to cut his nails .	-1
this thermometer is pretty consistent , but the nipple is too large for young babies . after my 2 month old gagged on this twice he started refusing his other pacifiers !	-1
The nipple on this thing is HUGE and pretty hard so I do n't think it would work for most babies because it would gag them and they probably just would n't like it . I 've tried this in my mouth , it is n't comfortable like regular pacifiers at all and it took so long to reach a temperature I took it out of my mouth before it was done , this was over 2 minutes so I do n't even know if this thing is accurate at all.My girls were preemies and this was WAY too big for them . I 've tried to use this thing many different times and my girls always spit it right out , even if I tried to hold it there they would push it out with their tongue , they HATE it . My girls are currently 14 months old and love their Binky pacifiers but I 've tried to get them to use this to take their temps several times and they make a face & push it right out.My girls HATE & have always hated having their temperature taken under the arm pit but they do not mind it taken rectally , it IS very easy and the most accurate . I use an Exergen Temperal for when they are sleeping because it is accurate enough to let me know if they have a temp and if it is a high temp . If it shows they have a higher temp then I get them up and take their temp rectally to make sure I get the most accurate temperature . I recommend the Vicks Rectal Thermometer for that.I think companies make products like the pacifier thermometer because as new parents it sounds like a good idea but in reality , they just do n't work and I 'm sure your Dr will tell you the same thing .	-1
My baby is two years old now and he loves his pacifiers . I bought this when I was pregnant because I thought it would be a brilliant way to measure a babys temperature but I was wrong ... As a new mom I was wrong about a number of things ... this was one of them . No baby is going to keep a pacifier in his mouth long enough to actually get the temperature measured if it is not his ( her ) pacifier that he ( she ) loves and always uses . Any baby will identify this as a strange object and spit it out immediately , its too heavy . Especially if the baby is not feeling well . Do n't buy this . Get a real thermometer .	-1
I never wanted a tub because I was not impressed with anything I found but my sister got me this as a shower gift . I just do n't think baby is comfortable in it . His leg was all scrunched up , his head fell to one side ( unpadded , by the way ) , and it was hard to fit it over my bathroom sink because it 's a small round thing . Anyway , before I had the baby , I bought my husband a bath head cushion ( the kind you blow up ) from Target which he never used ( too girly I guess ) . Turns out it is the perfect cushion ( it has suction cups ) to attach inside our sink and put baby in for baths . It has grooves so baby 's head does n't flop everywhere . I bath baby in no time and I have the water running because he loves the feel of water streaming down onto his body . The cushion also allows me to flip baby over so I can wash his back . He just lies on the soft terry cloth . It 's perfect .	-1
I am sorry I bought this tub . It is very uncomfortable for my daughter . Used it since she was about 3 weeks old . I have to place a towel behind her head b/c the hard plastic is at such a sharp angle it 's uncomfortable . Also , there is a part where she got her foot stuck and she screamed with pain ! It 's way too small . She 's now 4.5 mos and I 'm throwing it away b/c she is practically flipping out of it . And the plug is waaaaay too hard to plug - it 's an enormous effort to plug it each time.I 've switched to the First Years infant to toddler tub and it is way bigger , nicer , more comfortable , and it has no areas to pinch fingers or toes .	-1
This is OK for the short time that I am actually going to use it because it does get the job done . However : -it does not hold a lot of water , so the water gets cool fast-the cusion is not that soft so I still have to put my hand under my babies headThe good news is : -it folds for easy storage-it has a little area for you to put the bathing items that you use such as some soap , wash cloth , or toys	-1
I bought this tub before my son was born , thinking it looked great and I could use it in the kitchen sink . I do like that I can use it in the sink , but he 's not a super long baby and his little feet always get stuck in the grooves where the tub folds ! It does n't hold much water , either . I wish I had read reviews before I bought it , because now , after only 2 months , I 'm just going to replace it and throw it away . What a waste !	-1
If you are really , really , REALLY hard pressed for space , then maybe this tub is for you ... except that you 'll only use it for 3 months because it is so small and then it will sit in storage wasting that valuable space . As with most tubs , this holds maybe a quart of water , which means , only babies bum is wet , how fun is that . And as soon as baby can sit , that is if she has n't outgrown this small tub by then , she will not want to lay down at the angle this tub puts her at . Save space by getting a little bigger tub that will spend more time holding your splashing baby than sitting under your sink : I have the Newborn to Toddler Tub by The First Years -- my baby is a year old and I still use it ( she is petite , but I 'm sure anyone can get at least 6-9 months out of it . )	-1
I got this as a shower gift . The first time I used the tub my baby kept slipping around in the tub . She wound up sideways in it during the entire bath and I never used it again . I would just as soon put her into the bathtub and put a couple of inches of water into the tub and bathe my baby that way rather than put her into this contraption . I am a RN and quite used to giving baths in different settings so it is not inexperience talking here . I currently put her on the safer bather ( read my review ) or put her in the tub alone . Baby loves bathtime and is 6 months old.Lets just say that this tub is downstairs with the rest of the lawnsale stuff for this year ... ..	-1
I bought this tub without doing any research on it . I bought it because I liked the idea of it growing with my baby . Well , I got it together all right but it is WAY too big for the bathroom and/or kitchen sink so I had to put it in the big tub from the very beginning . Also , I have yet to get it to shrink , so I have this huge tub in the bathroom all the time . The sling seemed to work all right when my son was smaller , but now he is 4 months and he loves to kick . However , that causes him to slide down the sling and it 's quite hard where the sling ends , so he ends up with this red mark on his lower back . Also , it just does n't seem to hold water . I have read the directions and everything but the water just leaks out . All in all , I will give this tub another chance once my son gets older and can sit up but if it still leaks , I am getting another one .	-1
I looked everywhere for a tub without all the grooves for baby 's body - I wanted something that would submerge nicely from the neck down and this looked like it would do the trick . Unfortunately , it does n't hold any water to submerge anything than perhaps the feet . Leaks horribly , bulky - we gave up , returned it , and now we just bath with baby . Nothing works better than you own hands on your slippery baby anyway , and you can avoid sore knees from bathroom tile and stiff back from bending over the tub .	-1
We 've only used this tub a handful of times because our son is only 3 weeks old . I have not had any problems with the tub leaking . But like I said , we 've only used it a handful of times . I definately do n't think this tub is appropriate for small babies . The tub has absolutely no support for his head OR his body . It takes my husband AND I to bathe him b/c the tub offers no help . It would be just as easy to put him in our full size bath tub . I would n't recommend this tub for small babies .	-1
I hate this tub ! ! ! It leaks everywhere . I do not recommend buying this item	-1
Being the excited new mom I opened this to get a feel for it and see how it would fit in our home and almost cut my finger sliding it open ! I was shocked and then thought if I have not even used it and it does this I do not want ! Plus if it did this to me then what about when I am washing my child . And I read all the instructions before attempting to play with it so I could do it correctly . Right back in the box and I drove back to the store the same day ... .got another brand ... .	-1
I wrote a review a few months ago but I have to edit it . I followed all the directions , I was very careful and patient with this tub , I washed it and dried it after each use and still I find things growing in the crevices and between the top and bottom . The design idea was good but it just is n't practical for a baby tub that will need to be used regularly . The sling slips out of place all the time and the bath ring is n't worth the extra work it takes to clean it and the little ridges that hold it into the tub . No matter how hard I work it 's impossible to keep this tub clean .	-1
This was terrible . It leaked all over the place . Finally my husband put silicone all around it which helped . Save your money & buy the cheap $ 10 one that 's one piece .	-1
I registered for this tub because I thought it is very cool and so multi-functional.After the baby was born and passed his stage of dry bath , I found this tub is not very easy to use . My husband and I coudl n't solve the leaking issue . It also difficult for me to expand or close the tub.The sling is not very good , either.I tried to use this tub for 3 times and returned it . I got Sure Comfort Deluxe instead . I think Sure Comfort Deluxe is a much better choice for new born . It is very easy to put over my sink . The green net comes with the tub is easy to use .	-1
I 've used this tub since my baby was born 6 months ago . There are far more things I dislike about it than like.I liked the sling . I used it alone in the kitchen sink.I disliked the sling in the tub . I felt it did not fasten securely to the tub and there was n't enough cushioning for his head and bottom . My son now sits up on his own but I feel he can slip too easily in this tub .	-1
70 % of the time , the tub does n't leak . The 30 % that it does leak , however , is a fiasco . Here 's how it happens : Once the tub is full expanded and the clips under the side are `` clicked '' into place ( and yes , we did read the instructions ) we fill the tub . Once we finish bathing her , we slide the entire unit forward just enough so that the drain hangs over the edge of the sink and let the water drain . It is at this point that by moving the tub , the suction cups stick to the counter and while moving the tub , it unhooks the clips and out come the waterworks ... .all over the hardwood floors . And let me tell you , it is n't easy to remedy this while holding a wet , squirmy baby . Mothers ( and fathers ) have far better things to do with their time than fiddle with the damn clips and mop up a huge mess . My husband , an MD and engineer says it is obviously incapable of maintaining a reliable seal . Look at it ! Meanwhile , we 're shopping for a different type of tub . We cuss too much using this one .	-1
I pressed and clicked the correct spot like it said in the directions and yet it still leaks . This was a problem because i used it on the kitchen counters for the first week . I had to put towels under it to absorb all the water . So i moved it upstairs to the bathtub and this way i do n't have to worry about all the leaks . Really , who wants a tub that leaks ? ? ? ? My daughter is not yet sitting up on her own and yet she is too long to be reclined comfortably in this tub ... .so we are in an awkward transition phase . a phase that this tub does n't suitably deal with . I would n't buy this tub .	-1
I registered for this and got it home and put it together . It didnt seem to fit together right . I took it back and bought a basic tub and a foam bear pad to lay her on . Much better . less $ $ and easy to use .	-1
It leaks every time I use it . It 's impossible to snap back together if by some miracle you can change the size . I have to put towels underneath the tub to collect all the water that leaks out of it . I love the sling , but I am tempted to beat the tub with a hammer just to take out my frustrations with it . If I could get down on the floor and bathe my son in the big tub with this tub inside , it would probably be easier ( but I do n't think my knees would appreciate it . I received this as a gift and did n't check the reviews before using , I should have . I am currently looking for another solution to this piece of junk . Buy at your own risk .	-1
this tub leaks - i had to put it in my bath tub to use it , which really hurt my back and made me nervous when taking my daughter out of the tub and trying to stand up . couldnt use it on a kitchen counter unless i wanted everything to get wet.doesnt open and close very easily - i gave myself more than one bruise ( due to pinched skin ) when trying to open and close it . also , by the time your child can sit up in this might as well put them in the big tub..my daughter slipped and slid all over when we tried to sit her up.too short - by the time she was 4 months , she was too long for this tub and would kick the sides.i had regisered for the eurotub , but rec 'd this . preferred the euortub by far !	-1
Enough said .	-1
My son is now 11 months old and I have been using this tub since he was 5 weeks old . In the beginning , we used the infant sling , but my baby would constantly slip down into the water . We had to put a large bear-shaped foam bath sponge between him and the sling to minimize the slipping , but we still had to readjust him quite frequently . When he learned to sit on his own , we tried using the bath seat feature . He would arch his back and slip forward into the bath ring , thus painfully squishing his private parts . We decided to try it without the ring and it was a little challenging holding him in place while washing him , but we managed . Now he twists and turns and wo n't stay put in the tub . I have thought about buying a better tub , but since we are so close to graduating him to the big tub , I do n't want to spend the money . Please consider buying something different for your baby . I will not be using this tub for my next child .	-1
I was never fond of this even with the first use . The baby sling never stayed in place and i was constantly adjusting the sling and baby . When i moved to the bath ring it 's plastic edges are sharp and usually scratched him while he moved around . It does n't colapse or open easily leaving a large tub . The only time i was happy with it was once he was old enough to sit in the full tub which is when this is n't needed .	-1
I was so excited when I recieved this tub thinking it would last for years . Well , first you can NOT use it in your home bathtub , because the suction cups will not adhere to a non-slip surface . Most tubs are non-slip , that 's what the little bumps are for in your tub . This was fine though , I planned to use it on our kitchen counter . No matter how hard I pressed on the middle `` locking '' device water always leaked out onto the counter and floor . This tub is more trouble than it 's worth !	-1
I received this tub as a gift at my baby shower . I looked at it and thought what a great idea for a tub . Wrong ! ! First of all , the tub leaks . You can not let go of the baby for one second beacause they will slide . My son absolutely hated bath time until I bought the seat that sits in the bath tub and now he is happy . The sides of the ramp are hard and if they move there head to quickly they could hurt themselves . I would n't recommend this to anyone .	-1
I found it easy to use and it sticks to the bathtub great , BUT my two month old is constantly slipping down and I have to keep pulling him back up onto the hammock . I would buy one that is built with a slanted back and a short basin so baby does n't have far to slide down . Maybe it will be more helpful as he is older and we do n't need the hammock .	-1
This tub was the worst ! Talk about making your job harder than it already is ! It leaks , the sling hardly stays in place , it takes up so much space , and you have to use it in the tub anyways . It is more trouble than it is worth .	-1
DO NOT WASTER YOUR MONEY ON THIS TUB . IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK.MY BABY WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE IN THIS TUB , YOU ALSO ONLY HAVE ONE FREE HAND TO WASH THE BABY . IT ALSO LEAKS FROM THE BOTTOM	-1
We registered for this tub , before doing any research . Big mistake . As a newborn , I used the sling to bathe my son . As he got bigger , I put the sling into the tub ( 2nd way of the 4-1 system ) . Bath time became a pain . My son kept sliding down , even with one hand on him at all times . He did n't really seem to enjoy it either . Finally , after reading great online reviews I bought the Eurobath . LOVE IT ! ! ! ! ! From day one my son had a great time in his new ( huge ) tub . He fits securely into the reclined side of the tub , with no slipping . He is comfortable and there is enough water around him to keep him warm and for him to splash . We 've had it over a month , I highly recommend the Eurobath over this bath tub .	-1
This is the most poorly made baby bath I have ever used . It is impossible to get folded and unfolded . When you do get that figured out then you get to deal with the stupid sling . My baby kept slipping down and her ears would get under water . She is now to big for the sling , but to small to sit up in the ring . I gave it a fair try , but I had to go out and buy another bath . It seems like a great concept , but it is really just a waste of [ money ] .	-1
I used this bath for the first 3 months and it was great when using the sling , but when my son got too big for the sling and was sitting up , we tried the sitting position . But my son would just slip down and would cry because it was uncomfortable for him . I would not recommend this bath tub . There are other tubs with slings that are much better .	-1
this is the worst bath tub i 've bought . i returned this item right away . it leaks . once i pulled it out to be longer but , no matter how much i struggled to put the extension back together , it just would n't click . when i pressed it to lock the extension , i could n't tell whether it locked or not , so then i put water to test the lock system . the result was that my kitchen counter and floor were a mess.now , i bought the Euro bath . it does a good job .	-1
This tub is okay , but not the best there is . Our son is 3 months old and fairly long , 25 inches . He ca n't sit on is own yet , so has to lay on the sling . He loves to kick and splash and does n't have the room he needs . He also slips down the sling frequently . There 's got to be something better ...	-1
Who is very chatty and outgoing . He 's five months old now . It startles him and made him cry a few times . Decided it was a bit too 'manic ' for him . Maybe when he 's a bit older .	-1
I was so excited to get this for my 1yo , and it is a great toy ... My 1yo & 3yo love it . BUT it has an issue with batteries ! When it arrived ( with included batteries in a `` try me '' box ) , the batteries were dead . It 's not being played with at a rate that warrants having to change the batteries once or twice a week . When it begins getting low on power , the music sounds warped , like an old warped record , which is dreadful ! Perhaps we got a defective one . I do n't know . I hope this is n't happening to others .	-1
This thing as so loud and piercing . My son does n't really care for it . It 's heavy for a baby to hold and does n't really do much .	-1
This toy seemed very well liked and is recommended on many toy homepages in the Top Ten Toys . I had high hopes but my little boy just does n't seem interested . We received it early on and I think he liked the sounds of it somewhat . He is now almost 14 months and does n't really play with it unless he is prompted by me . Even then he 'll only shortly press some buttons and then usually starts picking it up and throwing it . This thing is heavy for a little person and I 'm afraid that it could hit his foot or smash through our french doors . I thought it might just take him a little while and that he would be interested as he grows older but so far we could have done without it .	-1
We ordered this toy from Drugstore.com , which showed a picture of an older model , not the new `` upgraded '' toy . The idea of this toy is intriguing but the actual execution of the idea is less than stellar . The `` music '' is tinny and unattractive . Apparently , the older model had better sound quality , which is why I went with this vendor . However , communicating with Drugstore.com and the whole return process is a significant hassle . The also blamed the deceptive picture they used on a glitch with the manufacturer . I would actually recommend either getting a used model with all purple corners ( the older model ) or buying it at a brick and mortar location so you can actually listen to it . If you are going to purchase on Amazon , consider another vendor . Very disappointed . I will not do business with this vendor again .	-1
I worked in the church nursery for over 4 years with this toy in one of the toyboxes available to the children . I never saw any of them properly engage with it . They 'd pull it out , bang it a couple of times ( starting up 2 different sounds ) and then get bored and crawl away . It was the one toy I knew I 'd never buy for my children .	-1
The product is very fun for my daughter of 12 months , but the sound is so electronic that all of the selective instruments sound kind of the same . How hard would it have been to have actual recordings of instruments ? I guess they do n't have actual instruments in China .	-1
I am so glad I read the reviews and purchased the original Embryonics one instead of the one made by Munchkin . The sound difference is amazing . I 've heard the Munchkin one play in person and it sounds like it is dying and about to run out of batteries . Seriously save yourself some money and buy an original one ( even if it 's used ) . I got mine on ebay .	-1
My children ( an infant and a preschooler ) like this toy -- but it is WAY too loud . I wish there was a way to turn the volume down . I 'd return this if I purchased it at a store , but it 's too much of a hassle to return this to amazon . So sad .	-1
The musical sounds do n't sound like the real instruments , they just sound like a cheap toy . Also , I thought each instrument would play its own melody , how it would in a real orchestra . For example , the horn would play the background , the flute a lighter melody , then all the instruments would combine to create the true melody when the orchestra button is pressed . But really , each button plays exactly the same notes except with a different instrument . I was really disappointed , and my daughter prefers the music buttons from her Tiny Love Activity Center . The ones on that toy are really neat .	-1
So , first when I opened it I tried to remove the packaging strings and there was no way to remove them so I ended up cutting them ( but a small piece was left inside the cube at 4 corners ) ... The music choices are pretty annoying and I am not someone who gets annoyed by baby tunes . To change the tune you have to press twice on the orchestra side rather than only once , which I find annoying . Overall my LO does n't seem too interested in it just yet .	-1
I love that there is an off switch , and it would be very difficult for a baby to turn it on . My baby received this as a Christmas gift , and she likes it quite a bit , hence the second star . But why , oh why , did n't they put a volume switch on this thing though ? ! My older children like to turn this on to play with their little sister , and it is ok for the first few minutes , but it is so darned LOUD , I 'm practically loosing my mind . I have to take it away , so what is the point of having a toy that gets forgotten about in a cupboard somewhere ? As for good points , there are lots of colors obviously , and baby can choose just one instrument or the whole orchestra sha-bang . The individual instruments do n't REALLY sound authentic , but it was a nice try . The musical arrangement was a nice choice , too . But please MUNCHKIN , for the sanity of future parents receiving this as a gift , put a volume control on it ! ! ! If you are looking for a great gift for a parent , seriously considerPlayskool Busy Poppin ' Pals ( Colors May Vary ) , it 's lasted through 3 kids , six years , and still going strong . It 's nice and quiet , too .	-1
Too loud . Too hard . Buttons do n't depress easily or distinctly . My 6 month old has fallen headfirst onto the cube and has cut her forehead and chin and jaw on the hard ( ! ) unpadded edges . The corners have sufficient covers but why not the edges between corners ? ? ? Buttons require too much strength to push for a 6 month old . She can sometimes manage it her feet if cube is braced against other object . Definitely NOT for under 1 year olds . Battery replacement requires screwdriver.Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube	-1
This music cube is a great idea , but unfortunately the sound quality is terrible . The violin does n't sound at all like a violin . Overall it 's very tinny and hard to listen to .	-1
Borning toy and my son was over it the minute he opened it up . Music is nice but the buttons are hard to press for a child so be ready to sit there doing it for them . Given the age that a kid outgrows this , you wo n't have much use for this very long .	-1
I like this seat mostly because Elmo seems to have magical powers over little ones ! If your kid is like mine , however , and likes to sit on the potty `` unproductively '' you might want to consider something a little more comfortable . The plastic frame that the cushion sits on has a rim around the inside . While your child is sitting , the fairly cheaply made cushion settles down and your child 's butt is now resting on the edge of the hard plastic . Our daughter would always get up and complain about her butt hurting . Depending on what kind of toilet seat you have , it also has a tendency to slip around . I had to put some non-skid pads on the bottom so that it would n't fall into the toilet with a toddler 's wiggling around . You could end up with pinched fingers or a soaked tot .	-1
We have an elongated toilet and I do n't know of anyway to hold this seat in place . My daughter has trouble sitting back far enough because when she tries to scoot back , the whole seat goes with her . So when she pees , it gets in between the potty ring and the toilet seat and makes a big mess .	-1
this is a good toilet ring , but ONLY if you have the smallest , round toilet seats . the package blatantly lies in saying that it fits elongated seats - it will fit , but it 'll also slide around and leave large gaps . my home has a mix of elongated/round seats , and i found that the baby bjorn rung is the best for the larger bowls . we use that for our elongated seats , and this ring for the tiny toilet that 's in the hallway . otherwise this ring - which can not be adjusted to fit - will slide around a lot and feel very unstable when you 're trying to toilet train .	-1
My daughter liked the seat she had ( Primo Ducka ) but really wanted a seat with handles for pooping . This little seat seemed to fit the bill and was cheap enough that I did n't mind buying another seat.Yes , it `` fits '' elongated toilets . But there is nothing to keep it from sliding around on the longer toilet seat underneath it - no clamps , no pegs , no rubber feet , nothing ! Every time my daughter tried to sit down , the seat would slide 4 inches backwards - landing her on the pee guard . If I start with the little seat as far back as possible , it 's too far for her to get on without help ( she 's nearly 3 ! ) and once on , her feet do n't touch her fairly tall step stool . It needs to be at the front of the toilet seat but it wo n't stay there . So I have to be with her to hold it in place so she can climb on . Not a problem if you are starting out - you need to be with your child - but this is a problem if your child knows how to use the potty and wants to express her independence and `` do it herself '' .Once she is sitting with the seat in the proper place , the biggest complaint starts . This thing collects pee . The little pee guard is pointless . From what I 've seen pee guards are needed by some kids , not by others - regardless of sex . My daughter needs one - a decent one . This one just deflects her pee all over the seat , the floor , her pants , her shoes . In short , a drippy , nasty mess that has to be cleaned every time it is used with extra laundry . I shudder to think of the muck that is accumulating in the foam under the vinyl.She wanted one with handles . Fine . I 've added two simple drawer pull knobs to our Primo Ducka potty seat . She 's pleased . This piece of junk went in the trash .	-1
Really , how hard can it be to design one of these things ? This fails for two basic reasons:1 ) It slides backwards on the toilet seat making it unstable and hard for my daughters to sit down . This is an enormous design flaw.2 ) The pee guard is basically flush with the seat , so what is its purpose other than to decrease the actual potty-business real estate ? It takes away room for daughters ' pee to go down . And it 's not high enough to save my baby boy from getting soaked when my daughter did n't clamp her knees shut tightly enough to prevent her pee from shooting cleanly over the guard and onto baby 's head . He was not pleased . Neither was I.I also have a two mini-potties , the Fisher Price froggy and singing ducky . The pee guard on the froggy potty is great . I love this low-tech seat as it 's easy to clean and hands down my twin daughters ' favorite . The singing duck potty was more expensive , is much harder to clean , is annoyingly loud and wakes up the baby , and there are a lot more spills due to the lack of pee guard . Highly recommend the froggy potty if you are in the market .	-1
Not good quality and did n't fit my toilet . I suppose its ok as a travel one if you need that .	-1
We had a seat SORT OF like this when my son was training - and lost it . Not sure if it was the same manufacturer or not . It had no handles then , and the pee guard stood up high and was removable . We never used the pee guard , it made it harder to get on the seat and it just was n't needed - we just taught my son to point it down.Now I am training twin girls and thinking Elmo might get one of them on the potty more ( one shows way more interest than the other - it 's the reluctant one I want to bribe ) We have little potties with inserts that come off but most parents know the power of Elmo - I 'm willing to try anything at this point , within reason . ( ie the all-out free standing elmo potty is too much , LOL , and I want to take advantage of the fact that both are willing to use the big potty with an insert ) The reviews about the pee guard on this were so puzzling I had to see it in person before buying it - and it looks TERRIBLE . It 's a very low pee guard . Basically too low to serve any purpose for a boy , but it 's there , and it 's high enough that boy or girl I can see them peeing on it and making more of a mess than if it was n't there . ( One of my girls likes to look down and kind of shift her stuff forward as she pees - not normally a problem , but with this in the way , it would be ) And it does not come off . I actually stood there in the store contemplating if we could cut it out somehow , maybe with a dremmel , but you should n't have to make modifications to a potty ring . It 's one of the worst designs I can imagine . It 's like I can kind of see what they were thinking but they should have thought harder . So I decided to skip this . Even if we were to have marginal success with it , I am pregnant with another boy now , and I refuse to buy something I know he wo n't be able to use.I am really kicking myself for not replacing my son 's potty ring when we lost it , but he was doing well enough without it and I never saw it becoming a hard to find item . No handles made it easier to travel with . We kept it in our diaper bag . Now I am in the market for a used potty ring !	-1
A sticker on the packaging clearly stated that the potty material includes a known cancer causing agent . I sent it back to Amazon immediately . My daughter was very disappointed because she loves Dora !	-1
My nearly 2 year old son wants to use the potty , but has trouble with the splash guard/cup on this model . He loves Elmo and wants to carry this seat around but will not use it . We also bought the Primo Ducka . He will sit on that seat all day if you let him . This might be a good choice for parents of girls .	-1
I hate this gate and quality is typical of evenflo . If I had noticed it was evenflo , I wouuld not have wasted my time . It was a pain to install . Total PAIN . Then , when it 's unlocked , it slides for adjustment . The thing is , there is no way to stop it so baby sticks his arm through slates as you open and then you have a broken or badly bruised arm . We put a screw into the wood so it would slide just a little to help prevent that . IF we had known about the second risk , we would have just taken it down then . THe next morning , it was kid tested . Yeah , all the kid has to do is push the bottom and it comes out of the bracket causing the gate bend foreward . So far , I have seen my kids push it more than a foot out of position . MAJOR STRANGLATION HAZARD . Not to mention broken bones . The wood is so flimsy it just twist every which way.As far as function goes , when you go to unlock it , sometimes it will not unhook out of the slot . I have had to pratically hang on it to get it open . Also , the gate now leans . When opened , it leans to where a ball would roll for the from to the end of the gate . Not sure how that came about . We have had this gate for a couple of months . My son has been able to push it out since he started crawling . My 2 yrold can almost squeeze out by pushing on it which has lead to her getting stuck when I made a bathroom break . Not a good gate at all . Evenflo just needs to stop . Every product I have had has been crap . I am afraid to buy their carseats . If they ca n't make a good simple baby gate , I would n't trust my child 's life to their carseats . We plan to replace within the next couple of paychecks .	-1
We recently moved into a new house and bought and installed 3 of these gates . Within one week , our 13 month old broke two of the gates . Once by holding onto the rungs and shaking the gate the other time by grabbing one of the rungs when he tripped.Both times the rung popped right out breaking at the top and bottom . This left a gap in the rungs wide enough for our son to stick his head through which means he could get past the gate if we kept it up ( which of course we did n't . )	-1
Update : 6-months later - the sliding mechanism has loosened up considerably with use . It now slides smoothly without pinching our hands . I 've found the gate to be strong and secure - it has never weakened or popped out when my son tries to stand on it . So , if you buy it , try rubbing some wax , or something , on it to help in the beginning , because it was pretty dangerous at first . And also be aware that little hands can still get pinched in between the actual rungs when you 're opening it . That will happen with any slotted , sliding gate . Some further negatives I found is that the latch is loud , and it 's also difficult for grandma to open and close because she has arthritis in her hands . And with it being difficult for her to do , she tries repeatedly and the noise is very loud and annoying . I 'm always afraid she 's going to wake the kids . So , if you have your mom at your house a lot , get something easier . It will save a lot of frustration - for both of you ! -- -- -I 've had this installed for a little over a week and have seriously pinched my skin twice on it . What happens is when you unlatch it , you first have to slide the gate in , then swing it out . There are metal brackets that hold the two halves of the gate together , and in which the horizontal wooden bars slide along to extend and contract ( look at the photo - you 'll see what I mean ) . The sliding movement is quite stiff and hard to do . I 'm sure with use it will loosen , or perhaps I can put some wax on there . But when you 're opening the gate in a rush , as I did today when we were hit with a sudden downpour and I needed to run upstairs to shut the windows , I put too much muscle into getting the darn thing to slide , and the outside of my hand got pinched beneath the metal bracket . The first time I did this last week my older son woke up yelling for me and I wanted to get upstairs quickly before he woke the baby . My hand got pinched under that metal part and I thought to myself that I need to be more careful . But busy parents like us do n't have the time to stop and think about being careful when opening a gate . When we 've got screaming kids and rain coming through the windows , the last thing we should have to worry about is hurting ourselves on a SAFETY gate ! ! I dont ' mean to beat a dead horse , but seriously , that 's not good . The pinch I got today was major painful - I 've got a blood blister that 's almost half an inch long !	-1
2 stars for bad marketing & items missing . We received as a gift , so our annoyance is probably moderated . This review is for product misrepresentation. -- Only received 1 out of 2 volcanoes. -- Image provided with the expressive boy in red shirt is completely misleading . There is no `` play mat , '' but rather a thin piece of rectangular plastic that is more like an over-size disposable place-mat . Only large enough for half the pieces . The scene is completely different from that image . The real image has none of the detail. -- `` Rocks '' are completely useless three-sided thin pieces of grey sides , thus no bottoms and sometimes missing a side altogether . Only received 10 out of 12 , but not really missing them.Half the dinosaurs are very small ( 1-2 inches ) and the other half are more medium range ( 3-6 inches ) . Some people commented of the usefulness of the names printed on the undersides , but we have encountered 2 other brands that provide the same labeling , so that appears to be a given with a variety pack.The use of the big names `` Animal Planet '' and `` Toy R Us '' should be a tip-off . Over-priced small dinosaurs , 6 trees , and a small plastic bin .	-1
We were quite excited to find this product - thought it was like the type of playpen from 20 years ago to use for a child . There was no weight limit and the only height limit on the website was when the child was big enough to climb out - from both Amazon and from Graco , so it was perfect for our larger baby.Lots of disappointment when the package was opened and we discovered that is has the same limits ( in the owner 's manual ) as the regular pack-n-play . Between when I ordered in and when it was delivered , the words PACK 'N PLAY were actually added to the title of it.Luckily , Amazon seems to be pretty good about taking it back , but we are quite disappointed .	-1
As soon as I opened the box , I could tell by the VOC 's that this playard was treated with chemicals . I called Graco to confirm that it is indeed treated with fire retardants . In addition , some of the characters on the side panels contain vinyl ... like the entire face of the sun is PVC . Why would you let your child play , let alone sleep in this toxic chemical stew . I called Joovy about their Room2 Playard . It 's the same size but quite a bit more expensive . The representative told me it was not treated with fire retardants . Definitely worth it to pay the extra $ , knowing my children wo n't be exposed to harmful chemicals .	-1
Be very careful using this play pen . My baby loves playing without shoes or socks on . He was plaing in the play pen wiggling his legs against the walls of the play pen . Apparently the walls in the play pen are made from a very rough netting and scrubbed the skin off my babies toes . At first I could n't understand why he had blood on his toes but then we noticed blood lines on the white netting . From now on he is only allowed to play inside when his shoes are on .	-1
I got these as a gift at my baby shower , so I have n't had a chance to use them until now . Since I 'm breastfeeding , I do n't use them on a regular basis , just for outings . You ca n't pump into these , which is a bit of a hassle , but it 's not too bad . My problem with the bottle is that the bags do n't stay in . The ring does n't hold the bag in , so when I went to feed the baby , he ended up soaked . Needless to say , bottle feeding that day was a disaster . If the bag would stay in , I 'd say I really liked these . Unfortunately , I have n't had one bag stay in yet ...	-1
With all the rave reviews and my love for Playtex VentAir bottles , I was very excited about this bottle . Yet , both me and my baby hated it . First off , the bottle itself is huge , which makes it uncomfortable in many ways . Second , even the slow flow nipple somehow seems too fast and makes my baby choke on his milk . In any case , we used it a couple of times and went right back to VentAir . I would not recommend it .	-1
I have wasted so much milk using this drop-ins system . I bought a box of the 4 ounce and a box of the 8 ounce liners , and in both boxes there have been multiple liners with holes in them and my milk has ended up all over my counter . Any pumping mother knows that it is perfectly reasonable to cry over spilled breast milk , and believe me , I 've done that many times . I 've tried to be good about pouring in just a little bit of milk so that if there is a hole , I 'll only waste a little bit . But , come on , I 'm sleep deprived , and stressed and sometimes I forget , and I end up with 6 ounces of milk on my kitchen counter , and I should n't have to check like that for a product I 've paid for . No good.Out of a box of 100 liners , I would say about 1/4-1/3 have holes in them or leak . That 's quite a lot ; we 're not talking one or two here . Unfortunately , I 've invested in Playtex bottles and Playtex nipples , so now I have to spend even more money buying a whole new bottle feeding system because I can not afford to spill breast milk every fourth time I go to fill up a bottle . I 'm extremely disappointed at having wasted so much money on this system and so much time pumping milk just to pour it on the kitchen counter . I would NOT recommend .	-1
I bought these thinking they would be great.I was wrong . I give my baby breast milk and its just a hassle . I figured I would be saving time because I would n't have to clean a ton of bottles everyday . Well , you are n't able to heat the bottles with the liners in them so you have to get a container dirty anyway to warm the milk and then dump them back into the bottle . Plus you have to keep buying the drop-ins . If I 'm going to have to clean bottles anyway I 'd rather use a bottle that I can store milk in AND heat the milk in.These bottles dont keep air out . Even when I would squish all of the air out of the bag and put the lid on , by the time I went and got my baby and put a bib on her all of the air was back into the bottle . Also they are not good for on the go . There is nothing to protect the liner on the bottom so anything could puncture it making all of the milk leak out.I also dont think they are close to being like breast feeding at all	-1
These burp clothes are extremely thin . They are so gauzy that you can see through them , so they wo n't even work for a game of `` peek-a-boo '' ! These were not thick enough for me to use as a burp cloth , let alone the `` premium '' diaper it is touted to be . These would not work in our house even as a dish cloth , let alone absorbing any type of baby mess ! The only reason I did n't give only a single star is because Gerber was very nice about giving me a refund on these - they guarantee all their products . I just do n't think they described accurately what you are getting . They are definitely not the diaper service quality , however , if you do n't have 3 different levels of diapers to choose from at your local store , how would you even know that there were different grades of diapers when it says `` premium '' on the package ? They need to be more descriptive in their product packaging . For burp cloths , I prefered the Kooshie baby brand which are very absorbant , very soft and durable as well .	-1
I had these exact same burp clothes when I gave birth in 08 to my son so I figured with my second pregnancy I would buy them again big mistake they are made cheaper NOW you can see right through them I am going to have to fold them in half just so it will not go through on to my clothes I do not even think they will make it through a wash load what a disappointment they are worth maybe a dime each at best It is kinda hard to tell how thin they are unless you open the package I would suggest passing these up	-1
I think this product was a waste of money our daughter will not wait for bottle to heat up in this and its just easier and faster to make a fresh bottle .	-1
I kept thinking I must be doing something wrong . I 'd read the directions again and try again . Another , stinking , melted bottle ! And the milk would be scalding hot . If it did n't melt the bottle , the milk would still be cold . I also had a problem with my playtex ventaire bottles leaking from the bottom into the warmer . Then I had the smell of burned formula in the kitchen . Oh ! And it melted that bottle too ! I 'm going back to the old fashioned way . I 'm going to heat water in the microwave and let the bottle soak in it . It is faster , less messy , and lots cheaper . Do n't waste your time and money .	-1
Ehh , I bought this product to avoid my MIL using the microwave to heat bottles . The thing is that it really depends on the amount of milk and size of bottle . The warmer starts right away and creates a lot of steam . What i found is that a cold bottle from fridge would heat up a lot on the outside but a couple shakes and it would still be cold . I didnt find it evenly heated it through.Its still best to just sit it in hot water for a couple mins . : ) But we will use this to keep cool bottles in the freezer pack in the back ( remember to freeze the ice pack ) -Overall , save your money and use the traditional method .	-1
I 've heard some say this is the best warmer available . If so , parents are S.O.L . Heating is SO inconsistent . Same amount of water with the same amount of milk will produce a different temperature every single time . Sometimes way too cold and sometimes way too hot . When the heating indicator light turns off you must be right there to pull the bottle out or it will continue to significantly warm the bottle without any water medium . Be sure to loosen your bottles cap during heating and check to see that the travel disc is not in place . Otherwise , the bottles ( esp . Brown 's ) will overflow . If that happens cleaning the inside of the warmer is a major hassle because the milk will have burned onto the heating plate . The carrier is too short for Mr. Brown 8oz . bottles or any other of similar height . The tubes provided to premeasure water are a joke . The caps are so hard to close and open you need two really strong hands and maybe multiple tools to shut or flip the tops open . Of course , you will likely be holding your crying and squirming baby in one arm while trying to do open the cap and not spill all the water . They tried to get fancy with the shape of the tubes and cap they forgot to make them easy to use.I just ca n't believe that someone ca n't design a better `` mouse trap '' .To add insult to injury , the taps on the handle that are supposed to hold the top of the bottle storage compartment just broke off ... ( picture provided by Amazon is not the current model . refer to the pictures posted by other shoppers )	-1
I really did not like this . We had a warmer that submerses the bottle in water , and we found this worked faster and better . We got this as a second hoping to use it upstairs at night . Decided to just buy a second warmer that uses water , and to use a cooler for the bottles ( our baby needed 4 anyway to get through the night )	-1
the measuring of the water is not comfortable it take more time to actually put the water at its correct measure than just boiling water in micro and using that to warm the milk	-1
I loved this product from the moment I got it . It works wonders with drop ins , And Avent bottles fit into and heat up nicely ... . Sometimes that is . We have been using this with ourDr . Brown 's Formula Mixing Pitcherand it was a life saver for awhile . Now All i can smell on our bottles is burnt milk from the heating plate ... . Now I am not quite sure how the milk could possibly be getting onto it but it does apparently . We have been using it for about 3 months now almost every day , four- five times a day a most and it has considerably started to take longer and longer to heat up.. Before it was done and cooled off by the time the diaper change was over . Now we find ourselves sitting and waiting another minute or two for it to finish . The instructions are basically nonexistent . All in all it still works but I can slowly start to see it go down hill in its heating capabilities .	-1
The idea behind this design is well intentioned but I find the design aggravating . Subconsciously I always go for the handle to move this thing , but the handle is connected to the removable bottle storage piece . There 's no other way to pick this thing up unless you grab it by the warmer cup . It may seem trivial but I like to keep this thing out of the way ( it 's an eye sore ) and I would have rather just the bottle warmer with no bottle storage chamber.Plus , the heating is inconsistent . No matter whether you put extra water or not , the bottles still do n't get warm like they should . When we first got it ( 4 months ago ) the milk would actually be too hot . That has n't happened in a while .	-1
I purchsed this product because of the cooling capabilities as it was perfect for night feedings instead of running downstairs to make a bottle in the middle of the night . We loved it for the first month we had it . BUT , after just about a month of use ( warming 3 or 4 bottles per day ) the warmer started over heating the bottles and sent milk pouring out of the top . I use a variety of types of bottles and specifically the Dr. Browns and the First Years Breastflow bottles were overheated and thus overflowed in this warmer . ( The Advent bottles did not overflow but were so hot to the touch I could n't take them out with my bare hands and thus was NOT going to put the bottle near my infant until it cooled down which tool 5 or more minutes . ) We played with the amount of water we were using , thinking we were putting too much in ( even though we were following the recommended water usage in the instructions ) . That did n't help . After having the product for less than 2 months we are returning it to the vendor where it was purchsed . I would not recommend gettin this product . First Years needs to go back to the drawing board on this one and come out with a product that actually works .	-1
This thing stinks . The on off switch never worked so we always had to plug and unplug it . Plus you can easily over heat your bottles in this . We did like the cooler on the back for travel but overall this thing stinks	-1
I bought this bottle warmer , because the previous model from the same company broke . When I got the new version of `` The First Years Night and Day Warmer System '' , I was shocked on how short the electric cord was . I was also displeased with having to unplug it , in order , to turn it off . I am not happy with the new model . I would try a different brand , if you need a bottle warmer .	-1
Do not buy for glass bottles . Says nothing about this on the website but on the box . Very dangerous because gets so hot	-1
This product is a major piece of garbage . You will NEVER get your milk to the right temperature no matter how hard you try . It will either be cold or it will be scalding hot . Also it creates a smell that smells like burnt hair which is worrisome considering others who reviewed this product ( at least 4 people ) said that it catches on fire . We were using dr. browns 2 and 4 oz bottles and sometimes the 2 oz would be cold while the 4 oz would be way too hot . We always ended up using the tap to correct the temperature and it took forever . We just bought the dr browns delux bottle warmer and its AMAZING ! It remembers how long it takes to warm any particular amount and you dont have to fill it up with water every time the way you do with this . Remove from your registry , return , or throw away if you have bought this product and go with the dr browns instead .	-1
I had this pump on my registry but then was also given a double electric pump ( Medela Pump in Style ) all I can say is GOOD THING I HAD THE DOUBLE PUMP ! This single electric one just can not get enough pressure/suction/whatever . plus even if it DID work , a single pump means double the pumping time . I know double electric pumps are expensive , but beg , borrow , get your family to go in it as a gift - you NEED it and this single pump is NOT an adequate substitute for a real pump ! You can even rent a double pump from the hospital or a lactation consultant . Just do n't bother trying this one .	-1
I agonized over whether to buy this cheaper pump or go straight to one of the high-end ( $ 250+ ) models . In an effort to save money I started with this one . But I quickly realized I 'd made a mistake -- it took *forever* to even get one ounce of milk . I ended up getting the Medela Pump In Style and loved it . I just wish I 'd gone straight to that one and saved my money on this one.For those of you who are trying to decide between this or a more expensive model , here are my two cents : TRY THIS ONE IF ... - You have a very abundant milk supply- You only plan to pump one or twice a month- You would n't mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended periodINVEST THE MONEY IN A HIGHER-END MODEL IF ... - You 're going back to work- Your milk supply is medium to low- You plan to pump more than two or three times per month- You are opposed to giving your baby any formula , ever ( with a higher quality pump you could build up reserve breastmilk to have in case of an emergency ) Also , it 's worth noting that most of the more expensive models can be safely re-used by other people so could be sold to someone else when you 're done ( unlike this one ) .	-1
This pump is very slow so unless you have 45 minutes to an hour to pump 4 ounces , do n't get this . In addition to being slow , it began leaking while in use and this is only after being SPARINGLY used for 5 months . It 's a waste of money all around !	-1
I bought this pump before leaving the hospital and it was a waste of money . It hurt like heck and did not express enough milk to relieve my engorgement . The motor cycles very slowly so when it 's tugging on me all I can think is ouch ... ouch ... ouch ... I ended up buying a used Pump-in-Style online and love it . I can pump both sides at once in less than 10 minutes and have a good-sized bottle to show for it .	-1
The advertising for this gate made it seem like the right purchase for me , but I was wrong ! First , the hinges on the gate which allow you to place the panels at an angle are not wonderful . If you 're a little too forceful , it can easily break . And if it breaks , you 're out of luck with installing this gate . Second , the mounting pieces for the wall are fixed position , at the top of every fence panel . The wall mounts are not the same as shown in the Amazon picture , which is in the middle of the panel ! This became a problem for me because I have a window ledge that is lower than the wall mount location . Third , this Kidco gate is clearly terribly overpriced . Most people will have to buy extension gate panels to make this work and boy does the cost add up . If you have an irregular shaped area or room that needs a gate , I 'd recommend that you look into the North States 3 in 1 Super Yard Gate . I bought this North States Gate with a total of 6 panels ( 12 feet ) and it did not have any of the problems I just described . It was expensive , but cost less than the Kidco . Overall , it is sturdier and better made too . The North States Gate can be placed at various angles too just like the Kidco . North States Gate needs to amp up their advertising though because it is n't quite clear that it can do the same as the Kidco Gate at a better price too .	-1
The only good thing about this is the night light function . The waves and water sound horrible and my son never liked listening to the music or the heartbeat sound .	-1
Good while it worked ! My baby really liked the sounds and the night light was great for midnight feedings . I only had it for three weeks when it stop working . I changed batteries thinking that was the problem but the next day it stop working again . It did n't play music and light would not turn off . I am really disappointed . Buyer beware !	-1
I bought this for my 6 week old daughter because the price was nice and the table was attractive . I tried to put it together and I could not figure it out ! It does not seem very sturdy at all and I would be worried putting her on it . I am returning it back to the store . My sister has the same table and her 's is fine . Maybe I just picked up a bad one .	-1
I used this when I became too sore to use my electric pump . The milk seeps under the pump guard and it leaks out from the edges onto clothes . I would n't even say getting this as a pump for when you 're on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up . I had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing ( which it says you can do ) . They do n't sell just that one little piece so I had to buy the actual pump again as a part . It cost nearly $ 30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it . The entire system just is n't durable or made for much use . Also , cleaning down into the bend of this pump thoroughly is practically impossible .	-1
I was hoping for more of a pad feel to make my baby 's mattress softer but this is more like a waterproof cover with some quilting as an afterthought . Did n't make the matress any softer .	-1
Had it not fallen apart after one wash , this would have been the perfect mattress pad . It never even made it into the dryer . What a waste of money .	-1
This was about as thick as his cozy baby blanket . There was nothing & # 34 ; UltraSoft & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; UltraThick & # 34 ; about this mattress pad , if you could call it that . It 's probably the first amazon purchase , after a couple hundred , that really left me disappointed . You 're better off putting a thick , soft blanket under your baby 's crib sheet if padding is what you 're going for . As a mattress protector , it might be good . As a quilted pad to make it softer- it 's useless . The packaging it came in is less than 1.5 inches thick if that gives you any indication as to how thin the entire thing can be folded up to . My 7 month old would n't have even noticed a difference . He naps SO well on our Tempurpedic with a down topper that I wanted to get him a little something to soften his mattress with now that he 's older . Guess I 'll have to keep looking .	-1
When I opened the packaging I was appalled by the strong chemical smell of this mattress pad . I had to open the windows to get rid of the smell in the room even after I wrapped the pad back in plastic . I ca n't imaging my baby being in the same room with this product , let alone sleep on it ! I also realized that there is no need to have a water proof mattress pad because most crib mattresses these days already come in a water proof cover . The non-waterproof cover I got was a much better choice for my baby .	-1
Look through the reviews and you can see many people upset about these leaking . They are correct ! Because it only happens to one in about four or five reviewers , I think there must be a problem with production . Maybe some are leaky , some are not . Fact is , out of ten bottles , five of mine were leaky . I ended up throwing the whole lot out after using more money on paper towels than bottles.Save yourself the headache and get evenflo or playtex . They are half the cost and never leak	-1
Do n't waste your money ! Overpriced leaky bottles !	-1
These worked good for about 3 weeks and they started to leak . I went to the Avent website and they said that I was overtightening the bottles and that was causing the leak . Well less tightening did not help . Do n't waste money . I am using the Playtex Premium Nurser now and it 's much better .	-1
I bought a few Avent bottles when I was at a grocery store and had to have a bottle RIGHT then and this was all they had . I was not disappointed in the quality of the bottle , but I was not overly impressed . I did not notice a change in my son 's spitting up using these bottles , either.The downside of using the Avent system is that , once you commit , you 're really committed - the bottles and bottle parts do not fit standard bottles and parts . I now have a wide variety of bottles and bottle parts , and the Avent bottles sit largely unused because I can not mix and match the parts . Who has time to search for the right parts when their baby is hungry and crying ?	-1
Wanted to use the Avent line , but baby just would n't take this nipple . Went with Playtex ventaire natural instead . Looks like a science lab ... but baby switches easily from breast to bottle .	-1
Avent bottles are not as great as all the write ups . They allow to much air to enter the baby 's system . Spend your money on a better bottle like Dr. Brown 's or Platex . I know several new mother 's who bought in the ad hype about these bottles and ended up trashing them and buying something else .	-1
Do n't bother buying these if you want your baby to take in less air . Go with the Dr. Brown 's . My kids actually ingested more air b/c of the nipple shape - they just could n't get their mouths around the large base.Reasons I give 2 stars : -well-made-easy to clean	-1
My son is breast fed , but we have given him an occasional bottle . He refused these . I got them because of all the great things I heard about them . I thought it would be easier for him to switch back and forth . No chance . He hates them . He hate the Playtex disposables too . He now takes Gerber bottles , traditional and New Traditions .	-1
I had nothing but leakage problems with these bottles . I contacted the company and they told me all these different tips of assembling the bottles that should stop leakage . Needless to say none worked . Luckily for me I was able to return the larger bottles . I am although stuck with eight of the smaller ones . First off let me say when you are sleep deprived you dont ' want to be worrying if the bottle lip has a drop of water on it that will cause it to leak or if you have over tightened or under tightened . There is no time to worry about all these little things when you have a hungry screaming baby . The bottles are by far not cheap and there should n't be so many issues . I have many friends that have said that theirs leaked as well ... too bad they did n't tell me before I registered for them . Oddly enough if you buy a bottle in the .99 cent store you do n't have all these issues . When I returned the larger ones to Babies R US there were a lot of other returns as well . I will give these to my daughters to play with their dolls . In addition to the leakage I noticed that my son was extremely gassy and would cry so much after eating . I have told my friends who are registering now to save their money and find an alternate bottle .	-1
I spent SO much money on these bottles while I was pregnant , because they were supposively the best bottles to use while breastfeeding . The bottles are expensive so I thought they must be good bottles . WRONG . Expensive does not always equal good . I tried using these bottles when my baby was two weeks old , and the feeding session ended in complete frustration on mine AND my baby 's part . The nipple shape is horrible . Even the newborn nipples are WAAAAAY too long for a newborn 's mouth ( and my baby has a BIG mouth . He was 9 lbs at birth ) . Not to mention that these bottles let him suck SOOOO much air and caused him to spit up several times . I thought maybe my baby was just having problems with taking a bottle , so I went and bought the Playtex VentAire . Those bottles are a LOT cheaper and SOOOOOOOOOOOO much better . He took the bottle immediately and did n't get NEARLY the amount of air . Do n't waste your money on these bottles . They are NOT the `` best '' bottles to use while breastfeeding . SO if you are pregnant , do n't make the same mistake that I did and buy a whole load of these bottles thinking that they are the best .	-1
They leak like mad ... and although you tell yourself you must be doing something wrong because no bottle should leak this much , it 's not your fault . It 's these idiotic bottles ! I ca n't imagine how they passed any kind of testing when they were being made . Please do n't buy them , it is a huge waste of money !	-1
These bottles leak . It does n't matter how you assemble them , or if you assemble them wet , or dry , or in space , or in a cave . They leak . Terribly . And Avent knows it . They will even replace your leaky bottles if you call 1800 54avent . Of course the ones they replace it with also leak . Buy Dr. Browns instead .	-1
HI , I HAD THESE BOTTLES BACK IN 2002 WHEN MY SON WAS BORN BECAUSE THE HOSPITAL GAVE THEM TO US TO USE TO FEED THE BABY . I HAD NO PROBLEMS BUT WHEN I BOUGHT MORE WHEN I GOT HOME , I HAD NOTHING BUT LEAKY PROBLEMS ! ! ! I EMAILED AVENT 2 TIMES AND THEY TOLD ME FIRST THAT I HAVE TO CALL THEM TO `` TALK ABOUT IT '' I SAID FORGET IT AND THEN I COMPLAINED AGAIN WHEN THE LEAKING KEPT HAPPENING . THEY SAID THAT I WAS NOT PUTTING THE NIPPLE AND RING ON CORRECTLY . THEY TOLD ME TO ONLY TURN THE RING UNTIL U FEEL IT JUST ATTATCH TO THE BOTTLE AND DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN . I TRIED THIS AND YET AGAIN THE BABY WAS SOAKED ! ! ! MY POINT OF WRITING ABOUT THIS NOW IN 2005 WHEN I USED THESE BOTTLES IN 2002 IS THAT I CAN NOT BELEIVE THIS PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTED YET ! ! ! WE THINK WE HAVE ANOTHER BABY ON THE WAY AND I KNOW THAT WE WILL NOT , NOT , NOT , BE GETTING AVENT BOTTLES ! ! !	-1
Avent bottles have more BPA than any other leading brand . BPA free brands include Born Free , Nurture Pure , MAM , Green to Grow , Baby Life and Adrini . ( For those that missed the news reports - BPA is a chemical found in some plastics that a recent National Institutes of Health report indicated may be harmful , especially to infants . )	-1
These bottles are very finicky and if you do not put them together just right they will leak ... not drip ... POUR out all over the floor , and if it is breast milk that is gushing out of the bottle you may just be crying too ! I ended up with a full set of these bottles ( without the ring ) and one that required the ring ( which I felt leaked less ) , I could never justify going out and buy all new bottles , so I dealt with these for 11 months . I have now weaned my son off of these and onto a sippy cup because I just could not deal any longer ! What 's the trick ? Well , the nipple has these three little lines on it and inside the screw on part there are solid parts and slotted parts ( sorry if this does n't make sense ) . You have to line up the lines on the nipple with the solid parts on the bottle top . This requires two hands , so you will also need to find a place to put down your screaming baby while you concentrate and get it all lined up perfectly . Once you have them lined up , now screw on the top . You have to make sure it is nice and tight . Now , shake it and see ... . it leaks ! It is because when you screw the top onto the bottle the nipple shifts and turns as you screw it on tight , so all that time you spent lining up the holes with the slots is garbage . Take it off and try again . Finally you will get it right and only then can you give the bottle to your starving child.I can not wait to throw them all in the trash .	-1
I have tried five different types of bottles and these are horrible . Do n't waste your money . Dr. Brown 's is the way to go !	-1
Sent me 3 bottles one of which did n't have a lid in the box . Crappy quality control . Just buy them at the store for more money , at least you 'll get all the parts with it . 5 stars for avent , -5 stars for seller .	-1
I recieved boxes of these bottles as gifts , every one of them leaks . I tried everything to stop the leaks , but nothing worked . Avent makes a great manual breast pump , but they need to put a better bottle on the market .	-1
The nipple is so long that my infant was gagging everytime i tried to feed her . It is n't great for infants that are nursing ... My daughter had a fit when i tried to feed her . Not only was she gagging , but she just did n't like the nipple . I used the playtex nurser bottle and she loved it . I have been using those bottles and nipples ever since , and she is doing great when i need to switch from breast to bottle .	-1
I am extremely tired of having to clean up messes after feeding our twin sons with the Avent bottles . Especially if we are out for a big event and the boys are dressed nicely . The bottles worked great for the first six months and then ... ..THEY ALL LEAKED . It was not a small leak rather , a pouring leak that soaked their shirts . I hate these bottles and plan to switch ! ! !	-1
We used Avent bottles for several weeks , but our baby was spitting up _all the time_ , seemed like she was choking during feedings , and had gas all the time . We switched to the Playtex VentAire bottles when she was 6 weeks old , and problem solved ! No more crying from gas , she hardly ever spits up anymore , and she has a much easier time at feedings . The flow is slower and it really does cut down on the amount of air she takes in during feedings . So , I highly recommend trying something other than the Avent bottles for small infants . Maybe later , when our baby is a bit older we 'll pull out the Avent bottles again , but for now , we are n't using anything except Playtex VentAire .	-1
when i became pregnant i planned on using these bottles , i bought everything bottle warmer , sterilizer , breast pump , and a ton of bottles and nipples . well 2 weeks into using them i threw them out the window . my daughter had very bad gas . when i switched bottles the gas stopped . Plus the bottles are expensive ... ... you have to keep buying new nipples there are sooo many different sizes . a waste i think , most bottles have 2 fast or slow but there seemed to be 4 different sizes or more .	-1
These bottles were terrible for us . They leaked no matter how many times I tried and followed the directions . They also did not keep my daughter from being gassy . As soon as we changed her bottles to the Dr. Browns she slept through the night with no wake ups . I was not a big fan of these bottles and neither was my daughter .	-1
My daughter liked the nipple but got to much air . I tried these and the Dr. Brown but ended up going back to Playtex Nursers ( I used these with all my other kids ) I wouldnt recommend these .	-1
These bottles just did n't work for my baby . We tried and tried for 3 and 1/2 months to get my baby to take these bottles but it just did n't work . My baby is mostly breastfed , and is only given a bottle occasionally , so I did n't give up on these bottles right away , just thinking that he was n't used to the bottles and that 's why he was having a tough time . My mom babysat and she has raised nine kids , all who were bottlefed , so she is an expert . She said to me that the baby just really ca n't use this nipple . He chews on it and could n't suck properly , the nipple seemed to hard for him . He could n't latch on right and all the milk would spill out the sides of his mouth . Well , I take anything she says seriously ! After investing alot of time and money in Avent , I decided to scrap them and start over . I went out and found a nipple that was closest to his pacifier that he loves . I found Gerber Nuk nipples , got four of them for about $ 4 and bought Especially for Baby bottles for a whopping $ 2.99 ( you get 3 ) and my baby LOVES them ! ! ! ! THe bottles are cute ( the gerber bottles would be fine , too , but they were n't cute enough ! ) He takes the nipple right away and finally the bottles are emptied in no time . What a relief . I am sure Avent is good for some babies , but not mine , even after months of `` training '' . My advice is to try different bottles before settling on one kind . One more note , I read the other reviews that talk about leaking , I did n't have this problem at all . The only leaking was from my son 's mouth when he could n't latch on properly . But my cousin used Avent and they leaked terribly for her and she switched to Dr Browns . I would have tried Dr Browns but it looks like their bottles have the same nipples as Avent , too hard and not good for my baby . Expensive is n't always better !	-1
When breastfeeding , these are highly recomended . The problem with a breastfeeding mom is , they do not fit standard US breast pumps . So basicly you have to pump into one bottle , then transfer into this one ( this causes a problem for those of us who do n't produce quite enough milk -- - every drop that is lost in transfer is crutial ) . Then you are faced with the leaking problem . The directions say to wet the rim to prevent leaking . Well , sometimes that works and sometimes it dose n't . Again , I am reminded of how delicate every drop of milk was . Sometimes these bottles will taunt you . I would test the bottle before giving it to baby ... then after I was convinced it would n't leak ... baby would begin to suck and would instantly be drownded ! And there you are , wasted milk , and a hungry baby who is drenched , and really mad by the time you get another bottle ready and her clothes changed ! ! ! The day I stopped breast feeding I switched to playtex vent aire , which only leak once in a blue moon , if you dont put it together right .	-1
I choose these bottles because they are very popular but then realized that the size of them are so large that the baby never really seems to be able to get a good hold on them . I started bottle feeding at 6 months and ended up having to switch and buy an entire new line . After my son turned 1 began to wean him off the bottle and introduced the avent bottles again just to see if he could hold it and it was still way to large for him ... .. I guess these bottles would work if you plan on bottle feeding a toddler with big hands	-1
My baby never wanted to take them , or when he did , he looked like he was going to choke ( even with the newborn nipples ! ) , and was doing a mess , with milk dripping everywhere . The Evenflo nipples were cheaper and better .	-1
When my daughter was born we stocked up on these bottles because we heard they were good and the price alone would make you think that . Well after using them for about 2 weeks they started to leak . NOT fun at 3:00 in the morning when you shake up a bottle and there is milk fling around.Even worse is when you are feeding and the milk pours out on baby 's face . Not only do you have to clean up but your baby does n't want to wait for a new bottle . After slowly running out of bottles that did n't leak we decided to go with the Playtex Nursers and liners.These work perfect ! They do n't leak and our baby has less gas . The liners prevent a lot of gas . If you are worried about the cost of liners Target has their own brand that is about half the price . You get 100 of them for maybe $ 5.00 . We have n't had any problems with leaking at all.So I do n't recommend the Avent bottles unless you want to be cleaning up milk all the time . But the other Avent things we have like the sterilizer , warmer , & many other products work just perfectly and would recommend all of them ! So if you want to give these bottles a try because they do get some great reviews then just buy a few at first.We had no luck with the avent bottles but that does n't mean they are all bad . I just had to give a warning so you do n't lose a lot of money like we did .	-1
these dont require that extra ring to make it leak proof . i had the originals and they work great too but i like the big capacity but not big size of these . they will leak out of the nipple if it is upside down so if your baby feeds themselves , watch that they dont drop it and wedge it somewhere upside downupdated review***** i love avent NATURALLY bottles and trusted that is what i was getting when i looked at all 12 customer photos . well i broke these babies out to use em last night and they are reg avent bottles with the stupid ring on the inside that makes it not leak ( something not needed in the other bottle ) the plastic used is also completely different . it isnt the hard clear plastic that doesnt cloud or stain , it is the dull non see through plastic that feels pliable . and the oz numbering on these reg bottles is the kind that will scratch and rub off easily . so disappointed that i now have to return these : (	-1
We got these bottles because they are supposed to be the closest thing to breast feeding , and they advertise a 'slow-flow ' nipple . Needless to say , the milk just ran down our baby 's chin every time . The slow-flow is not slow enough for a baby who is accustomed to breast feeding and having to work at gettimg milk out . They are way too expensive and did n't work well for us .	-1
Baby is breast-fed and I registered for these so I could pump and my husband could feed her at night . Our baby hated the bottle and would n't take the nipple . The nipples , on the Avent , are too long and hard and would make her gag when she attempted to latch on . We switched to the Platex NaturalLatch and now she takes a bottle . The nipples on the Platex are much softer and shorter . Baby switches between the bottle and breast now , no problem .	-1
I found the nipple to be way too hard for my newborn son to suck . I then ran out and got the Munchkin Tri-flow . You can change how fast the milk flows out of the bottle as you baby grows and the nipple is much softer ! Munchkin also sells just the nipple that is compatable with the Avent bottle . So , if you 've already purchased the avent bottles your money has not gone to waste ! The only problem is that the Tri-flow is still fairly new and is very hard to find ! Good Luck !	-1
I bought this to use with my Avent bottles ( which by the way LEAK ) and I was very disappointed . My doctor told me to pump to stimulate my milk production which was coming in slowly . I could not get very much with this and needless to say it was not helping . Once I started using a Medela Electric pump , I got tons of milk ! I was skeptical about the price , but it 's totally worth it if you want to be able to use a pump on a regular basis .	-1
I based my decision to purchase this pump based on all the reviews it got . However , it takes me about 20 minutes to pump 4 ounces.. on a good day ! ! Luckily , I have an awesome boss , who allows me all the time I need to pump.. I average 2-3 ounces every hour and half.. at 20 minutes at a time.. which is rediculous . If I could , I would purchase an electric pump , because as my baby grows , I do n't see how I 'd be able to catch up to her growing appetite using this pump , and not spend my whole day in the bathroom pumping . On the plus side.. all the litle extras it came with are great , and the case is discreet and keeps the bottles cold for a few hours .	-1
I had NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO idea.. ! ! ! I only recieved this pump - no electrical one and I wanted 2 diiiiie ! I was in pain for days after I gave birth , irritable because of the lost of sleep and trying to conform to the babies temporary sleeping pattern . I had a low milk supply and breastpumping for 1 hour for only 4ounces - this was not a joke ! I wanted 2 diiiie I tell you.. I would finish pumping and da baby would be getting up for a feeding ... NOooooo ! already , I would think ... yes and with only 4 oz to show . Here I go with the stupid MANUEL pump ... NO.. I NOW know better ... . electronic and a good brand- so what you pay 300. and change its worth your sanity , sleep , time , energy and appreciation for the bond with the baby . My milk supply in time grew ( not soon enough ) I am still nursing and again the manuel pump and I did NOT have a good relationship . We started off badly	-1
I love the Advent line & highly recommend their bottles & microwave sterilizer , but this breast pump is awful ! The prong that connects to the handle , which creates the vacuum to pull the milk out , consistently becomes unlatched breaking the vacuum so you have to fix it and start all over . The only reason it got a two stars rating was because the pump handle does fit extremely well on the bottles and everything fits in the bag nicely .	-1
If you are only going to be pumping once in a blue moon , then this is a great pump for you . I found it to be an incredible nusance , so I borrowed a friend 's Medela electric pump . Never used this Back to Work pump more than twice after using hers ! Why spend a longer amount of time pumping that you have to ( and yes it does take longer even though the manual says their stats say otherwise ) . With our next child , I will definitely be buying electric !	-1
The instructions that came with this are terrible . The diagrams are really tiny and have no labels . The written instructions for Step 1 say `` see the diagram '' and do not elaborate , making the instructions worthless . The 3M sticky tape is REALLY sticky . Do not expect to get it off your furniture or to reuse these edge guards - the tape will cling to your furniture and to the guards , destroying both.In the end I was unable to install my guards properly - they attached to the furniture crookedly and then I could n't un-stick them in order to make it right . The guards are nice , thick foam , but that does n't matter if the installation goes miserably.You can see my photos of the final results I got in the Customer Image Gallery .	-1
The title says it all ... the edges of the bumpers were very tempting for my daughter to peel every chance she got . You 'd think her ability to remove the ends of the bumpers would indicate the bumpers would be easy to remove.They were a nightmare and have ruined our beautiful coffee table . I 've tried goo gone to no avail . If anyone has any tips how to get the tape off , which is coated with random pieces of foam from the old bumpers , I 'd love to hear them . I ca n't believe how awful my table looks .	-1
We put this on our coffee table six months ago , all but one of the corners have fallen off repeatedly . The long strips dont really protect my child much . She will still bump into the table at times and it doesnt offer much cushion . It is not really thick enough or wide enough . Corners are a joke . The tape provided is not sticky enough . Just keeps coming off .	-1
I do n't understand why they would make a product that does not fit standard corner tables ! I need to return this item	-1
Good idea but this is very cheaply made ... it is not sticky enough to stay on anything ... my 6 month old baby would just yank it off immediately . I wish I never purchased this because you 'd basically have to crazy glue to your furniture and there 's no way I am doing that !	-1
You know when you 're child free and buy great furniture ? You ca n't fathom the day when you 'll have to apply foam to your beautiful wood table so your child does n't go head first into the sharp corner ? Those days are now a distant memory and you bite the bullet and apply a foam guard . Then you go to take it off because your child has spilled parmesan cheese and ... what ... the ? The wood came off . The WOOD came off . I expected to have to use some Goo-Be-Gone to get off the adhesive but this actually destroyed the table . Not like a dent that could be sanded . I piece of wood literally splintered off . So , while this product will protect your kid 's noggin , do n't put it on a piece of furniture you like .	-1
This product does not adhere well . I have tried it on wood , metal , and painted surfaces . What 's more , other `` safety '' products I have purchased that use well-known 3M tape were defective as well . Also , when I tried to remove the cushion , the tape removed my furniture paint . Overall , I rate this item with 2 stars because the neutral color does not attract my toddler 's attention and the cushion does prevent painful head bumps .	-1
When you first put this on the table you feel like it has made things safer for your child , however the first time they get near it they are able to pull it off because the adhesive provided with it does n't hold well unless you have a completely flat surface to attach it to . ( I suppose if you use a stronger adhesive you would run the risk of damaging the table ) .Only buy if you have a large top face and edge to the table with no decorative surface changes ( must be completely flat to hold at all )	-1
This is the worst thing ever . It sticks for one week and then its down . I put in on my coffe table and end tables and they are all damage because of the tape.Do n't buy it	-1
I love how soft and cuddly this changing pad cover is . I also appreciate how many colors it comes in.What I am disappointed with is the durability . I have 3 of these and have used them for just over a year . They are totally falling apart at the elastic . Now , keep in mind that we use disposable `` chucks '' ( those blue hospital disposable under pads ) on top of this terry cloth changing pad . It makes it less messy ( especially early on ) and does n't require washing as much . I also washed them in cold water with Baby Dreft detergent , hung them to dry and rotated the 3 covers that we have.While it is a nice product while it lasts , I just expected them to be more durable .	-1
After only a few uses and washes , this pad cover started to tear . It was ripping in the corners , and no matter how gentle I was , the hole got bigger.The color choice is out standing . . .however I just wish that it had held up a bit better for us .	-1
Great colors , and I like Simmons ' contoured changing pad , which this is supposed to fit , but keep in mind that washing will significantly shrink the covers & amp ; the terry fabric does n't hold up well . After just a couple of months , ours are already coming apart .	-1
Washed it once according to directions & it shrunk beyond belief ! Did n't even use it once ! Do n't bother ! ! !	-1
do not waste your moneyi got it and i tried with 2 strollers the same exact one but it would not work goodyou can not move that much and its hard to make a turn ... ...	-1
These do n't stick at all ! My guys ripped them off the sides of the tables the second we put them up . The adhesive would n't restick either . What a waste . : (	-1
They do n't seem to stick very well . Also , once they did start to come off , I noticed it was leaving that sticky residue behind on my coffee table .	-1
it never worked , i cleaned the surface and followed direction ... failed.tried with double sided tape ... failed.tried with regular tape ... . failed.i think the problem is that it 's not smooth again the surface on top , so it creates a little gap and easily falls off .	-1
This item is not top quality . I do n't have too many of this company 's other products , so if this is an example of their quality than I do n't think I will . First off the cover does not open without popping off the hinge and needing to be reattached , the batteries only lasted through two cd 's , the volume does n't get very high , and it does n't even fit on the side of our crib . Being in the baby business they should know that not all crib 's are made the same . You are much better off just getting a simple boom box that play 's cd 's .	-1
could not even try it it did n't fit on our crib . looks like a good idea .	-1
What a disappointment ! We were so grateful to receive this at a baby shower- it was something we really wanted . However , it did not live up to expectations . The sound quality was awful- very , very quiet even on the highest volume setting and , even worse , extreme static . I exchanged it for another one thinking that maybe the first was defective but had the same problems . For such an expensive item the quality is very poor.We ended up ordering the Fisher Price Tape Player online and it is really wonderful . We love it- buy it instead , better quality and cheaper !	-1
I thought this would be a great idea . So when we found out we were having twins i ran out and bought 2 of them . We started to put the nurserys together and when it came time to put these on they wouldnt fit . I didnt want to stratch the crib rails up so we took them back . When we did try to play a cd in them it skipped . We ended up just buying small cd/radio players for each of their room because this is something they can both use for a long time .	-1
While I think it 's a great fit for the toilet , my daughter wo n't sit on it for more than a couple minutes , having to adjust every few seconds because she says it & # 34 ; is n't comfy & # 34 ; . After the great reviews and was actually recommended to me by my sister , it just does n't work for our daughter . I 'm going to have to buy a cheap padded one I guess . Stinks that I ca n't return this thing . Pretty expensive .	-1
Works well , but you basically need to also buy the steps that go with it or your kid can not get on the potty by themselves.. which is the point . To be honest we have the mini potty by baby bjorn and it is simpler and the kids can do it all on their own ... so this might be good for someone to use in a second bathroom where they do not want to have a little potty sitting around . You can easily hide it behind the toilet ...	-1
Bought two based on a lot of the good reviews , one for our upstairs and downstairs bathrooms . The splash guard can hurt your son . Also the splash guard does n't work to keep the pee from shooting out from under the seat . If you have a girl it might be for you , if you have a boy do n't get this seat . Make sure you read the other reviews about boys and this potty seat . Also the seat is bulky and very annoying to get it to fit each time . This potty seat has discourage our son from wanting to use the potty . If anyone who has had a hard time potty training their kids this will make it so much harder ! !	-1
I didnt know you had to lift the seat up to use this . there is a rubber thing inthe back that stops you from placing it on the seat itself , you need to lift up the seat and place it on the dirty part of the rim ... .all b/c of that stupid rubber thing in the back . I evem tried cutting it off , but it still doesnt help . this was a poor design .	-1
Love the company but this trainer does not fit a round toilet and seat . ( We have a Toto with a Bemis seat . ) This is not entirely clear in the product description , so I hope this review helps others avoid the hassle of ordering and returning .	-1
We have a standard size and shape toilet seat . Yet , this potty seat fits the seat in an awkward manner , causing pee to leak both on top and under the front of the toilet seat . Granted , I have little boys , so maybe this is n't so much of a problem with girls.We had MUCH better luck with the Mommy 's Helper Cushie Tushie potty seat ( the one with the ducks on it ) , which is , incidentally , much cheaper and easier to clean . The same unfortunate pee situation never happens with that seat .	-1
Though this is a nice sturdy potty seat and would probably be perfect for girls or larger boys , it did not work for me . My son has to hoist himself off and on the potty as he is not yet tall enough to rest his feet on the foot stool while using it . The pee guard is so large that I was seriously concerned about his `` equipment '' being damaged in the process of trying to stand up . I recommend the Arm and Hammer potty seat over this ( much cheaper too ) .	-1
I bought it based on so many great reviews . I wonder if I am the only one who was not able to attach it to the existing toilette seat . The description says `` adjusts easily and sits firmly in place '' ... well , it does not . It slides right out of the existing seat . SO I basically keep in there not attached at all and have to sit my child and remove him from there , otherwise the seat falls out .	-1
I 'm surprised by how well this is rated so I decided to add my two cents to the minority.The PROS : Fits snugly on any seat . We have round and elongated and it fits both no problem . Also , easy to clean . I also like the look of it ; simple and clean . I put one in the guest bathroom and I can leave it there when I have people over.The CONS : By the time you get the seat cover up , the pants down , the seat on and plop you kid on the toilet he 's already pee 'd hisself.The slashguard - after watching my sons try to get up from it on there own I quickly realized they might end up eunuchs . Even with the stool and me standing there it is still dangerous ; they have to be lifted . When they try to maneuver around it , the seat becomes dislodged from putting there weight on one side . I was horrified to hear that some boys actually pulled their skin open and needed stitches . I was even more appalled by some reviewers saying that the parents should have been more vigilant . With all the worry and guilt inherant in parenting thats just a mean thing to say ; and not trure . The whole point of potty training is to get your child to go on their own . They ca n't learn if you are hovering every time.I bought the built in toilet seat instead . There are two seats in one so both children and adults can use it .	-1
My daughter is on the thinner side and at 18 months struggles to get comfortable in this chair . She 's not able to sit on it without falling in . There 's no way that she could sit on this for any length of time because she 's having to hold her weight so she does n't fall in . In addition , the splash guard makes sitting on this super awkward . Another mother wrote about how her daughter needed stitches after cutting her genitals on the splash guard . I can totally see how this can happen . It 's not safe for your child to independently seat themselves without some help .	-1
I ordered this potty because after weeks of research , this was the only potty I could find that 's BPA free . When it came my daughter was excited to try it . Unfotunately she pinched her finger on the pull out center . She also voiced that her bottom hurt because it was too hard . She 's only 25 lbs and is a small girl but there is n't enough seat so it 's uncomfortable . She now refuses to sit on it . It 's going back .	-1
So we have been using this potty seat for several months now trying to get our daughter used to going on the potty . I bought this one because it had great reviews and was simple and easy to clean . But every time we put her on it , after only a few minutes she starts complaining that her feet hurt . What she means is that her feet are tingling and going to sleep . Then she does n't want to get off because her legs are numb and she gets scared . She is not a big girl but this seat is just too uncomfortable for her . Also , every time she gets up the insert sticks to her behind and will dump if there is anything in it . It also leaves her with a red ring around her butt . I am going to look for a cushioned potty chair next and hopefully we have more success .	-1
This is a basic potty with the pot that can be removed for easy cleaning so it 's easy to wash and clean but my poor kid stands up from sitting on this for mere minutes and has deep red marks on her legs and bottom , it 's uncomfortable ! I 'm going to order one with a cushy seat !	-1
looks cute but not functional for us.the depth of the plastic bowl is not deep.If the shit is coming out long and hard , it might push back up to the baby	-1
My son is 50th percentile for weight and height , so pretty average sized for a 2 year old . As lots of reviewers have mentioned , the height of this potty is great , the handholds on the side are a help , the splash guard is built in so there are no pinching problems there , and the back WOULD be nice except ... There is about an inch of space between the edge of the bowl and the back of the seat , so that when my son sits on it , the bowl shifts ever so slightly and his bum gets pinched in the back . The reviews have been so positive on the no-pinching thing that I was stunned by this . Even when he does not get pinched , he also ends up with seams cut into his little bum and back of legs , and as a result will not remain seated on this seat at all . Therefore I can not comment whether the pee goes into the bowl , because we never get that far.As far as disinfecting , I thought it would be really easy -- just pull the bowl out , dump it out , wipe , disinfect with clorox on occasion ... BUT several times poop has gotten under that back edge of the bowl , necessitating a cleaning of the rest of the seat as well , which is just a pain.Finally , the bowl is way too light and often sticks to my son 's legs and he stands up.I can not say , however , if there is anything better out there -- we have n't found the `` perfect '' potty yet , but if this is the best of the portable potties , I guess we 're going to have to go with the seat insert for our toilet , because this has turned out to be virtually worthless to us .	-1
I bought this for potty training my 2-year old daughter but she would n't use it . However , all kids are different in their potty training likes/dislikes , so I 'm only saying it did n't work for us . She preferred using the seats that go on top of your normal toilet seat or the type of potty chairs that had a lid to close . She liked the idea of closing the potty lid .	-1
I 'm surprised this potty got such rave reviews . My daughter is so uncomfortable with this potty trainer ! She 'll sit on it , but it 's so small . The splash guard is what really seems to make it uncomfortable for her . She 's accidental sat on it before and it hurt her . When she sits on it the splash guard makes her have to sit with her legs open , but as I mentioned the seat is pretty narrow so she ca n't really sit on it comfortably .	-1
I 'm really surprised at the 5 star reviews for this potty chair . If I had back all the time I have spent cleaning pee up off the floor I would be so happy . The splash guard is way too short , my son just pees right over the top of it . I do like the separate potty and it 's easy to clean but I still have to clean the whole chair because it simply does n't hold in the pee stream . Ugh . I 'm retiring it as soon as I get a different potty chair . MESSY .	-1
I bought this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews . I was pretty disappointed over all . My daughter is tall for her age but not particularly chunky or chubby . In any case , every time she stood up from this potty chair she also brought a red mark from the circular opening on her bum . I thought it was a little narrow for her . Sometimes when she stood up , the white part actually came up with her . I personally did not think this was a great potty chair . I think this might be because I have a girl and not a boy , since there seems to be issue with other potty 's splash guards . In my case , my daughter did not find this seat comfortable and did not take to it at all . I later bought her that Fisher Price one with the face and that sings . It 's a little lower , but wider and the seat can not come up with her . She loves the songs , though it 's lower and it is actually wider , so even though she is tall , no problems . Again , do n't have a boy so ca n't speak to the splash guard issue , but really this potty is nothing out of this world for me . It 's collecting dust in my hallway closet right now .	-1
I bought this because of the excellent reviews , so I felt it necessary to add my review that is not as positive.My son is 3'3 '' & 30 pounds . ( he is almost 3 yr old ) He does fit on this potty , but it leaves horrible red marks in his inner thighs after only sitting on it a few minutes . It hurt his bottom so badly that he cried & said `` oh mommy my legs ! '' It 's not great to start potty training with a painful experience . He is now afraid of it.I do n't know if my son just has very sensitive skin or if it 's because he is too big for the chair , but I switched to a soft seat that goes on the big toilet & we are trying that now . I would n't recommend this potty for larger children .	-1
Great when my son was sitting down ... now that he stands ... junk . If not right on target , you 're going to have a mess every time . Think pee puddle under the chair ... and now imagine the smell . Totally gross , and getting rid of ASAP.Skip .	-1
This was the second potty we bought for our son , who is almost 3 . In one word - horrible . I had a lot of hope that , with all the excellent reviews , we 'd find success with this one . The basic issue is the splash guard , which really does n't work at all . Pee still goes everywhere . I 'd love to find one of the old-fashioned potties with the high cupped splash guard - but that 's nearly impossible . If I had known that this potty would be no better than others I 've tried , I would have saved my money .	-1
