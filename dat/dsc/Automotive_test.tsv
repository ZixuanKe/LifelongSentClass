With tailgate thefts on the rise around the country , you really just ca n't do without this . But you have a factory tailgate lock you say ? Guess what ? Those can easily be punched out ! Do yourself a favor and buy this lock so your tailgate can not be lifted off easily , and leave your tailgate lock unlocked so they wo n't be tempted to punch it thinking they will get the gate , only to find out you have this other lock .	1
Do n't know if anyone 's tried to steal my tailgate ( I leave my truck parked outside my house in a upper-middle class neighborhood ) , but for the price and ease of install , this would seem to fit the bill . Have only had it for several months , so time will tell how durable this product is ...	1
Product came well packaged , and the instructions were easy to follow.Installation only took a few minutes with the easy instructions.Strongly recommended .	1
A little pricey ... but just cool as crap ! Very simple idea ... why did n't I think of that kind of thing . No one gets my tailgate without a torch !	1
Why would anyone spend $ 15 to lock their tailgate on their truck ? After all the truck came with a tailgate lock from the factory . The OEM factory locks will keep honest people from taking a tailgate , but if the bad guy wants it all it takes is a hit from a screw driver and punch the lock out . Then simple walk away with your tailgate.This master lock is all metal construction , well built , fits perfect , provides the needed security at a bargain price . If you want to remove your tailgate simply use the key to unlock the Master lock and proceed to remove your tailgate.With replacement tailgates costing up to and over $ 3,200 to replace , the price of this lock is darn out right cheap . Will this $ 15 investment have saved me from having to pay my deductible ? I wo n't ever know now that I have it . On the other hand I no longer have concerns about parking my truck and coming back to a missing tailgate.Make the investment and think of it as a one time insurance payment for your tailgate .	1
it was so easy to install . Great price too . hopefully enough of a deterrent to stop the casual criminal ... .for the rest ... if I am there or near by , I have Glock 19 with 15 rounds that I can empty quickly . if I am not there , I have insurance .	1
This only takes seconds to install , I did not even know these locks existed until I purchased locking lugs for my jeep . Definitely worth the price to protect your tailgate from theft . Others shown are plastic and easy to break , this one is medal .	1
I installed this on my 2009 F150 . It 's a fancy padlock that 's just barely wide enough to secure my tailgate . I have n't stuck the fuzzy velcro pads to it yet since I have n't taken a close enough look to see the best place to mount it . I ca n't hear it rattling when I drive . I 'll probably just take a section of old bicycle inner tube and wrap it with that .	1
Recently in Texas and in my neighborhood there has been a big doom in tailgate robberies . I did n't get hit but , neighbors of mine did . This item was easy to install and I feel as though my truck tail gate is protected .	1
Nicely done gaskets often found to be one of the most elements neglected in an oil change which provide extra security in sealing the drain plug .	1
These are Genuine Toyota parts at a decent price . Not much else to say about these . They are oil plug gaskets	1
What 's not to like ? You should use a fresh gasket at every oil change , and these are inexpensive enough to make that happen . Just do n't lose the other 4 in the interim ... I keep the bag taped to the top of my toolbox .	1
Use this on a 1992 Camry 2.2 . Used these in place of a plastic washer . Works great and will be buying more in the future .	1
They are what they 're supposed to be ! They seem to do be doing their job and seal like they 're designed to . Not much more to say about a drain plug gasket . They appear to be genuine Toyota gaskets .	1
You ca n't go wrong with oem parts although it was a pain getting the old one off , it does its job nothing special about gasket , cheap and filled my order	1
This pack should be a money saver because I keep cars for a long time . The gaskets fit right on the drain plug of my 2011 Toyota Sienna minivan . I like the rubber over metal design for a good seal .	1
Like it says , it 's a OEM Toyota part ( s ) ! I replace the crush washer every time I change the oil in my 2009 Camry SE V-6 , so it is nice to see a pack of 10 washers . My local dealership wanted $ 2 each for these same ones , that is crazy ! Buy them in bulk , you wo n't be sorry !	1
Just changed my oil and this fits perfectly into the oil drain plug for my Scion Xb 2006 . I would reccomend this product ,	1
I sometimes get 2 oil changes out of the drain gasket but at this price I 'll change them at each change.Oh , yeah , they work fine .	1
These are genuine Oil Drain Plug Gaskets for Toyota cars . The size for this gasket is 12 mm and they fit perfectly for my Prius oil drain plug bolt .	1
to save money , i only replace this washer/gasket every other oil change or unless the oldone look bad and bent . fit and performed just like the one came with the car .	1
here you get the same item as from the dealer but for a cheaper price . Any soft metal or even plastic or rubber gasket will stop any leaks , but these look and feel nicer . It 's a reassuring feeling to know you 've replaced this during your oil changes .	1
I am a retired auto mechanic who still performs a lot of my own work . Easiest maintenance any owner can perform is an oil change . I use synthetic oil and premium filters and have always replaced the `` crush '' drain plug washer . I have used several different styles of washers : a stainless steel washer that is similar to spark plug washers , nylon washers , fiber washers and aluminum washers . These washers appear to be the aluminum style with a coating on each side that helps seal the drain plug and oil pan surfaces . I feel these are inexpensive insurance against drain plug leaks and replace the washer on every oil change .	1
I try to always use only Genuine Toyota parts on my 1997 Toyota 4Runner ( see my videos on Youtube under RedonKiLaus ) . On my last oil change , the dealer was out of gaskets - but now I have enough for 10 oil changes . That 's probably about 5 years for me since this truck is n't driven every day .	1
They work great , but I was having a hard time finding them locally . Amazon came thru again and I have a supply that will last me quite awhile . They were a little on the expensive side , but it was well worth it , because they were delivered to my door step and I did n't have to run all over to find them .	1
Have been using Toyota/Lexus replacement parts in my 2011 Lexus RX350 since I got it . Do my own oil changes so no need to see the dealership . In fact , have n't seen them for years cause nothing goes wrong with the rest of this SUV . Love saving the extra cash and I get to play with my tools at the same time ! ! ! !	1
They 're the gaskets that go to my car . They do their job . Not sure what else I can say about them .	1
bought these to do oil changes on my lexus es350 myself . they work great and area a great deal for the DIYer .	1
Need to purchase these separately to do an oil change . In my opinion a part like this costing pennies to manufacture should be included with the oem filter cartridge kit . Thus the one star deduction .	1
These are genuine Toyota parts , and they 're supposed to fit on not only the engine oil drain plug but also the differential and transfer case plugs . Most people do n't replace those gaskets , but I do , and I recommend you spend the few extra cents it 's going to cost for the peace of mind it offers knowing you 've replaced a gasket .	1
I love these things ! ! It is an absolute 100 % must have for any pickup truck owner ! ! ! Easy to install . First one I had for my old truck took me 30min to install . The parts are very specific so read the instructions completely before installing . The second one I installed on my new F250 went even faster . I was done in 20min if that long.These tailgates in the full sized pickups are heavy ! My wife can now open the tailgate and not have to worry about trying to catch it or me worrying about her NOT catching it . LOL A simple pull of the latch and the tailgate drops down in slow motion . Closing the tailgate is not affected at all . The tailgate lifts up and closes as it always did . So if you think it is going to make it easier to close ... no it does not do that . It just catches the tail gate as it opens to make it a simple 1 handed operation . I do n't plan on buying a new truck for a long time . But if I do I will order one of these immediately .	1
I got one of the original designs and after about a year of relatively moderate use it rusted and failed . Manufacturer replaced immediately now questions asked . The second one is much more durable and works great .	1
Bought this product because it just makes sense , a truck tail gate is just plain dead weight . the install was good and straight forward . When you first close the gate and then reopen the gate ( hold on as usual ) it falls down except for the last may be 8 inches then it coasts down . The weight of pressure is not printed on the DEE ZEE shock , 30 more lbs of pressure would be Better . But the product does work , it helps on that last few inches on drop . I like it .	1
Dee Zee had to replace the nutsert that came with the package . It would not tighten down . Got a replacement from the excellent service support from Dee Zee . The replacement worked perfectly . Got it all installed and it works great . Would have been 5 stars except for the nutsert that had to be replaced.Installed on my 2013 F350 DRW .	1
Whenever I get in front of one of & # 34 ; those & # 34 ; kinds of people , I love it . Me expressing how dumb their stick family is haha	1
I 've got a couple similar constructed items on the back of my car , but this one is my favorite . Installation was a breeze , I had no problems either getting the first backing off to stick to my car , or the second backing off that left it on my car.Very clean cuts for both the letters and the figures , and it sticks perfectly . I love passing mini vans with the family stick figures on them and getting in front of them so they can see this . Fun to see their faces in the rearview mirror . : )	1
I love this design , not too big , and fitted on to my passenger front side window just perfectly . Sure to get many laughs	1
Got this for the wife a little while back , and she loves it . It looks like it belongs right on the back of her van .	1
The decal is as illustrated , no profanities as the title may suggest.These are really easy to apply if you follow the instructions.Starting with a CLEAN surface.First rub the sticker with a plastic card ( credit card will do ) to ensure the image is pressed firmly on to the application paper.Next , peel back the backing paper to reveal the decal stuck to the application paper in reverse . Pull the backing paper off slowly , you 'll have the backing paper doubling back on itself as you pull it backwards . Be careful if it is windy , you do n't want the decal to fold and stick to itself.Position the decal on the window at one side ( the bottom works best so you can ensure it is straight ) . Then use the credit card to smooth out the decal.Any minor bubbles can be smoothed out , and any that are left will disappear the next time it gets hots from the sun.These look really good .	1
I love this decal . I have one on each of my two cars . My wife tells me she constantly gets dirty looks on the road by others with a back windshield filled with a stick figure family . She sometimes passes cars that have them just to see if they react in the rear view mirror and to her amusement they do . Even people without the stick figure family get a good laugh out of this decal . While driving home one day a cop pulled along side me and asked me to roll down my window and to my amazement , asked me where I purchased the decal as he wanted to put one on his personal vehicle because he stated his wife had gotten carried away with putting stick figures on her car . Installation was breeze as the instructions were detailed and on point . Take your time and it will come out great . I would also like to mention , the decal has lasted numerous car washes and bad weather .	1
very nice bulbs - really crisp lighting at night - slightly smaller connection points , but were easily adapted by snugging up the connections in the light fixture in the car - strongly recommended !	1
Some light replacement . Way brighter and much cooler white light . Easy to put in . Just slide in and aim . You wo n't be sorry	1
Installed these in my 05 tahoe as previous other led bulbs started to flicker out . This bulb is bright , after replacing all my interior lights with leds these replaced interior dome light and back cargo area light . These are great and they have heat sinks on back which are a plus also .	1
The Bosch blade was easy to install and it did a great job while driving in heavy rain and wind gusts condition . They are as good and effective after 10 days of use as they were on day one.Each blade comes with clear installation instructions right on the packaging and I believe that I had it all done in less than one minute which is something given that I 'm a little rusty when it comes to replacing wiper blades . Depending on how long-lasting these are , I 'm likely to get the same make and model for a replacement but only time will tell .	1
I 've been using Toyota wiper blades for the past two years and noticed they dont ' hold up past around six months . I have read that blades need changing every six months and that seems to me like it 's pretty often . The dealer 's prices are higher than if I bought them here so from now on I will buy my wiper blades on Amazon . And I 've always used Bosch until I got this Toyota , and go to the dealer because there for everything because it 's nearby.I 've gotten lazy.But I know Bosch wiper blades last longer than six months because they are the only brand I 've ever used . I am a car person . I have had lots of old cars that I 've restored and Bosch is the only brand I know . And they are silent . I do n't like to hear the wipers on the windshield , scraping it.I was delighted to get some Bosch wiper blades and can highly recommend them .	1
We have been using this wiper for several weeks , and have been pleased with the performance of these blades . They keep the window clear even during the heaviest rains , and we have not experienced any streaks . Sunday we were forced to travel over 100 miles in severe thunderstorms , and these blades made it possible.They are easy to install and nicely made . Two thumbs up - one from my husband and one from me .	1
The Bosch 26-CA fits my 2004 Dodge Durango driver 's side windshield wiper . Unlike conventional wipers . Beam wipers are made to `` hug '' the windshield and not allow debris , weather elements such as rain , snow or ice interfere with its smooth , streak-free and quiet wipes . They offer a more lower profile and the springs are completely concealed , so no more leafs getting stuck in your wipers.They are aerodynamic so that means less wind lift and they actually use the wind to increase the downward pressure and contact on your windshield . Once you try a Beam blade wiper like the Bosch Clear Advantage , you will never go back to a conventional wiper again .	1
About a week after picking up these Bosch Clear Advantage wiper blades for my truck , we had the opportunity to put them to the test . While most of the country was enjoying warm autumn weather , we had a storm front of sleet and snow here in northern Minnesota . The days we do n't get sleet , we 've been having rain.My husband has issues with squeaky windshield wipers . They bother him so much , he will just drive with low visibility rather than use wipers when they squeak . To him , the sound is as bothersome as nails on a black board is to others . Even the slightest squeak gets to him , so I had my fingers crossed these new blades would n't make any sounds . After removing the old blades and easily installing these Bosch Clear Advantage blades , we were elated to find they are whisper quiet . They were a perfect fit on our 2003 Ford F-150.They 've done a great job of wiping away the rain , sleet and slushy snow we 've had so far this year . They go on easily and are a great fit . Keep in mind that there is only 1 wiper blade in each package , so if your vehicle requires two blades of the same size , you will need to order 2 of these . Fortunately Amazon offers a Part Finder tool for automotive products , so you can enter in the make , model and year of your vehicle , and check to make sure the product you 're buying is a match for your auto . You can use this tool to find exactly what size Bosch wiper blades are needed to fit your vehicle . Some vehicles require two blades of the same size , others require 2 blades that are each a different size . If you 're uncertain what your vehicle requires , use this tool and it will identify what exactly you need to buy to achieve the perfect fit .	1
I 've been purchasing the Bosch Icon wiper blade for several years , but this looks to be almost the same quality and is for all-weather condition , and it 's almost half the price of the Icon . Been very pleased with the Icons , but as everyone else I need to save where money . Only negative I can give is it does n't have the cover to hides the attachment to the wiper arm , but that 's just cosmetic and so far it clears my windshield in one-swipe ... only time will tell if they last as long as the Icon version .	1
Would highly recommend especially for MDX car people , its fits , works and looks like the OEM wiper blades that came with the car . Installation is easy . Would highly recommend again , as I said before .	1
These single point attachment blades are great , forget the cheap ones that have several attachment points , those eventually streak . These have constant pressure over the whole blade . I love them .	1
I did n't like my previous Bosch Icon blades . They always seemed to streak . Switching it out with this cheaper blade , so far this one seems to be working much better , plus it 's cheaper . The connectors on the Icon seem a bit nicer , but the clear advantage went on very easily and still seems as secure as any other blade . Hopefully the performance of this blade will hold up better than the Icon did .	1
these seem to work well , but we 'll have to see about longevity . they do n't have the metal arm , but the newfangled plastic system thats SUPPOSED to hold the wiper down and last over time . new they attach and work well - the lack of metal arm makes me nervous . good reviews by others , but let 's see if it will stand up for the year .	1
Used this on my Honda Accord passenger side . Removing my old wiper was tougher than putting on this new one . But be careful when mounting it on - there 's a plastic module in the center that can fall off rather easily ! At first I thought I had broken something , but then I realized it 's like that by design . Seems rather cheap.Once I mounted it okay , it worked very well . The blade is curved in such a way that it hugs the windshield well.I 've used this now in heavy rain and in light rain . In both cases it cleans the windshield very well and makes very little noise . In light rain is when I used to have issues with the old wipers ( it would make lots of noise ) . But not so with these wipers .	1
These Bosch Clear Advantage Beam wiper blades were easy to install . They pretty much just click into place . The wiper blades seem to be well constructed out of good quality materials . They also look very durable . They function well giving streak-free glass . Overall , these are great blades at a great price . I would recommend them .	1
Over the years my replacement wipers of choice has been Bosch Micro Edge . I have found that the Bosch Clear Advantage Beam wiper blades to be superior to those wipers . They fit perfectly on my 2012 Infiniti G37 . They also do an excellent job clearing the windshield .	1
This Bosch 17-CA Clear Advantage Wiper Blade works very well on the passenger side of my 2000 Chevy Caviler . This was my first time personally replacing wiper blades on this car but it was a very quick and painless process.Once installed , the wiper blade did a great job keeping the window clear in the very heavy rain we had the day after I put them on . Since I only put the new blade on the passenger side , it was clear that this is works better than the 4 month old one on the driver side ( not sure of the brand Jiffy-Lube put on it ) so I will by buying theBosch 22-CA Clear Advantage Beam Wiper Blade - 22 '' to even it up.Recommended ! CFH	1
I have to admit it is hard for me to get excited about any product having to do with my car . But , this wiper works just like it should . It installs easily and works like a charm in rain . It has n't snowed yet , but it works very well in the rain .	1
There is nothing wrong with this product . It is overpriced so I took off one star.Installation is as expected	1
DifferentThe Bosch wiper blades use the new design that is replacing the old one . The wiper arm and blade are one piece . Bosch uses a bracketless wiper design , and other manufacturers are doing the same . The arm has a built-in spring and also a flat rubber blade attached as one piece . The arm is curved to distribute tension evenly so it gets the whole middle of the windshield just as well as it clears the area above the pivot.Advantages*The wipe is smooth , especially compared against the other comparably-priced wipers in the category like the ones I 've got in the past . *It 's got a new kind of fastening mechanism that more easily clips on and off . The goodness of this is ease of changing blades more frequently . *Supposed to be 40 % longer-lasting , since it 's got almost no moving parts unlike standard blade arms . *Supposed to be quite - although I did n't notice significant noise difference.Reasons not to get this wiper blade*If it 's worth spending a little more to get the Bosch Icon blades , which use two types of rubber ( `` dual rubber process '' - hard rubber for wiping and soft rubber for flexing ) . *If the purpose includes frequent off-road heavy duty including for mud.Summary : The blade design is excellent . The blades have good value and are easy to change .	1
When I first looked up the size for my Saturn SL2 , I found that the chart said a 20 inch size would work well for the passenger side . When I went to the Bosch site , I found that it was recommended to get the 21 inch and I got upset . I had already ordered the 20 inch size.The great news is that the wiper already on my car was 20 inches and this one fits and works beautifully . The 21 inch would be too big anyway . It was tricky to install at first , and despite being plastic in construction , it goes on well and so far has stayed on securely even in high wind.The wiper itself is a huge improvement over the other wipers that I have had , including Anco . What I love about this wiper is that it hugs the windshield , but it also moves easily across the glass when there is barely any water on the window , or if the window is covered.The windshield is left very clear and easy to see through with no streaks or spots left uncleared in heavy and light rain . I have not had any snow to evaluate winter performance yet . I will update when I do.What I love most about these wipers is that they are SILENT . No more squeaky wipers ! Everyone that has come in my car has remarked- `` Those wipers are completely SILENT ! WHERE DID YOU GET THEM ? `` I have to say they are the first wipers I have ever had which truly are silent so far after a few weeks of using them . So far they are my favorite wiper !	1
I 've been using Bosch wipers for many years , and have been especially pleased with their ICON blade . It clears the windshield very well with no streaks , and does so with far less noise than any of the OEM blades I 've had on my cars.While this new blade ( Clear Advantage ) is also excellent when it comes to clearing the windshield without any streaking , and it was very easy to install on my Infiniti EX . However , it makes more noise than the ICON . Rather than a hushed `` wisp-wisp '' sound , I get a small amount of chatter at the peak of the stroke . Not enough to be irritating , but certainly more than the ICON.I 'll continue to use these , but will be replacing them with some ICONs when their useful life is over or if the chattering gets louder . While the ICONs are a bit more expensive , I think they are a better blade .	1
Very good quality blades . Perfect for my 2003 Toyota corolla . Works as described ... there 's nothing better . Recommended to anyone that will love to try it	1
I replaced the worn out Bosch Icon Wiper Blades on my 2003 Dodge Ram 1500 with a new set of Bosch Clear Advantage Blades . The first thing that noticed is how similar they are to my last set of Icon blades . The Clear Advantage blades are almost identical to the Icon blades . The only major difference is that the Icon blades have a cover that closes and covers the top part where they hook on to the arm . The Clear Advantage blades do n't have the same cover and it 's open so snow and ice can get in it and freeze . When I compare how well both blades work I ca n't tell any difference at all . The Clear Advantage blades work well in the rain but struggle when it comes to snow , sleet and ice . I had the same results with my last blades . These wiper blades are just fine during Spring , Summer and Fall but I would n't recommend them for winter . They like to streak and not provide a very clean window surface for viewing when it comes to sleet or icy conditions . Overall I like these blades because they work well most of the year and they are very priced reasonable . I do n't really see any real advantage to getting the Icon Blades over the Clear Advantage blades so if trying to pick between the two I would go with these .	1
Wipes clean and true ; no squeak , chatter , or smear . The curve on the blade is strong , much better than the old style multi-hinged metal blade holder that came on the vehicle . The pressure is applied evenly across the entire blade as it form fits the shape of the windshield . With this blade you can update your vehicle with the latest blade technology that you see on the new cars . Bosch claims most wiper blades should be changed every 6 months but these will last a year . I have never changed mine more often than 1 year intervals , maybe these will last longer ? Installation was super easy , no adapter to change out , just remove the old wiper by pressing one clip and then installing this blade .	1
Easy installation and good wiping . No complaints thus far . Will update in a few months to report on how it held up .	1
These are great wipers . Easy to install and provides a clear windshield during bad weather.To me , it 's just easier to replace the whole wiper than just to replace the blades . I do n't have to worry about them coming back off.These are good quality and I 'm pleased with them .	1
I use these on the driver side of a 99 Pathfinder . They were easy to install and work great . We had a lot of rain and these wipers never gave me any trouble . I was able to drive safely in the rain without my visibility being compromised . It also helped clear the light snow I had just fine . I highly recommend these for your vehicle .	1
I love Bosch wiper blades . The installation is always quick and simple , and the quality of the blade is incredible . These blades do a great job of wiping the windshield without leaving streaks . They 're not too noisy either.I 've been using Bosch blades on my pickup truck for a couple years now . Replacing the blades on my wife 's car with Bosch blades was a no-brainer for me .	1
I really like to wait a full season before I review these , but for a month they have been perfect . Good price to .	1
These wipers work great but I should have gotten one 21 instead of 20 for the driver side of the 1999 Durango thus allowing more access to area coverage on the windshield .	1
The driver 's side windshield wiper on our family vehicle was starting to tear apart at the edges so I was happy to try these sample Bosch Clear Advantage Beam Blades . Last week there were brief but heavy rain showers that allowed me to test new and old style blades side by side.Advantages I 've noticed over old style wipers : > Less moving parts than old style metal framed blades. > Spring mechanism is the flexible beam itself rather than old exposed metal springs. > Lower profile for a less obtrusive , more modern appearance , also less likely to get damaged. > Uniform contact points conforms to highly curved windshields for more even wiping/cleaning. > Lighter and appears more durable . Old metal wiper frames tend to fade over time and the rubber blades tear away from the wiper assemblies. > Beam frame designed to create down force on wipers at highway speeds ; stable , effortless clearing of windshield. > Lower noise and streaking so far.Overall : A design advancement if wiper design that provides superior performance , safety , and durability over old wiper designs . Costs about double that of old design wiper blades . Good deal if these new Beam Blades last twice as long as old blades .	1
I installed this on the passenger side of my truck luckily 1 day before a week of torrential and much needed storms . I ca n't give 5 stars because I do n't feel there was any markedly significant improvement over my 2 year old wiper on the driver side.What I can say , is that this wiper is cleaner-appearing in that the `` wiper body '' is simple ; it does n't have the exoskeleton frame around it that your typical windshield wiper does . It seems to rely on some curvature to keep it flat on your windshield . Only time will tell if this curvature is maintained or if the `` exoskeleton frame '' on typical wipers is there for a reason and we should n't fix what is broken.Now , one improvement I have noticed that this wiper does NOT have and that 's the inclusion of an aero-foil so that at highway speeds , the wiper actually stays on the windshield glass . I have that on my weekend car and I have noticed a markedly signficiant improvement , the aero-foil really does keep the wiper on the windshield glass.I suppose if Bosch can keep the simple , cleaner-appearing non-wiper body plus adding a sleek aero foil , then at that time , it might be a 5-star wiper . For now , this model is 4 stars .	1
I use Michelin wiper for the driver side and Bosh for the passenger . After 2 months of heavy use this one doing well ( almost no stripes ) . After a cold winter with lots of ice on a windshield every day I 'd expect the rubber blade to deform and it did a little bit on Bosch . Good product for the money .	1
Windshield wipers need to work well when you need them . These wiper blades fit that bill . At least so far . They clean the windshield very well , in a variety of conditions . And they look like they are built well , so they will last.Too bad I ca n't tell you now how well these wiper blades work in a year or two . According to the experts , pretty much all wiper blades -- cheap or expensive -- clean windshields well for that long , but no longer.Given that , these wiper blades seem reasonably priced -- not the cheapest you 'll find , but not too expensive either . The 24-inch blade we needed for the other side of our windshield cost a little more , about $ 15 , so the set was about $ 30 in total . Shopping around , that 's not bad .	1
These are GREAT windshield wipers . After trying it out I bought them for all my cars . Easy to install and work great . My only complaint about Bosch is that they have a confusing product line and it 's not clear which wipers to use .	1
Bosch Clear advantage Beam wiper Blade is an excellent product It excells in heavy wind and rain . I love it ! Also it is not noisey like my old blades.They are very easy to install . And No annoying squeeks . I wish I had gotten them sooner ! !	1
I 've put these to use recently in rainy Florida weather and they get the thumbs up from me . My windshield cleared without streaking , and they seem like they will hold up for a long time . These are very well made , and worth the small extra cost because I believe these are more durable and long lasting than the cheaper options .	1
Bought this as a replacement for the drivers side of a 2013 Hyundai Sonata . The wipers work great and much better than the OEM ones ( which were thinner , did not last a year , and the plastic piece on top broke off ) . Installation was a breeze once I figured out how to unlatch it . Could n't be happier . Oh and they are much sportier looking for sure : )	1
Bosch Clear Advantage Wiper Blade 20 '' These are your typical graphite-coated rubber blades with an aerodynamic body . I 've used Pylon , Michelin , and Anco aerodynamic wiper blades in the past and generally speaking , they all worked flawlessly for the first year . Then , the spring pressure gets weak and they begin to either chatter or streak . I 've found from experience that replacing blades every 1-2 years is a good idea to prevent problems in the winter when the blade rubber tends to get stiff.These Bosch blades work great so far , but wiper blades generally do n't show problems until later in their life . The installation was simple , as they just clipped into the arms on the car.Overall : 5/5 stars , works great so far - no noise or streaking . But I will need to do longer-term testing to see if they last more than 1-2 years . Most of the aerodynamic wiper blades work fine for the first year and then show the typical chatter/streak issues common even with the less expensive blades .	1
Works great and I discovered these to be a better replacement than the upscale BOSCH wipers . You can save about $ 10 on each by sticking to these .	1
Amazon had these on a special deal , 2 for $ 20 . I bought a pair and after receiving them I ordered two more pairs . These wipe the windshield like a high dollar squeegee . I just hope they can withstand the Florida sun for a whole season.UPDATE : November 13 , 2013 : After an entire summer in the Florida sun I replaced these wipers with the same type I 'd stocked up when they were on sale . I think they performed well . The Florida sun in Summer and early Fall is brutal . Ultraviolet degradation is not uncommon . The high quality of these wipers was apparent in the fact that they lasted all season plus a few more months . New pair now installed , hopefully they 'll make it through until Springtime 2014 .	1
These are great wipers and go on in a snap ! Very good workmanship and great in the rain ! Love the spineless design !	1
When I bought my new wipers , I wanted the best of the best , so I chose these , which had the best reviews on Amazon . They 're good - but they 're not the incredible wiper I was looking for . I had Neoforms on my old car , and those were fantastic - they never left a single streak . The Bosch , on my new car , do n't fare quite as well , but they do a pretty good job.I 'm probably going to try out another set of Neoforms on this car later , so that I can make a true apples-to-apples comparison , and I 'll update my review once I do . For now , these are good enough , but if you 're looking for the 'ultimate ' wiper , you 'll probably want to keep looking .	1
I already had a similar style windshield wiper by another brand . One of the blades became slightly warped over time and would leave a small section untouched when it was on . We therefore decided to replace it with one of the Bosch blades before the rain season begins.This Bosch one seems to be slightly lighter than the other blade . I put it on the drivers side of my Mazda Miata . It was very easy to attach , no fancy hinged locking parts to navigate and press down . They just slide on and snap right into place.I park on the street and often get dust and pollen on the windshield in the morning and , as autumn creeps closer , the window fogs up on the outside in the morning . This makes visibility poor in the bright early morning sunlight if the windshield is n't swept thoroughly . This blade did a great job with the morning windshield and I feel much safer taking off for work in the morning . It clears all the dust and pollen no problem too , leaving the windscreen free of water and easy to see through . That 's important as I live in a part of town filled with trees and , in my experience , rain was actually easier for windshield wipers to deal with than dirt and pollen.So I like these blades . They do their job well and I 'm optimistic they will work well throughout the winter . And the price seems quite reasonable . I recommend them .	1
I have been using a jointless wiper blade ever since it became a popular replacement for the factory jointed type that is usually pre-installed when you buy a new vehicle . The Bosch 19-CA Clear Advantage Beam Wiper Blade fits the bills when you need to replace or just want to upgrade to a better performing wiper blade . There was no rain yet in my little corner of the country when I got this wiper so to be able to give a comprehensive review , I have to `` simulate '' rain-like conditions by turning a hose with a shower nozzle on the windshield in the driveway of my garage . Snow on the other hand is a different story , no way for me to simulate that kind of weather event.My thoughts : Performance : the jointless type Bosch 19-CA Clear Advantage Beam Wiper Blade is contoured better to `` hug '' your windshield with minimal resistance and pressure points . This translates to better wiping ability thereby enabling you to see better in inclement weather . Since it is jointless , this type of wiper gives you uniform wiping pressure , eliminating the pressure points or the `` streaks '' that you see across your windshield as it moves across the windshield . The curvature of this wiper is aerodynamic , it will prevent a lift-off of the blade even in high winds.Installation : it took less than 10 minutes to install the Bosch 19-CA Clear Advantage Beam Wiper Blade without using any of the adapters for my wiper arm.Very satisfied with how the Bosch 19-CA Clear Advantage Beam Wiper Blade has performed . It is cheaper compared to other jointless name-brand wiper but gives the same amount of effect . Highly recommended !	1
We liked these enough we already bought more for the other car . They are easy to install , are rubber , which I find last longer . The whole blade is springy and coated , all other wipers i have owned are exposed metal . So far so good , we had some rain and they do a great job , quiet and streak free . will update when it snows.update 4/13 These did well all winter and still look ok and intact , working good after 6 months .	1
I like the design of this wiper blade . I have had them installed on my 2005 Hyundai Elantra for a few months now and I really like how the bracketless design does not leave streaks . The only downside is that these get dirtier faster and need to be cleaned a little more frequently than traditional wiper blades but nonetheless they work really well .	1
Okay , first I must confess ... I 'm not a car crazy type of person . I view driving as more or less a necessary evil and tend to think of transportation as a function rather than extension of my personality ... much to the distress of my dear spouse.So , it should come as no surprise that car maintenance is also not at the top of my list . I try to take care of oil changes etc but other than that ... give little though to something until it becomes a problem . Therefore , the fact that I `` just '' changed the wiper blades on my vehicle just over 2 years ago ( well , according to my Amazon purchase records..make that 2 years and 8 months ) it was rather surprising to realize how much better these Bosch beam wiper blades were than my last pair ! In fact , when I purchased the last pair of wiper blades it was due to good ratings . Piaa Corporation Usa 94048 Wiper Blade Refill 19 ( 475mm ) . These fit my vehicle and were well rated but I specifically remember thinking they were n't that fantastic as there has always been this one little area that tends to streak during heavy rainfall . Living in Florida where nearly every afternoon in summer brings torrential rain , this is no small consideration.When these Bosch blades came up for review , I quickly looked up my vehicle type using Amazons part finder ( a GREAT Idea by the way ... thanks Amazon ! ) and figured out which version was needed for my vehicle . When they arrived , my dearest installed them and viola ... clear vision ! Installation took only a few minutes and was hassle-free.Very pleased . I 'm not sure how often wiper blades should be changed but apparently , more often than I 've been doing it . These are a substantial improvement over the Piaa brand blades right out of the box ... no major streaks .	1
Been buying different brands over the past 20 years and these are now my favorites ( sorry Triple Edge ) . Hug the glass nicely , substantial mounting bracket fits easily , no skips or chatter so far . Will be buying these annually I think . Very nice !	1
I am really impressed with the Bosch Clear Advantage wipers . The Bosch wipers are of such solid construction and quality I have now put them on both of my vehicles though the other was not yet due for new wiper blades - good thing they 're a good value , too ! True they are slightly more costly upfront than several competing brands ; when it comes to safety aspects and peace of mind we err on the side of caution . Afterall , our loved ones lives are at stake.The 21 '' wiper fit our '06 Dodge Durango ( front - passenger side ) perfectly and is a great replacement . It was very easy to install the entire arm assembly instead of the old days of fighting to change just the rubber `` blade '' . I easily had both front wiper blades replaced within 5 minutes . Awesome ! Bosch is a name that can be trusted , I highly recommend these wipers . If you have an '06 Durango , the driver 's side front wiper is theBosch 26-CA Clear Advantage Beam Wiper Blade - 26 '' .Note : these wipers are sold individually and some vehicles need 2 different sizes for the front . Additionally SUVs often require a different size for the rear wiper . Be sure to use Amazon 's nifty `` Find Part '' tool to verify these wipers will fit your vehicle . If you include your vehicle in the `` My Garage '' feature of Amazon it makes finding replacement parts a breeze to confidently order replacement parts and know they will fit your vehicle ( s ) .	1
I live in Central Florida and it rains hard almost everyday during our so-called Hurricane Seasons with severe pop up Thunderstorms and many times hail . I have been buying these Bosch Wipers from both my BMW and my Isuzu SUV . The rubber does seperate after about a year but the replacement is easy and fairly cheap . A word of warning : These wipers are NOT sold in pairs . You must state 2 in quantity . I made that mistake thinking that ; & # 34 ; Who the hell would sell you a single wiper blade ? Amazon , that 's who.. so I had to order another one . Both left and right are the same I presume . So other than the buying problem , rest assured these Wipers are & # 34 ; tops & # 34 ; in the Market .	1
The Bosch wiper blades work very well and make good contact with the glass along the whole length of the blade . Unfortunately , they just do n't look very nice . The blade part itself is kind of big and fat and the connector is even larger . Although I 'd have to admit that overall the Bosch wipers probably have less of a profile than the older metal wipers my car had , these just *look* big and fat and even clumsy in comparison . At least they work well .	1
I 'm a trained storm spotter and I drive a honda ridgeline truck and I 've used Bosch blades for a long time now and even in the harshest rain . I 've ALWAYS been impressed with the performance of Bosch blades . The blades do a great job at keeping the window clean , they move large amounts of water and seem to hold up really well . One thing I love about these blades is that the design is such that the more wind that hits these the harder they push down on your windshield which means they are more effective . I 'll continue to use Bosch blades on my truck and my wifes car .	1
I replaced the blades on my 2007 Toyota Corolla with this blade and theBosch 24-CA Clear Advantage Beam Wiper Blade - 24 '' . The blades they replaced were a pair of OEM blades that I picked up from the dealership during routine maintenance late last year . The OEM blades were worn , performing poorly and leaving streaks behind , so it was definitely time for replacement . The Bosch CA blades easily snapped right onto the vehicle in seconds . The CA blades are thicker and much more solid looking than the OEM blades they replaced . Although they work fantastic in the rain , the real test is how well they will perform in extreme conditions ( snow , ice , high winds , etc ) and how long they last . I replaced three wiper blades ( front and rear ) on my 2006 Sienna with Bosch Evolution blades this past March . All three are still working perfectly and I have been happy with them so far . I installed the Evolution blades just before spring , so although they did great with the spring and summer rain storms , I have n't yet had a chance to test them with snow and ice yet . So this winter will be a test for both Bosch models . As long as they both handle the snow and ice reasonably well , the best performer will be the replacement blade of choice for both of my vehicles next year .	1
It seems to be somewhat difficult to find a high quality wiper in this size . 13 & # 34 ; . While I ca n't claim to be an expert on all things windshield wiper , I can say from personal experience that this & # 34 ; style & # 34 ; of blade seems to last longer , and remove water much better than those crappy multiple arm versions . On the other types of blades , such as the cheapos sold by Rain-X , you have those little arms that lead from the metal part , down to the rubber . They hold it and apply pressure to it . I do n't know why but that style of blade just seems to pale in comparison to this one . There are several companies that make this type , Bosch being one of them . Michelin being another . All I know is , I 've switched to this type of blade and I 'm not looking back .	1
This wiper was easy to install . The directions really are n't of any help , but more or less I was able to just slide off the old one and slide on the new one ( you may have to fiddle a bit with the catches - which may not be obvious ) .Without any inclement weather I ca n't give a first hand account of it 's performance . The design is interesting as the frame is significantly wider than a stock wiper . I 'm curious to see how this will work in snow . It may just collect more snow and work worse , or perhaps the design will better remove accumulated snow .	1
Until I bought the Rain-X wipers I did n't believe there was actually such a thing as streak free wiper blades . And I like the metal free exterior frame design as well because it meant I no longer had to literally be chopping away at ice encased wiper blades in the wintertime . But I did wonder why no one else made a similarly well functioning product.When I got my hands on a pair of Bosch Clear Advantage blades to try in place of my Rain-X Latitude wipers I was a bit unimpressed because except for the brand logo they appear to me to be the same in every respect . They 're even priced about the same.So I love them , they 're the 'other best ' wiper blades I 've ever used , but they could have taken at least one little step to differentiate the product . May I suggest for example different colors . My car is silver ; I might like a pair of silver wiper blades , or some other color . I pick out different colors for parts on my high end bicycles which cost $ 5,000 a piece , so why would n't I be interested in doing something like that with my car.Just a suggestion .	1
I bought this 18CA wiper for my Frontier and it was real easy to install them . It took more time to take out my old Goodyear wipers that lasted me about 6months . These Bosch wipers run very smooth and no streaks . We will see how long they last me .	1
The installation is easy and the fit clips in securely . The blade 's arch form maintains contact with the glass surface for consistently clear wipes . I am quite pleased with the results.The Clear Advantage blades have a nice clean look . The cost is reasonable for excellent performance .	1
I purchase nothing but Bosch blades . Yes , they are more expensive . However , they last longer and clean better than others I have tried .	1
There 's not much more I can ask from a wiper blade than this : good price , easy installation , and no streaking when I use my wipers ! My old wiper blades clearly needed to be replaced as they just streaked water across my windshield , while these new Bosch ones just wipe my windshield clean , like they 're supposed to . Not much more needs to be said - they work great and if they ever need to be replaced , I probably would get these again . Very happy with them .	1
This has to be one of the easiest do-it-yourself car maintenance projects . It took about 30 seconds to snap off the old wiper & clip on the new one . The hardest part was figuring out how to take off the old wipers.The installation instructions are pictorial ; no words . There are no buttons to snap ; just slide the metal `` J '' shape clip over the wiper mechanism.The wipers work well ; no streaks & no blowing around at highway speed .	1
The Bosch 16 '' Clear Advantage wiper blade fit the passenger side of my 2007 Hyundai Accent perfectly . It was simple and quick to install . The blades mount well to the car and feel sturdy.I first tried these in a light mist with my windshield caked with salt from being parked for several hours at the beach . I was amazed at how quickly they cleared the residue and left no streaks . It literally took three strokes across the windshield to get them clear . My old wipers would have taken a couple minutes.I then went out driving in a typical Florida downpour . I tried the blades with all the available settings in my car ; intermittent , low and high speed . They were almost completely silent other than a slight , nearly inaudible , 'squig ' noise when the blades were fully 'up ' and the rain was light . In moderate , heavy and torrential rain they were whisper quiet.The blades cleared my windshield very well . Even in the worst downpour I could easily see the road . At one point the rain was heavy enough that several other drivers pulled to the side of the road to wait for the rain to let up . I was able to continue driving with confidence.Highly recommended ! I will update this review as needed if any durability issues arise over time .	1
This is a good wiper but there are others just as good that look better and last as long . Look at the Trico Teflon .	1
Compelled to write a Bosch Clr Adv review after a lengthy road trip , close to 1K miles in 3 days.It seems about two-thirds of the trip was in a Florida summer downpour , with highly limited visibility.The Bosch wipers worked great . I 'd buy them again in a flash , especially at the under- $ 12 price.Installation was a snap , so easy that I thought I must have done it wrong.DYI , these are replacements for Rain-X wipers ( never again for Rain-X , purchased four wipers for two vehicles ; all had cracking runner within months ) .	1
I opened my package and thought , `` Do I have enough time to install this before leaving ? '' I figured it was worth a try . In less than 5 seconds , it was on . It was so easy to slip off my old one and slip the hook on.The wiper seems to work well . It clears the entire area whether there is a drizzle or downpour . I have n't seen any streaking or gap areas yet.So a good price for a great wiper .	1
Before you buy wipers make sure that you 've got ones that are compatible with your year , make , and model . Amazon has a really nice `` Find Parts that Fit Your Vehicle '' feature that should make it easy for you to see whether a specific size and type of wiper ( the connector primarily ) can go on your car.This specific wiper is a driver 's side replacement on my 2003 Toyota . I have been usingBosch ICON Wiper Bladeswhich are easily the best wipers I 've ever used . They hug tightly , move smoothly , and are virtually streakless on the window . So far , this Bosch 21-CA Clear Advantage model is performing the same as the more expensive ICON version . We 've had about a dozen `` rain incidents '' since these have been installed ( and they installed easily ) and I have no complaints.An easy 5 stars for a product that does what it says and does it well . A HUGE step up ( for me ) from the $ 2 discount blades I usually get .	1
What I liked was that it was easy to get into the package . The product itself was very straightforward , easy to install . Took me two minutes.The set I 'm replacing had a metal body frame . This one is plastic , so I 'm worried that it might not hold up . It does seem well-made , and my vehicle is garage-kept , so hopefully this wo n't be an issue . Time will tell.My visibility has definitely improved from my old set .	1
Wiper blade for car . Great product . Definitely as described . Highly recommend . Needed new blades and these are the ones that I picked .	1
I like the Bosch Clear Advantage arrangement as a quick and easy replacement for original wipers . This configuration features a curved back with the rubber directly attached . It works great in rain . This new line is less expensive and geared for areas with rain . It is also an advantage to someone who is not planning to keep their vehicle a long time.For snow and ice where more rigidity and strength is required , I would definitely spend the extra money for the heavy duty , long lasting Bosch ICON line .	1
I drive a small size SUV and got this to use on my windshield . This was my very first attempt to install a replacement blade and I found it rather easy to do.One of the challenges I face at work is dirt from salt and sand from the ocean . The wipers have done a great job so far in cleaning the mess without leaving a streak.We 've had quite a bit of rain this month and the wiper covers the entire area without any skips , streaks or squeaking .	1
This is a great wiper . I had a rain-x wiper and it was okay . This one is quiet ( does n't squeak ) and clears water very well . Highly recommended . I wo n't buy any other wipers for our cars . Bosch is the way to go ! Worth the little extra in cost	1
Bosch 13-CA Clear Advantage Beam Wiper Blade - 13 '' is a nice rear wipe and easy to install . For $ 10.00 plus tax , the blade is priced fairly . Time will tell how long it lasts . These kind of blades usually last 6 to 12 months depending on usage . Overall , an effective blade .	1
Great fit	1
These work amazing but we had some snow pileup this winter and one of the wipers somehow got damaged . Now anytime I raise it up the thing just comes right off . I looked at this and it appears that one of the plastic pieces that attaches to the cars wiper arm just broke off . Not sure if this is a fault of the wiper or the snow , but it 's never happened to me before . Other than that , these things are perfect .	1
What a great wiper blade ! Absolutely flawless at leaving a perfectly dry windshield , even through light mist or drizzle.I love the curved design . This worked fantastic for the rear wiper arm of my Jeep , on which the spring has weakened and the wiper arm no longer presses normal wipers against the windshield hard enough to work well . This curved design hugs the back window perfectly and makes it streak-free every time.I have only had these a month or so , so I can not attest to longevity , but my first impression is very , very good !	1
This thing was the correct size and very easy to install . It cleans the water off of my windshield . Whee !	1
I used to only buy RainX brands and found these through Amazon with great prior reviews - so I took a chance . These are actually quite nice . They are quiet and seem to hold tighter to my windshield the previous blades .	1
I finally got to use my new wiper blades today - this and a 21 '' er - with the first rains from Hurricane Sandy coming through . They work perfect ! Test 1 complete . The harder test is how long they last , but I have no doubts they will perform better than whatever I bought last time at the local auto parts store . I could tell out of the packaging that they were exceptional : the entire frame is a spring that had the blade more curved than any I 've seen out of the box . It then straightened out perfectly on my windshield.Check your car 's manual carefully . I am by no means an idiot when it comes to such things , but I had a pair of 20 '' ers on before ( ca n't remember if that was actually my doing ) that did not cover as much surface area as this correctly sized pair.This simple replacement ( very easy to install ) feels like a big upgrade to my car for the day .	1
Windshield wipers have become easier to install . This installed easily on the driver 's side of Chevy Avalanche 2004 and is working like a dream . The parts finder says this does not fit this truck but it works great . No streaks or squeaks ... Have yet to experience a heavy rain with this but so far works great !	1
Best wiper I 've ever had . Streak free and noiseless . Much better than the junk at Walmart . You can always count on Bosch .	1
These windshield wipers are great in rain and snow . They do n't skip when the wind is blowing and it is raining like most traditional windshield wipers do . Also I like how quiet they are , they only things you hear is the rain hitting the window . I would definitely recommend these to anyone .	1
I got this for the driver side of our 4-door Honda Accord ( 2001 ) . This is a cheaper version of their Icon wiper line . One of the differences is that it does n't have that little plastic hood that cover the metal hook . Like the Icon , it is also very light and made mostly with composite materials instead of metal parts.The soft frame curves and conforms to the shape of the surface glass as opposed to conventional wipers that has two parts - the metal frame and the moving part that is the rubber . No streak and it looks great on my car.Replacing wipers is pretty easy . You may need to look at the instruction as different manufacturers have different ways of releasing them from the hook , but basically takes only thirty seconds to remove the old and snap a new one.CAUTION : Be careful when you leave the wiper standing on your windshield after you remove the old one . The wiper is spring loaded , without the wiper it is pure metal and it may snap back to your windshield glass . You may want to place a cardboard box or a towel on top of your glass to protect it while replacing your wipers .	1
Both of my vehicles have Bosch wiper blades on them and I like how they perform . They are easy to put on and work well at clearing the water off . No streaking or rubbing .	1
I tried other brands , all started working well at the beginning but perform poor few weeks/months later . This one works the best and better than all the rest .	1
I 'm known for my short , no-nonsense but informative reviews , so here goes : - much more in-line with the now-standard soft , less rigid squeegee form factor for on blades of most modern cars today.- head and shoulders above the kind you are likely to get as a POS ( point of sale ) item at your local gas station or car wash.- quite reasonably priced considering the quality .	1
I got these to replace the OEM blades on our 2010 Mercedes GLK , which started to squeak only a couple of months after being replaced by dealer . The GLK needs one 19 & # 34 ; and this 22 & # 34 ; one . So far these replacements work very well - they were easy to install , the contact with the glass is good ( there are no & # 34 ; dead sports & # 34 ; at the ends of these wipers ) and so far they have n't produced any unpleasant sounds after few months of work .	1
These are much better windshield wipers than my michelins . They last longer and work better . There 's not much else to say !	1
While i shopping for car filters for my 2008 honda accord I saw this blade and its companion for the passenger side - I like them alot and it saves me as i drive 200-250 miles a week - will buy again	1
I 've been a convert to the streamlined no steel frame wiper blades since I received them on a 2007 Altima . They look good , they cover the windshield thoroughly and they do n't chatter or make clicking noises when the blades reverse direction . In the past , I 've been spending a lot of money on Valeo brand as I thought they were the best . But they 're pricey.Installation is a cinch , squeeze the center expander , push down into arm , and snap -- it 's done . Very quick & simple.This brand is the perfect summer blade -- it 's a bit less bulky and more streamlined . Being that I replace the blades before and after each winter , this is a smaller more appealing looking blade for the summer , and saves me some money during my summer swap out.I may still stay with the Valeo for the winter swap , but I 'm going to leave this on through the winter to see how well they hold up . The rubber edge is clear so I 'm thinking they may contribute less to blackening of the windshield.I 'm using this as the passenger blade on a 2012 Altima SR .	1
I bought this as a direct replacement for the OEM blade on a 2000 Toyota Land Cruiser . Very simple install ; just click off the old wiper , click the new one in its place . Does a fantastic job on the windshield , leaves very few drops behind .	1
I replaced the factory installed wiper blades that came with my Hyundai with two Bosch wiper blades . This wiper blade fit the front passenger side . I also installed a 24 inch Bosch blade on the driver side of my car . I have used these blades for a couple of weeks and they work fine and were easy to install.My Hyundai is three years old so it was time to change the wiper blades . I have done this before on a Honda so I had some experience . It took me less than five minutes to remove both existing wiper blades and install the Bosch blades.I have driven at night in the rain after I installed these and they worked fine . Next to driving in the snow , I find the performance of a wiper blade while driving in the rain at the night to be most critical . Vision is limited while driving at night in the rain and it is important to me that my wiper blades get as much water off my windshield as possible . I am very comfortable driving at night with these . They did a good job.Thankfully it has yet to snow but I will try to remember to write how they worked in the snow and ice . As of now these are great wiper blades at a great price .	1
I installed these on my '09 F150 . It hugs the window well and provides quiet , streak-free operation . Well worth the price .	1
I 've never used Bosch wiper blades before trying the Clear Advantage models . I 've always stuck with the standard Trico wiper blades . The problem with regular wiper blades is the pressure points cause uneven wear over time which leads to streaking and reduced visibility . The 19-CA Bosch Clear Advantage Beam wiper blades promise to reduce the likelihood of that problem , by using a flat spring-steel bar to apply a more even pressure across the surface of the blade . On my particular windshield , the blades seem to live up to this claim during heavy rain at both high and low vehicle speeds . In fact , I 'm almost certain they actually wipe better at faster speeds due to the air-foil design helping to push the blade against the windshield surface . My car uses two different size blades , 19 '' and 24 '' , and I can tell that the 19 '' is better at giving a cleaner wipe than the longer 24 '' model , which seems to have a little trouble towards the ends of the blades when clearing the windshield of mud and grime .	1
I am using these wiper blades ( 20 '' and 24 '' ) on my Kia Borrego SUV . It has a large windshield , and I have had problems with wiper blades in the past . However , these Bosch Clear Advantage wiper blades are working great . They handle heavy rain and a light drizzle equally well . There is no smearing or skipping , and they are quiet.My better half installed these for me , and he commented that it was an easy job . The real test of these wiper blades will come this winter , when they need to handle snow and sleet . However , I am impressed with their performance so far .	1
I ordered this wiper for this for my rear window wiper . The installation could not have been easier . It did n't even require reading the instructions ( although I would recommend it ) .We park under a tree for shade and birds like to leave little presents for us . The leaves also generate a lot of dust or dirt when it rains . This wiper had no problems whatsoever and it moved smoothly and quietly . I will replace all future wipers with these . Good one Bosch !	1
Does n't leave any streaks . Completely wipes the windshield.. Bosch has always made quality products . Try to oil and air filters .	1
These wiper blades are high quality and are more flexible than others and seem to hug the windshield for a clear wipe every time . They seem to be more durable than other types and look like they will last longer . Be sure to use the selection guide at the top of the product page with your car make and model so you get exactly the right size for your vehicle . They work great !	1
Compared to $ 25.00 to $ 40.00 retail at a autoparts place this is a good deal and they work just as good as the more expensive ones .	1
The bosch brand has seem to hold up better then any other brand I have used and lasted much longer .	1
Not much that can be said about a wiper blade . I live in the North East and drive my car about 150-200 miles daily ... and with the crazy weather we have , good blades are imperative . I have always purchased Bosch blades and spark plugs for my cars and they have yet to let me down.The price is at a bit of a premium..but its old adage ... you get what you pay for . I usually get a good 4-6 months , if not longer , out of these blades and highly recommend them.100 % perfect.5/5	1
When buying wiper blades , you tend to have one thing in mind for there purpose : to work and wipe rain and other moisture away . There are so many brands and styles out there . How can you decide what is great and whats not ? thats not an easy question to answer . Honestly i think it depends on each individual person experience . But for may in giving these blades a chance , they worked well . Added extra visability and cleared the windsheild as they should . Your experience may vary , but as long as the serve their purpose and work , than any set of blades are great .	1
These wiper blades are very quick and easy to install . They work really well in rainy conditions . They are n't the best that I 've had when it comes to icy/snowy conditions . They smear a bit more than I think they should.Overall they 're good blades for the majority of the year but if you are in an area that get quite a bit of snow and ice during the winter months I 'd maybe look for a different set of wiper blades .	1
These look very different from the standard windshield wipers that came installed on my car . Instead of a multi hinged contraption with a blade they are one long slightly curved piece.Removing the original wipers is the hardest part of installation . Mine had a little clip that had to be depressed before you could pull them off . If you can not figure out how to get them off , google your car model and year and `` windshield wiper replacement '' . After you get the originals off , you are left with just a `` hook '' on the mount for your car . These new Bosch blades fit over the hook and snap on . The instructions are just pictures , which drives me nuts , but in this case it was reasonably clear how to get them on.On my big flat minivan windshield these work very well . Had the opportunity to test them in a driving rainstorm . Noticeably better than the original wipers , without streaks or squeaking noises .	1
The Bosch 20-CA Clear Advantage Beam wiper blade is one of the best wiper blades I 've put on my car . I live in south Texas where we have alot of morning fog , and when it does rain it is inches in an hour . This blade gives me a clean clear windshield through it all . No streaks or missed spots . I actually did'nt even get that annoying thumping noise when I left the wipers on after the rain stopped . I would recommend this wiper to everyone .	1
Installed this on Friday and Monday on the way to work had rain . Works well , as well as the old style I had before . It does squeak a bit more than my old one but on the other-hand , it does wipe better .	1
This is a quality blade . It is quiet and does not leave streaks like my old ones ! First for 2001 Honda Civic LX driver 's side .	1
NOTE : The owner 's manual for my Toyota called for a 14 '' blade , but the 13 '' blade fit OK.These are some `` beefy '' wiper blades compared to what came on my 2010 Toyota . The hardest part of the installation was getting the tab pulled up on the wiper arm ( I have the hook-type installation ) since my blades had never been changed from when the car was built . Easy to install these once I got the old ones off . I was surprised at the curvature of these Bosch blades but the spring holds the wiper blades perfectly against the windshield . I guess the real test will be 2-3 months from now when we get the first big snow .	1
I bought a trailer to haul my Jeep . Because it 's so low , the license plate gets bent . Flipping onto the top works fine , but it 's no longer lit . This little light was the perfect answer to the problem .	1
I had a custom metal bumper made for my Chevy truck , and they put an incandescent license plate light on there ( two actually ) that just looked like crap with my LED bulbs in the taillight and backup lights . They were shaped just like these , so I was glad to find some that would be a direct replacement . I could n't use LED bulbs in the old light , because they were longer and not enough room to fit in the housing.So I got these installed finally the other day , and they are plenty bright and a nice white color to them . They match the color temp of the LED backup bulbs I have even . Simple little thing totally changed the look of the back of my truck at night . ( Now if I could only find some of the oval backup lights like they put in my customer bumper that are as bright and white as these . Even though they used LEDs , the color is awful and temp of the light is not nice ) The housing on these comes apart from lens part for install . The LEDs are angled to face the open part of the lens . If you are hesitant to get these worrying about brightness or color temp , do n't worry ! These are great !	1
Easy to replace the OEM light . At first , I was concerned that this LED was not as bright as the OEM . The light worked after I installed it , which at times is amazing , but did not seem as bright . At night , when the light is needed , there is no doubt . This is brighter . Overall I am very satisfied with this light and will replace the other couple of lights with this LED .	1
I purchased this light for a vented cat box project . This light and a 120mm computer fan are powered off a 12v wall wart . The result is the cats can see to do their business and the fumes are vented to the great outdoors .	1
Well made lights with decent output . I would n't necessarily describe the light as & # 34 ; warm white & # 34 ; . I thought it was slightly cooler looking . There is no real blue tint that stood out . Maybe calling it & # 34 ; daylight white & # 34 ; ? These are well sealed lights and should be very weather resistant . You can actually separate the bulb/lens from the mounting shell . The wires come out from the back center of the light .	1
This is a lot smaller then it looks in the picture , which is great . It is about the size of a USB thumb drive . It has 6 L.E.D , which produces a white light , not blue as pictured in the photo gallery . I used this on my motorcycle , facing forward as a tag light . Not only does it light up the tag but it lights up the entire rear of the bike switch is an added safety feature for night riding . So far I have not experienced any issues with rain , water , mud or dirt getting into it . The construction/ build quality is top notch . If I have any issues I will update this review .	1
using it as illumination for a trailer license plate . super bright . way brighter than the similar style incandescents that have always been the norm . im thinking about getting one or two for lighting around our 12v off grid cabin . they would be plenty bright to light up a set of 5 or so stairs .	1
I enjoy detailing my car . Although I used many tire shine products , I wanted to find one that had the right balance between shind and protection . Many of the tire shine products weaken the tire walls or interact with the rubber . Others have & # 34 ; fling & # 34 ; and unable to hold the shine . I found I needed to touch it up at least 1x per week . This product is easy to apply and has held the & # 34 ; black & # 34 ; well for the past several weeks . It is n't as shiny as other silicone based products but it also is safer for your tire . I wanted a product that will keep my tire a dark black for at least a month . This does it .	1
Most of the tire treatments I have used in the past , went on fast , and came off the tire even faster . I would find most of it all over the hub caps , and side of the car . Used the applicator as directed , went on easy , and stays put . So far , it has been three weeks since I did the application , and it still looks as good as when I first put it on ! ! ! !	1
The delivery was very fast from Amazon.The product is very to use . It is gel like . I used a microfiber applicator to dab it on the tires . I prefer a hi gloss shine . I put 2 applications on each tire . I did not notice a impressive result . I let it cure for about a half hour . It looked better . I parked the car in the garage overnight . I was extremely impressed the next day when I checked on the tires appearance . It was a deep classy look . The car had a different look . The car by the way is a 2012 MAalibu LTZ . If you detail your own car you 'll enjoy using this product . I recommend it highly .	1
The tire dressing market is saturated with so many products that it is ridiculous . I have tried them all and never really got excited about one product or another . This is very different though . Do not layer it on top of any other tire protectant . Make sure your wheels are squeaky clean before you apply this to get maximum adhesion . Use a round foam applicator to apply product . Make sure to wipe off any that looks even slightly excessive . Once this is done , you will see the best shine you have ever seen on your tires . I live in Sunny Dry California as well , so it probably stays nicer looking than in other states . I am using up the rest of my tire dressings and then will only use this product exclusively in a few months . I 'm sure there are better products out there . However , I ca n't even remember how many different ones I have tried . This beats the rest by far . A little goes a long way and the price is pretty good .	1
Seems like a good product . Used to use meguairs extreme tire shine gel and they seems to be the same .	1
Sanctiond tire glaze gel works really well on tires . It is a thick gel with a consistency ( kind of ) like maple syrup . This allows for the gel to be applied to tires and keeps the gel from running off tires onto rims or quarter panels while driving ( referred to as slinging ) . A small amount of product goes a long way ; more product = higher shine . You can achieve a subdued , fairly long lasting shine with one coat . For a high gloss tire , run a second coat and your tires will really gleam . I have applied about three times to each of the four tires on both an SUV and a coupe ( 24 tires total ) and still have about 3/4 of the bottle left . For what it is worth , my method to apply is by pouring a small amount into a bowl ( I use the top of an old spray paint can ) and then use a paint brush to `` paint '' the gel onto the tires . This allows me to conserve the product while ensuring that I get even , complete coverage on the tires . Hopefully that hint can work for you too . I recommend this tire glaze as it is of high quality and the pricing is reasonable . The only product I have ever used that came close was the old formulation of Stoner 's MoreShineLessTime , but that product has been reformulated and is no longer as effective . Good luck . I comparison shop a lot before buying anything - hopefully you can benefit from my time investment and review .	1
This stuff works great , gives a good shine but not overly glossy . It holds to the tire and does not seem to fly off onto the car when you drive . This was my first use and the only thing I am not sure about is , it soaks into the sponge applicator I used differently than the last stuff I used and I will have to see how that goes on future uses . But so far I think I would re- order when I am out.UPDATE ... using this for over two months now ... it is really a good product , will re-order from Amazon when I run out but it may be a while , this stuff really lasts.I am increasing my four star rating to five on that basis .	1
This stuff is really thick you can realistically get 20-30 details done with this stuff ( depending on tire profile ) . The sling off is very minimal but it 's still there . Still tons better that black magic . Smells good too .	1
This is an update to my original review ... I 've been using Sanctiond Tire Glaze for 6 months now and it ca n't be topped . It is incredibly easy to apply , smells great , and really lasts a long time , even after several car washes . Because you do n't need to use a lot to get a great looking finish it 's very economical . The glaze goes on smoothly and stays put , no splashing or slinging onto the car after it 's applied . This product is well worth every penny and I highly recommend it !	1
I am now a big fan of Sanctiond products . I used this for the first time yesterday . I followed the directions and the wheels and tires came clean . Very clean . I also used Sanctiond Tire Shine . I let it set into the tires overnight and in the morning I had some very impressive looking tires . Deep shine . Try it . You wo n't be sorry !	1
So far so good with Sanctiond W30016 Wheel and Tire Cleaner - 16 oz . Seems to work well at loosing brake dust and road debris from my wheels . Happy i made the purchase , would recommend you give it a chance as well	1
Best cleaner I have used so far . I recently changed brake pads and during break in alot of brake dust built up on wheels . I let it go too far and it became baked on . I ordered this product and was very happy with the results . I had to use it twice to get the dust off but the wheels look great now . I use this product every other wash and this seems to do the trick . I ordered another bottle to have on hand .	1
Ive used 3m , meguire 's , and every other major brand of tire and wheel cleaner and this is the best ive found . The tire shine is a little disappointing but the tire and wheel cleaner delivers . It does go fast though .	1
Sprayed it on my truck 's tires and let each tire soak for about a minute before using a scrub brush on them . The first go round removed almost all of the accumulated brake dust and tire shine gunk on the tires . A second treatment cleaned up the tires quite nicely and left a like new surface to apply new tire shine . The tire shine I used was Sanctiond 's `` Tire Glaze Gel '' . What a HUGE disappointment that was .	1
I ordered this unit to be able to power my various chargers , but most importantly my Li-ion 18v cordless drill/ impact driver charger which claims to consume 250 watts , which I found surprisingly high as I was looking at a 120 watt Samlex.I do have an older Coleman 800 watt MSW inverter but it has destroyed some other battery chargers in the past and I no longer take the chance of it releasing the magic blue smoke.I only got the unit yesterday , and I used it , through the ciggy plug adapter to recharge some 14500 Li-ion batteries and to power my 90 watt power brick for my laptop . My battery voltage was 12.1 at the time , and the alarm started sounding on the inverter off and on when powering the laptop and charging the dead Li-ion battery within.Anyway I plan on hardwiring this into my RV with a 50 amp fuse.What I like is that it is so quiet . My coleman inverter uses 0.9 amps just turned on powering nothing , and the small fan , which I have replaced once already , is annoyingly loud and runs full speed , always . This unit consumed only 0.3 amps turned on powering nothing , and I have not heard the fan turn on , even when my laptop was drawing 90 watts through it.I have not checked the actual voltage under load , nor maxed it out yet , nor have any idea how long it will continue to operate , but this unit does give me the capability to live completely off the grid , and to use my solar excess where as before I had to use the grid to power the chargers which might protest the modified square wave inverterIt comes in a hard to open blister pack , and this was kind of loose in the Amazon box and flopping around inside of it . It could have been packed better but seems to not have suffered any damage in shipping	1
This true sine-wave inverter offers a fantastic value and so far , in the last month I 've owned it , it has worked flawlessly in my rv . I am using it exclusively for right now to operate my Omega juicer and it runs the unit flawlessly keeping me in healthy juices every day ! It arrived days earlier than the stated expected delivery date , so you need not be concerned , at least from my experience , that the seller would offer anything but the best service to you .	1
When I saw how big this thing was I was skeptical . I mean , my 1,500 watt inverter that I bought back in 2004 is only a bit larger ! However , this unit performs well , does n't get hotter than I would expect , and can be left on for a long time without overheating . I have n't had it long enough to say if it will last , but for a first few weeks impression I am very pleased !	1
This Wagan power inverter is a great solution when those smaller power inverters for your car just ca n't supply enough power . A good example would be if you need to run a printer or a desktop PC in your car . Electronics really need clean power , and the Wagan provides a nice source of power that more accurately emulates the sinusoid of wall power . That being said , do you need a 400W supply ? The inverter comes with a cigarette lighter adapter and clips to put directly on a battery , but if you are going through the car 's cigarette lighter , note that you can only go to 150W . This is not a limitation of Wagan , but a limitation of your car . If you intend to use your cigarette lighter only , then buy a smaller inverter.The one downside is that I noticed the internal fan is a little noisy , especially under heavy load . From what I can tell however , this is a fine choice for occasional needs of higher power such as a printer , desktop PC , or small television so long as you connect it directly to the car power system and do n't use the lighter .	1
I like the feature set on Wagan 's EL2601 Inverter . Multiple 3-prong outlets are to be expected at this price point , but the USB charging outlet is a nice plus . It can handle a substantial load ( 400W , though if you 're running it from a cigarette lighter outlet it will cap it at 150 to protect your vehicle ) and is virtually silent at the smaller loads ( & lt ; 50 watts ) , and not loud even at full force.The box itself is pretty hardy , and comes with built-in mounting holes , though I wish the ones in the rear were a little closer to the edge so the terminals were n't in the way as much ; my power screwdriver could n't get to the screws and I had to go with a regular screwdriver.The inverter comes with two sets of cables - a DC plug for the cigarette lighter , and alligator clamps for direct connection to the battery . The clamps were my biggest issue with the inverter - namely , the fact that the rubber grips tend to slip off , which is more than a little worrisome . I also would have like to see a more permanent cable option , such as a terminal connector , for long-term connections . I 'm using my inverter in conjunction with a leftover power mower battery and a solar panel to provide light-load electric power in a shed , and had to get creative hooking things up as both the panel and the inverter only came with DC plugs and clamps.I have n't really tested the `` pure sine '' claim extensively , given my application , but the fluorescent lights I 'm using seem to flicker less with this inverter than others I 've used , so there 's that.The inverter will give a high-pitched beep when it loses power or is turned off , so keep that in mind if you 're attaching it on the downstream side of a switch.All in all though , a few gripes aside , this is a quality product that performs as advertised .	1
There are two points that struck me to mention first.~ 1 . The obvious ~ But in this case more critical then usual.Be sure to always attach the polarity connection correctly , red to red & black to black.General instruction : ( pg 3 ) 'Incorrect battery polarity will damage the inverter & void the warranty.Do not open the inverter , there are no user serviceable parts inside.This inverter has 'reverse polarity protection ' by means of an internal fuse , but the instructions state : ( pg 7 # 2 ) 'Reverse polarity connection will blow the fuse in the inverter & can permanently damage the inverter.Damage caused by reverse polarity will void the warranty'~ 2 . All WAGAN Corporation products must be registered within 30 days of purchase to activate the warranty.Replacement products will be in warranty for the balance of the original 2 year warranty.This is an nice inverter , with more available wattage then our family would commonly need on a road trip.But this is also handy to run our desktop computer ( approx 300 watts ) and a lamp ( approx 100 watts ) for a while during a power outage.It will provide a suggested 140 watts plugged in the cigarette lighter , ( Not to exceed 150 watts ) That amount will power a medium size LCD -T.V . ( approx 70 watts ) ~ OR a laptop computer ( approx 90 watts ) plus other items at the same time up to 140 watts.The inverter has a USB power port compatible with iPad & tablet , for charging mobile electronics , but this kit does n't include the USB cable that would be needed.For additional wattage over 140 up to the 400 watts this inverter will provide , it needs to be connected to the automobile/boat/RV battery ( neutral to ground bond for marine applications ) ~ 1 . Included are two cables ~ a 42 '' cigarette lighter/accessory adapter & 31 '' long battery cable clips.There is adequate holding of the ring connectors on the threaded terminals of 3 1/4 turns when onlyone set of cables at a time are connected.~ 2 . The inverter runs up to 90 % efficiency which supports longer running time & greater care of the battery.~ 3 . Inverter has Two AC outlets which provide up to 3.3 amps.~ 4 . One USB port which powers up to 5 volts at 2.1 Amps.~ 5 . Short circuit protection is by means of automatic shut down.~ 6 . Overload , overheat and low battery protection ~ automatic shut down.~ 7 . If shut down is preceded by a buzzing sound it 's possible there 's excessive load or a low battery or cable problem.~ 8 . All inverters will automatically shut off when the battery discharges to 9.5 volts.This lower remaining amount of battery voltage will still start the vehicle.~ 9 . For T.V . and audio equipment the inverter is shielded to minimize signal interference , but it may effect T.V . picture anyway.Wagan offers suggestions what to do , among others ~ move the T.V . away from the inverter by running an extension cordbetween the inverter and T.V.~ 10 . To help reduce the noise caused by power conversion when using radio frequency devices ~connect an insulated copper wire to the ground terminal ~ and the other end should be connectedto a proper grounding point.Some examples are listed . The harmonic distortion is 3 % which is rather high.A start-up load is approximately twice the continuous load which is why this inverter has a peak of 800 watts.Wagan suggests to determine if an item will operate with this inverter , do a test run . `` This inverter will automatically shut down in the event of an output overload , so there 's no danger of damagingeither the inverter or the equipment . '' A red LED light signals a fault.BUT ~ DO N'T exceed 800 watts which will blow a fuse.To do the math ~ multiply the amps listed on the item times 120 ( 120V AC ) to finds the wattsAll Wagan Tech inverters feature True-rated Power ( tm ) . Which means power is tested and rated at a periodof 24 hours continuous usage under full load.Wagan says the competition claims `` continuous '' , when in fact , they are often only 30 minutes `` continuous '' .Afterwords , the competition 's output wattage will drop down as much as 30 % of the claimed wattage	1
Up Front : I found the Wagan 2601 Elite 400 Watt PRO Pure Sine Wave Power Inverter well built and easy to install in my RV.Before installing the unit I put it on the bench with a steady input voltage of 12.9 volts DC . With no load on the unit I measured 124 volts AC . I attached a 300 watt TV and again measured the output voltage and it remained steady at 119 Volts . Adding a 100 watt light bulb to the load dropped the voltage to 115 volts . The unit was warm approaching very warm to the touch after a 400 watt constant load of 2 hours.The unit is not a silent inverter . It 's not loud , but you know it 's running . The noise is mostly from the fan I suspect . It comes with a cigarette lighter plug , as well as battery clamps . I ran # 12 wiring to the battery bank in the RV . In an auto using the cigarette lighter plug I suspect the output voltage will be dependent on the size wiring from the cigarette lighter outlet to the vehicles battery . For a full 400 watt output it might need a heavier wire connection then most 12 Volt DC outlets are supplied with.One item of note : When plugged into the autos cigarette lighter outlet and using a full 400 watt device that has a higher surge to start up , it may overload the vehicles cigarette outlet fuse and blow the fuse . I was not able to measure the amps the unit draws however so this is speculation.Installation is straight forward and the mounting brackets on the unit are strong and helpful .	1
I 've been testing the Wagan EL2601 Elite for a few weeks with my DIY solar power panel system and 12 volts sealed lead acid batteries . So far it performs great.During the last year , we endured more than a week of power outage after bad storms crossed our town , and we depended of a couple of inverters I own to supply the essential electricity for lights and recharging devices.The only downside was that both were modified wave power inverters and produced interference with some of our electronics . One of the storms happened in the middle of the summer , and when I tried to use an electric fan with the inverters the noise that the modified wave DC produced was unbearable . I ended using a couple of D cell batteries powered fans instead.A true sine wave inverter , like the Wagan EL2601 Elite provides a pure signal which will not interfere with the sensitive electronic gadgets at all . The Wagan EL2601 Elite has a very low harmonic distortion , THD & lt ; 3 % and the first thing I did was to try the electric fan with it , this time there is no perceivable noise at all.I also tested it with fluorescent lamps , USB lights , a laptop and charging my cell phone . I 'm so pleased that I 'll be getting a second one , and I recommend it for sure .	1
This is a useful device for anyone who takes road trips . I can charge my laptop as well as my iPhone or iPad at the same time via the built in USB charge port , while on a car trip via the accessory power jack in my car . If I 'm traveling with the kids , they can charge their Nintendo DS systems , etc . also.If you need to power something that takes more power such as a power drill or something like that , you need to plug this directly to your car battery to avoid blowing the accessory jack fuse in your car . It 's nice that this comes with both types of plugs . I would also recommend you do this with the car running so you do n't burn out your car battery , however this device does include an alarm that beeps when your car battery is getting low . It is supposed to warn you before the point where the car battery drains to a point of not being able to start the car , although I have not tried this yet.This unit is lighter and feels a bit less quality than I expected at this price and it remains to be seen how reliable it is over the long term . That said , it appears to be functioning well so far .	1
I purchased these to replace some lights I had mounted on my snow blower . I had put some lights on the snow blower of my tractor last winter to help me see when snow blowing the driveway in the dark . The lights on the tractor just did n't help much especially since the chute on the snow blower blocked most of the light . The lights I had put on originally were cheap and did n't put out much light . They failed after one season . I found these online through Amazon and thought I would give them a try . Boy has LED technology come a long way . They are very bright and I have no problems seeing what I am doing while clearing the driveway . They even cut through the blowing snow . Seam to be very durable . Time will only tell but for now I am extremely happy with my purchase .	1
I have 4 of these on my Polaris RZR and 2 of them on my enclosed cargo trailer and they are bright and are well worth the money . I will be ordering 4 more to go on my Jeep . Ca n't beat the price !	1
I bought 2 of these for my off road pickup . They are as bright or brighter than my HID headlights . I will most likely buy 2 more .	1
I bought these to compliment the Rigid Industries light bar I already have . I have the 10 & # 34 ; specter beam and wanted something with a bit more flood . I was planning on getting another Rigid light bar , but then I came across these . I could n't pass them up for the price . I figured if they did n't satisfy me I could put them on the back of the truck as reverse/work lights . I installed 4 of them in the lower grill of my Titan and wow , did they do the trick . They look great and they really light everything up . I know a lot of people use these types of lights as a cheaper alternative to Rigid 's , and I 'd say they are worthy.The build quality is good , not as precise and lacking some of the better materials Rigid uses , but for the price you ca n't complain , and I think these should stand up to most abuse.The color temperature of this light is about 5000k , while the Rigid appears to be closer to 6000k . But from inside the truck they both appear to be pure white.They do n't have the distance I get with the Rigid light , but that 's expected given the beam pattern is narrower on the Rigid and the optics are better . They are much wider than the Rigid though.These lights will please anyone planning to use them as their only off-road lights . You just ca n't beat the price .	1
Nothing to really complain about here . these light are durable and can easily take a banging . I go into much more detail in my video review . [ ... ]	1
Works like a charm on my Ariens snowblower alternator , but had to add a fuse , bridge rectifier and 4700uf capacitor to change the ac to filtered dc ( gives 11vdc at idle ) . Gives much more light than a filament lamp , and no more broken filaments , due to vibration ! Looks to be ruggedly built and should last for years . Hardware is stainless , except bracket , which is plated steel which may rust .	1
These lights are amazing . I have placed three orders because i keep finding places to mount these lights . I have come to find out that there is a huge difference in quality between suppliers . The first set of lights that I received were decent with no issues . The second I ordered ( different supplier ) had a few blown LEDs in two of the three lights right out of the box . The powder coating was & # 34 ; eh so so & # 34 ; . Amazon refunded it no questions asked . The third set ( again different supplier ) is truly better than the others that I have ordered . The wiring and powder coating are obviously the best so far . I 'm going to stick with this last seller as there is a night and day difference in quality . And for 20 something dollars a light how can you go wrong . The spot lights ( 30 degree spread ) are where it 's at . The floods ( 60 degree spread ) do n't throw the light very far but are super bright and are good for reverse lights . Yes there is a difference . Pay attention when ordering . YOU WILL LOVE THEM ! ! ! I have them wired to everything ! ! ! !	1
I was very impressed by the amount of light these throw . They are very solid and well made . I can not attest to how long they will last as I have only had them a couple weeks .	1
Used these on a quad for extra light and they are amazing , I ca n't believe how bright these are . I used the spot beam and they throw off an incredible amount of light ... I would buy these over the name brand Rigid for the price any day ... .	1
I 've tried a spotlight ( too focused ) and a floodlight ( too diffuse ) on my service trailer for working on stranded cars roadside - I thought that , for the price , I might try one of these and see if it would be more appropriate than either of the incandescent fixtures I 've tried already . While I would dispute the 30-degree claim , the most significant portion of the illumination is probably within a 30-degree arc - what is surprising is just how useful the additional spread is ; it 's sufficiently contained to be out of the line-of-sight of approaching vehicles , but spread enough that you can look for accidentally-dropped tools beside and under the vehicle , or read the owner 's manual while standing beside a car door . It 's almost certainly more useful than the description would lead you to believe , and light intensity , even at two car-lengths , is sufficient to permit you to read just about anything that might be useful , even 1/8-3/16 '' print . Current drain is a fraction of what an incandescent fixture requires for the same illumination ; I do n't even bother to leave the engine running anymore . It 's a remarkably handy light for working in the dark at distances of 20-80 feet , but remember that the fins on the back serve a purpose ; they keep the Cree elements cool , and therefore tend to get uncomfortably warm after a few minutes of use . All in all , though , I consider them an excellent choice , and intend to equip every vehicle I use for service and/or inspection with them .	1
This is quality . Ignore all the bad about this light if there is any . I do n't see why there would be.This is super bright , Easy to install , and will last forever if you take care of it ! A+++ Will buy more again !	1
lights up my whole neighbor hood there good to see light up sure they love the glare through the windows when i am coming by jajaja just kidding but they are very nice and easy to instal awesome lights for the buck thanks	1
it works great on my vt750dc shadow spirit ! ! its even brighter then i hoped for ! ! was able to fit it all in the head lamp ( not stock vtx head light ) it was very easy to set up ! plugged right in ! ! !	1
I order this products base on high volume of review stating they are working reliable . With attractive selling price and comment . I place an order to try on this HID kit . Installation only spend around 30 min . Its work straight ahead and bright . Now , over 2 months , it switch on instantly and lights up quickly . Its much reliable than most similar products in the market . I have no compliant of this HID . Less Expensive HID kit and works fine . Good Make . Try it , You will like it .	1
Anyone looking to go to HID Xenon headlights these are the lights for you ! It only took about 30 minutes to get them installed , and they are great !	1
good product , removed a lot of grime .	1
I ordered this because if you want a clay bar at a local retail store , you typically have to buy a $ 20 clay bar kit , which I did not need . I just wanted a clay bar , not a kit . Amazon to the rescue ! They actually sell just a clay bar , for about $ 12 less than a whole kit . I used this today on my wife 's 2000 Jetta and it worked well to restore the paint to a glass smooth finish . Followed up with some Meguiar 's Ultimate compound and Nu-Finish and the car looks almost new . Well worth the money . Plus I still have some left over since I cut it in half when I took it out of the package .	1
I have been using a clay bar to remove the surface grime from the paint on my car . Most of the bars I have used have been small , about 50 grams , and they get dirty very quickly and eventually I have to toss them . I saw this 100 gram bar advertised and ordered it as a replacement . I wish the bar was a little more pliable thus making it easier to kneed the bar when it gets dirty . I used a detailer to wet the surface and this bar to remove the grime . The results have been excellent . I find this bar last for about one car . If the paint was cleaner you might get a couple of jobs out of it.I recommend it though as it was better than the one that came with the kit.I also found that working on a small area , say 2 foot by 2 foot , is much better that trying to do a large area at one time .	1
I purchased two bars for my detail project . One was yellow and this one . The other one was only about 4 dollars more but I found this one to be a lot easier to work ( a bit softer ) and it held up better than the other one.I already bought another one for my other car and will continue to use this brand	1
Works great and is very cheap . I was amazed how much it picked up after a thorough car wash . I used soapy water and it worked just fine . I recommend to anyone . It was very easy and made a big difference .	1
Anyone detailer must have a clay bar . It is second to none in removing fall out . Try waxing your car ... .then wax your car after using this . The paint feels new .	1
ok heres how i used the clay bar on my 1999 tacoma start with a cool day so theres less evaporation wash the vehicle then with clean soap and water wash again while the soap is on the car slide the clay bar over a small section at a time then rinse do the entire car DONT DROP THE CLAY BAR ON THE GROUND ! as it will pick up debris from the ground then scratch the paint finish off with wax smooooth	1
Lasts a really , really long time . It stays hard and does n't disappear like a bar of soap like the ones that come in those Meguiars kits , etc . This is the clay bar to get .	1
What more to say . I have used a different clay bars but this one is priced better than most it seems and does the job well .	1
Works as good as any other clay bar I 've used , and the bag it comes in has a zip-loc style resealing strip on it , which is nice . I think I prefer lighter colored clays , though , since removed contaminants show up better .	1
When used according to directions this works great ! My disappointment and resulting 4 stars is due to the expense . Its a pretty small piece of clay for the money . Removing all grit from clay must be difficult as all clay bars are expensive . That said , if you have a lot of bugs stuck to your car or MC this will really do the job of removing them . In addition it is Ideal for cleaning lexan/plexiglass motorcycle windshields	1
This is a great product . I will be buying more soon so I have it on me . The clay is easily pliable and will clean up your paint easily . I like the blue color which makes it easy to see how much contamination is coming out of your paint . Use Meguiar 's Quik Detail spray as a lube . http : //www.amazon.com/Meguiars-Quik-Detailer-Mist-Wipe/dp/B0009IQX90/ref=pd_ys_sf_s_15684181_a1_8_p ? ie=UTF8 & refRID=1JF16Z2Y5AEKZ4PAPWNY	1
I was astonished at how smooth the paint on my brand new car felt after a clay bar treatment . Easy to use . Easy to clean and store in a separate baggie . Be sure to store with lube , or it sticks relentlessly to the bag it is stored in .	1
This is probably the best auto detailing clay on the market . I 've tried others , and well this one just seems to be a much better value than the others i have tried not to mention its a few dollars cheaper than the others that are out there and you get more of it . The clay is easy to work with and very pliable - not to hard and not to soft . Will for sure purchase more of it when i need it . Thanks !	1
I clayed my car before polishing and waxing and this stuff really gets the grit off the paint that you really cant see but can feel if you run your hands inside a plastic bag across the paint . I used a detailing spray after washing and drying the car and the paint was smooth as silk afterwards . I used half a bar and saved the other half .	1
I am using this specific brand and type of Castrol automatic transmission fluid for my 2005 Nissan Frontier 4.0l V-6 ( 120,000 miles and NO problems at all , like new ) . Come to find out from my Nissan Tech friend , this is the same oil the dealership buys in 55 gallon drums , and uses in there auto trans drain and refills . And I also found out that Castrol makes the trans fluid ( this one ) that goes into the Nissan labeled bottles sold at the dealership for $ 12 a quart ( Matic-J ) . Per there website , this fluid is a direct replacement for Nissan Matic-J , Matic-D , and Matic-K trans fluids . FYI , you need 4.5 quarts for a drain and refill on a 2005 Nissan Frontier.If your Nissan uses Matic-S , I do not believe this fluid will work in your vehicle . You might contact Castrol directly before purchasing to verify the compatibility . I listed the differences between the two below : Nissan Matic-J ( semi-synthetic automatic transmission fluid ) this one is being phased out to only Matic-SNissan Matic-S ( fully-synthetic automatic transmission fluid ) From what I was told by my Nissan Tech friend , if your owners manual states that your vehicle requires Matic-J fluid , then you can mix and use both Matic-J and Matic-S fluids in your transmission . BUT , if your owners manual states that your vehicle requires Matic-S fluid , then Matic-S fluid is the ONLY type of fluid that can be used in your transmission.Hope this help ! Go Amazon !	1
I purchased this tranny oil for my old man 's 87 Honda Odyssey . The Honda tranny oil was to expensive at the dealer so I did some research and found out that Castrol had a tranny oil that is OE to the Honda tranny oil tried and it worked perfectly.The car took ( 4.5 ) quarts for a drain and refill . I will purchase this product again when I do a tranny oil change at 30,000 thousand miles .	1
my honda crv shifts more better , smoother , i highly recommend this product to all who needs diy atf change on their japanese car .	1
I bought the Castrol Transmax Import in the case and did n't realize that within the case was a bag and a pull out drain spout . I purchased this because the lowest cost per quart price . I like the product , I use it in my Honda and Toyota vehicles . It is more work for me to use in this form but it was my mistake , I will pay a bit more next time , either a gallon container or regular quart size . For now , I am filling a quart bottle from this and transferring the quart bottle one at a time to my transmissions.UDPATE 10/26/13 : Just a little update about my experience with the 6 gallon box size . As I stated above , I have been transferring to a Castrol Transmax quart and filling my transmission in my cars . One thing I noticed is because the Castrol quart contaniners are black AND the Transmax is red , it is very hard to see the level as I fill in the quart container . Compared to standard engine oil quarts which one can easily see on the side of the container where the level of oil is in the container , I need a strong light from above so I can peak into the Castrol quart containers . Not a big deal except for an occassional overfilling , but just a FYI for others who are planning on ordering the box size.My future plan is to maybe continue buying this box if it still nets me the lowest $ /quart and then use a funnel and clean gallon container , like milk or vinegar container to transfer . Mark lines for different quart levels on the container . This will give me the best of both worlds , best quart value AND easy and clean transfers.I also looked into what I paid back on 5/13 and for everyone 's reference , it was $ 101 ( $ 4.20 per quart ) .Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you , it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews , and leave a comment if you have any questions , I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help .	1
The packaging is in good size . I emailed Castrol and confirmed that it also fits 2010 Mazda 5.Change over was easy at home , so far shifts are good , i suppose month will tell how it holds up.Original fluid smelled horrible and was black at just 30k km .	1
I use these retainers to replace the older ones on my Honda , Had no problems insert/ putting them in on the vehicle .	1
However , like many others who have purchased this type of fastener I got the wrong size . I need 10 mm . I played around with them and the look like they 'd be O.K . for interior panels but I doubt if they 'd be sturdy enough for mud flaps .	1
I used these to secure a new sideskirt on a Dodge Magnum . It took a little force to get them in the hole but they ended up working fine . Good price , too .	1
These are good to have when you loose the ones off your ATV while either riding in the woods or just out and about . Do n't cost that much and are worth a lot when you need em ' . I recommend anyone that have these installed on their ATV 's to get some to have for the future .	1
These are great to have around your garage , along with the sister product in 7mm . They appear to be a well made product , and the design is such that they give a good grip when activated . I normally use only OEM body clips , but I have a Suzuki automobile , which is pretty much no longer supported in the US market . So these have worked as a substitute for some of my Suzuki OEM fasteners .	1
Now I can replace the bad with the good & bought the pliers to remove instead of using side cutters to pry the heads up . There are lots of these on a Teryx .	1
great for what these were made for the price is also very good would tell anybody if you buy these you wont be sorry	1
Great non OEM replacement for Honda push rivets with the exception that its hard to reuse these once installed . They do not remove as easily as OEM , but for the price , I can throw a few away .	1
The oem tabs have a metal insert between the two pieces that make up the tab , these do not . They are all plastic . I replaced a couple on my front bumper and work just like the oem ones .	1
I had to remove the plastic cover underneath the engine in order to access the transmission fluid drain plug . Of course , I broke two of these clips in the process . While not identical , these fit perfectly and hold the plastic trim on firmly .	1
Honda price 1.50 - 3.50 ea . These are 13 cents each . made of tough nylon . Good to have handy around the shop . Enough said .	1
Too pressed for time , I ordered these to replace the 'exploding ' rivets in a Honda S2000 fender wells . Even if you use the correct tool/method , the factory rivets tend to break off into a head with a tiny stub when removed . I was thrilled to find these in semi-bulk at a good price.They looked like the same thing , and the factory service manual had only line drawings with no part numbers or dimensions . Only problem is , these are 10mm in diameter , not 8mm like I needed.So while they may fit some areas of the S2000 as listed on site , they do not fit everywhere the factory used nylon rivets.Five thumbs up for very good pricing ( and as always , lightning fast delivery ) as these fasteners can exceed $ 3.00 each at some other sites.I ca n't take away any stars because I was in a hurry , plus these rivets seem to be made of a more pliable plastic than the factory part , so if I do get to use them , they may be less prone to crack in use.Hopefully the correct rivets are on the way from another Amazon vendor-again at a the most reasonable price/quantity I could find anywhere.Moral : break out the caliper or ruler first to get the correct size before you buy- even if your application is listed .	1
These look , feel and work just like the originals clips on my 2005 Honda Odyssey . The clips holding the splash guard on the underside fall out and cause it to scrap on the road , forcing me to go to the dealer to replace them , so keeping these in the glove compartment saves me a lot of time !	1
Love the product , just wished I had gotten it earlier , I would recommend it to anyone wanting to replace the fastener on your vehicle	1
I have some 10mm holes around an access hole in my Sidekick body 's interior and I 'm making custom panels to cover them . I made the mistake of thinking that the holes were 8mm and first purchased 8mm clips . They were much less substantial than these which are very sturdy and should hold well .	1
These fasteners worked great on my 2011 Honda Accord . I had to take apart the bumper to add some screening and ended up replacing all of the OEM fasteners with these . When comparing these to the OEM fasteners , these felt to be of much better quality and held in tighter as well .	1
Honda uses these plastic lock rivets that are easy to get out but require a new one when putting the pieces back together.Make sure they are for your Honda or they wo n't fit right .	1
I recieved my unit , and it 's everything as listed . Came with the hitch strap , so I can use my truck to haul it to the waste site . Better price than the competions price . It came just in time too . Thanks Amazon !	1
Got it form a dealer going to wal -- mart to get a second fitting to complete the tank use it next weekend have been looking at this for a month	1
seals well , no leaks . I had it filled to near brim , the tank and its caps did not leak , pop off or create any spill disaster . It is a heavy monster when full and can be horsed around , but I am a 31 year old guy and it was very heavy . My dump station is only 75 feet away , uphill , and it was a struggle to move it on dirt . Filling and Dumping and rinsing were easy and strait forward.The supplied bit of hose and connector is a bad joke , I used my own 10ft section of rhinoflex with 2 female bayonet couplings for a solid lockup , I did want to recreate the Dump station scene from the movie RV ... .Next dump I will for sure employ the tow bar and a ATV for the moving , but I wanted to see if I could move it my self the first time .	1
I would 5 star this item if the hose supplied had 2 'end fittings ' instead of one . Where are you supposed to get the second fitting from ? In the end I had to buy a second hose from a local store and use the fitting from that to connect to the supplied hose . Dumb . Otherwise the unit works great . We have a camper on a fixed site and we get pumped out once a week - in season . At the end of October they stop pumping for the winter so we bought this item to transport waste to the dumping area . I just hook it up to the hitch on our golf cart and it tags along nicely . A really great product if only they would give you the extra fitting that you will need .	1
This is functional as I wanted it to be . It is a bit heavy when near full but that 's gravity and no blame to this . I have n't tried towing it behind the car as the dump station is within easy walking distance . The hook up works well . I did fabricate a shorter main line to run from RV to tank . The little hose to connect to rinse the tank will likely work well if I ever find a hose at a dump station that has n't had the threaded end run over repeatedly to the ruination of connectability .	1
I ordered these bulbs for my buddy and me . We put them in our Silverado trucks as interior lighting . It makes the inside light up .	1
First thing I did was test each one , and all 10 worked.PRO:1 . Arrived on time.2 . They all work , sometimes the Chinese quality control department misses a few.3 . Bright , but not too bright and they are super white.4 . I have spares.CON:1 . When viewed from the side , you see a small 'dot ' not an overall white glowing light , so be prepared for that.2 . More bulbs than I needed , but it was cheaper to buy this pack than to buy one at a time.Peace !	1
These lights are brighter than the bulbs I replaced in my 44 year car about 20 years ago , but it is only the color that makes the instrument cluster easier to see , not the brightness . The price however was outstanding , the quality is yet to be seen . I went to great pains not to touch the chips with my bare hands so as not to damage the sets longevity issues . We will see how they last for me .	1
Using them to replace the lights in the car . Had no problem in installing them in the light holders . They plug right in.Would recommend them	1
works great in the license plate socket . get a pack and give some to friends . You 'll make their day and the police will see their plates easily ... lol	1
This is a no-brainer update for your car . I 've purchased a couple different types , all of similar quality and brightness , but all of slightly different colors . These cast superior light to that of incandescent , and use drastically less power consumption .	1
I replaced my bed lights with a couple of these and they are ok . I was hoping for something a little brighter but the do n't list the lumens .	1
Good little package , delivered fast , and I can use it for many years . I 'm pretty happy about this purchase . The quality was & # 34 ; well made and consistent & # 34 ; .	1
They are bright little bulbs , not too much blue tint . Perfect for license plate lights .	1
White light comes out of these bad boys , not blue . Very bright and attractive . All of mine work ( fingers crossed that they do n't die ) . Only issue is alot of my old bulbs broke off in the socket , so these do n't work until i clear the debris *sigh*	1
So far so Good ! All the bulbs worked out of the package . Brighter and whiter than the incan . OEM bulbs . replaced the following on the Prius : front side marker ( 2 ) lic . plate ( 2 ) front map and dome lights ( 3 ) door lights ( 2 ) Only time will tell if it will last or if will be safe for my plastics . I believe this smaller LED size will be fine . There are larger and more powerful versions out there . But , you run the risk of the bulb generating too much heat and melting the plastic .	1
Lights are bright well constructed . Perfect for interior replacement bulbs . Also worked well for running lights and license plate bulbs .	1
Great stuff and really bright , but also the price is so amazing on these . Definitely , would buy these again for my cars .	1
These are bright white light with a hint of blue . Fits perfectly in most of my 2012 highlander interior lights . Had to adjust them a bit to make them work for the front as these are a bit longer and gets in the way of the on/off switch .	1
Update.The reason I was having cleaning problems with these wiper blades is because their OLD . I went to an auto store and replaced them and was informed of this ... I noticed a color difference on the rubber part of the blade , these wipers were faded compared to actual fresh ones.I would recommend spending a few more dollars at a store to get new ones , or get the cheaper ones they work better then these . In my case.Now I 'm out twenty bucks plus the price of the new ones .	-1
It was not clear from the product description but these are fully enclosed blades designed to keep ice from causing them to lose contact . I live in a part of Arizona where I do n't need that . Also , these are about the ugliest blades I 've ever seen , big and blocky . I 'm sure they work great in snow and ice but I do n't need that . Also , they do n't flex out at the tip as much as regular blades . The the outer 3 & # 34 ; did not even touch on the passenger side of my 2001 Tundra windshield with the blade at rest .	-1
Thought this might have been because the wiper arm itself was bent . Put the old blade back on and it hits the spot fine . Using on a 2009 Camry . Tried bending the blade a bit to no avail , still misses a huge spot right in the middle on the drivers side part of the window . Will have to order a new one but will make sure it 's a different brand .	-1
I have had good luck with Bosch wipers in the past but these do a terrible job and leave tons of streaks in the top half of the wiper arc . I will be trying a different brand next time out.EDIT : I replaced these with some Rain-X Weatherbeater wipers and the improvement is drastic . Stay away from the Bosch wipers and spend your money on something that actually works as intended .	-1
Just installed this on my wife 's 2004 Toyota 4runner and yes it fits , even though Amazon says it does n't . With that said , they seem like good wipers I noticed a little bit of squealing from the driver side one , but that could b/c the windshield needs cleaning or there was n't enough rain on it at the time.Update- So after having them installed for over a month now , these wipers have a faint squeal to them constantly which can be annoying . I have the ones that are step up from these on my truck and they do n't squeal . So in my opinion it 's worth spending a little more and getting the nicer ones.Update-2- on a Toyota 4runner these things suck . Will definitely not buy these again .	-1
I bought a set in May 2014 and installed them . No issues installing them . I inspected them on July 12 , 2014 and found the wiper edges on both Driver and Passanger side were separating from main rubber part of the blade . I live in Arizona and the weather is has been hot but not so hot to make both of these blades disintegrate after less than 2 months on the car . When the rain hit my worst fears were confirmed as the wipers did not wipe away the rain from the windshield like they should have.Do n't buy this inferior product ! !	-1
I was super excited to get this and try it out , unfortunately despite detailed research regarding the proper size to get for my vehicle , the attachment system is TOTALLY different than what is on my car . Very disappointing , as this was a very high-quality wiper .	-1
Unfortunately , I believe they sent me a return/refurb product . You know that `` need a chainsaw to cut open melted plastic security packaging '' we all love to hate that electronics seemed to be packed in ? Well , this came in that , however , there was a cut about 3/4 the way up the package ... just enough to pull the unit out and put the unit back in its packaging . The box it was delivered in showed no signs of damage and that security plastic of death just ca n't rip on its own.Secondly , I was amazed to find 2 missing components ( wondering if it is standard for all of this type , or if it was just missing in mine ) : screws to permanently mount and most importantly an insulated copper wire to ground the unit . If you 're going to give us the option to screw it down in a vehicle , then supply the screws . If you are going to sell a product that should be grounded , then help your customer by supplying that ground wire for crying out loud.It 's also very important to note this can only supply 140W of power when using the in car power plug ( ie , for your radar detector etc ) . The only way you get to 400W is direct connect to the cars battery.I do like the fact that it has dual AC sockets , however , it really needs more than a single USB plug . My intended use would be for trips and with only one USB charger , that does n't work when you have more than one kiddo.I would recommend either going to a different model with more ports if you have kids .	-1
This is the second type of LED light I have tested . I ordered 2 of these lights . I measured the Voltage and current at each light . Each light came from different suppliers.LED Light 112.612V @ 1.711A = 21.579 WattsLED Light 212.581V @ 1.723A = 21.677 WattsThese lights are bright but the DC-DC converter is probably running too low.These might be B stock.While I wrote this review I left LED light 2 on to see what would happen when they got warm.LED Light 212.638V @ 1.638A = 20.701 WattsI was going to give these 2 stars but I received a refurbished unit . I sent it back because the lense was cracked and had a poor repair job . The lenses have to be super cheap I dont know why they bother repairing them.EDIT : Careful with the lense cover . I cleaned mine and now it has a white haze to it .	-1
These were easy to break and they did not fit my 2008 Honda Civic . The description of the product needs to be changed so people do n't end up buying this and it does n't fit their vehicle .	-1
Do n't buy this tank ; there are several out there much better designed . Hard to handle ; have to lift front to drain ; make a mess . Hard to pull when full . Buy tank with 4 wheels that you do n't have to lift front to pull - ones that work like kids wagon and that can be drained laying flat .	-1
Not only was it a disappointment it was a serious one . No fault of the light as it worked just fine . The difference between this bulb and the ones that came with the RV was literally night and day . With these LED bulbs installed the best I can compare it to is a moonlit night . No way I could read , cook , or do anything with these installed after the sun has set . As said , this is n't the bulbs fault because it worked as advertised .	-1
Ive bought SMDs countless times on amazon and I want the whitest SMD possible . I was replacing the gauge cluster bulbs in a '98 Camry and needed a few more . I wanted small ones with less SMDs since I wasnt sure about the depth for the bulb so I figured this kit would be fine.To be blunt , they work , well most of them . Some of them had the top SMD blown out but it wasnt too noticeable in the cluster . They all turned on and the cluster looks a lot better but not much brighter than the factor bulbs.The Jtechs are also in the 8000k range which I dont like . 8000K is white with a lot of blue , probably the closest thing to a solid blue LED . I definitely do not recommend these for license plate or parking lights since theyll attract too much attention and arent very bright . If youre replacing gauge cluster bulbs then theyll be fine .	-1
I installed one of these LEDs to replace a blown LED side light in Porsche Cayenne . The bulb illuminates and is bright white , however it triggers a warning message to check side light . While these bulbs are very low cost , and I 'd recommend them for a standard application , these do n't appear to be suitable for an error-free application requiring a CANBUS built-in load resistor .	-1
Maybe other people will have different results , but I was extremely disappointed . I bought these bulbs to replace the fairly dim bulbs in the dash of my 1996 Ford pickup , which has 194 style bulbs . I had already replaced my dash bulbs with the & # 34 ; high output & # 34 ; filament type 194 bulbs . They still were n't bright enough for me , so I decided on LED 's . These Jtech 5smd bulbs were a VERY slight improvement , but not worth the trouble . The bulbs have some SERIOUS drawbacks : First , these bulbs are POLARIZED ! ! meaning , they only work in one direction in the vehicle . Most dash lights that use 194 bulbs are n't always going to light up all the time- I wanted to replace the very dim warning lights as well-you ca n't just make all the warning lights come on -- there 's no way to tell for sure that you have installed the bulbs correctly . There is no indicator on the bulb to denote which side is to be for positive and which side is to be for negative . I had to remove all but the illumination bulbs , which I was able to check the function of.Second , the bulbs are very flimsy and not well constructed . The led portion is not very securely fastened to the plastic socket assembly . Additionally , the & # 34 ; plug & # 34 ; uses cheap ultra-thin wire as the contact , which is very easily bent out of position . You must ensure that the wire is in exactly the right position , and if you have to bend it very far , it will break . I have very little to believe that these bulbs will last any length of time at all . One of my dash bulbs has failed in less than ONE MONTH ! ! ! Third , and this is my fault for buying the wrong style led , not the manufacturer 's fault ; only the flat & # 34 ; top & # 34 ; portion of the LED actually does anything if you 're trying to use these for a dash illumination application . These might work where there is 360 degree unobstructed area around the bulb , but even when used in a reflector in the map light of my little Toyota , the light output is scarcely more than the 194 filament bulb that it replaced . There are LED 's with 4 or even 8 SMD led 's that are mounted flat on the top of the plastic plug assembly -- this is what you want for directional light output.Bottom line , if you 're looking to purchase the least expensive LED bulb , this is it . If you are looking for a well-constructed , bright bulb to replace your dash lights , this is NOT the bulb you are looking for . To be fair , these bulbs would work fine if you 're not needing a directional output light , and where you can check that the polarity of the bulb is correct before trusting it to work .	-1
I tried this after a friend recommended it to me , saying t lasted a few weeks and had good shine.More so then any other tire shine I have used , you MUST make sure your tires are 100 % clean . If not , after applying this product , you will get brownish stains on your tires . So use a good tire cleaner or degreaser to prepare it for the shine coating.It has more of a matte finish then a glossy shine , even after duplicate coats . It seems to contain a large percentage of alcohol , as it flashes dry rather shortly after spraying it . It also did not last long for me , only a few days at best.Not worth the effort , there is much better on the market . I like Megs Endurance for an OTC product , and Ultima Trim and Tire Guard for a mail order product .	-1
I followed the instructions , cleaned the tire with a bristle brush and soap ... dried it with towels . Then I applied the product . This morning , my tires have a thick , plastic feeling brown residue all over ... looks like rust mixed with mud . When I used this stuff before , it never left a brown residue , just a horrible attempt at a shine.Overall this product sucks , and now I need to figure out how to remove the brown reside it left . Sticking with McGuires from now on ...	-1
I bought this product ( two cans ) a few weeks ago from another site and it is not what it claims to be.It left a white gummy residue on my tires and no shine . I eventually had to return one can .	-1
Lamps did not fit as promised , should of returned them but too late now ! Did not fit the socket for the lamp on any light of the car .	-1
I bought these lights to replace the 20W lights in my camper . I have already bought a couple of LED lights elsewhere and I am very happy with them but the cost was too high to replace them all in my camper . I bought these 2 lights to try before buying a 20 set . The first thing to watch out for is the wires on both of these lights were crossed when I tried to install them the first time . This resulted in a quick pop and a little char on the light fixture . I removed the lights and bent what was left of the wires into place . The second try worked well . The resulting light is very blue and nowhere near as bright as my other LED lights . They are not completely unpleasant but are more like night lights than reading lights . I did n't want to waste the bulbs so I moved them to the bathroom where we leave the lights on all night . I will not be buying any more and would only recommend them for landscape lighting or night lights .	-1
Update . I went to a drive through car wash and to my surprise the car wash bent the front license plate all up . I removed it and straightened it back up and tried to put the plugs through the bottom the license plate but the things ripped right off . I was pretty pissed . $ 20 piece of rubber used for protection that cant even be installed with out malfunctioning . Then while poking a hole so can run a screw on the bottom the screw cover piece of rubber ripped off . I lost faith in this for protection . I ended up using zip ties to keep the bottom from being lifted up at the car wash.The company also gives you I think $ 5 to write a review if you purchase one , but do yourself a favor and just buy something elseSo I put this on a 12 kia optima . Here in Cali you got ta have the front plates so I was on a search for thick license plate frames and stumbled across this on amazon . It 's not a bad price after seeing the little thin ones that offer no protection at autozone for about 10-15 . I have n't tested it but I 'm sure if I was to go battle with shopping carts the bumper will be protected . As long as I hit it dead center with the rubber frame.I was debating going with the HD frame but could n't justify spending $ 20 more on a 1/4 '' of rubber	-1
the first one exploded when i accidentally reversed the polarity and the second i bought the switch to turn on the usb does n't usually work with out being fliped back and forth a few times and sometimes even then needs pressure on it to stay on . the screw that holds the bracket together rusted and now i need to change it with a stainless one . cheap fixes but still a pain from a new product .	-1
I purchased these extenders for $ 26 , I blieve and took them to Discount Tire to have them put on my dually motor home . They had a difficult time putting them on . After they installed them the tires leaked all the air and went down 20 pound of air pressure . Luckily , while on my trip I notice the back drivers side tire was low . A Tire Company I took the motor home to check why the tire was low , took it off and showed me that the ends of the extensions were crushed and causing the problem . They checked the tire by submerging it into a water tank and there was nothing wrong with the tire Had them remove the extensions and did n't have any more problems on 4K mile trip .	-1
These did not work for my car , even though they are supposed to be compatible . Be careful , and make sure you properly install them .	-1
I have a 2003 Chevrolet Tahoe and these backup bulbs will not fit into the sockets . This was a total waste of time and I returned them for a refund .	-1
I do not know how bright they are because they did not fit any light assembly on the car ! Uhg !	-1
These work as a 3156 backup light but not a 3157 . My 96 F350 needs 3157 for running , turn , and break lights . These do n't work . I plugged them into my backup light 3156 and they did work .	-1
Installed one , then compared the brightness ( at night ) . Very lilttle if any difference between this bulb and the 4 year old OEM on he other side . Dissapointed .	-1
Did't work the plugs were off set and the fuses will not plug into them . Thanks to Amazon for refunding me my purchase price because all they did was take up room in my garbage can . DO NOT BUY THESE unless you plan on throwing your money away .	-1
I waited for actual snow before writing this review , it 's snowed about 3 inches so I unpackaged this unit donned my gloves and hat and set forth to clear my car . There are two clips on the unit where the handle is stored , unclipped the handle and adjusted for size . ( I have a small SUV ) First setback was the units handle locking and unlocking system is tight and secure , really really tight and secure ! After some grunting and twisting I got the thing set up . When tight , unlike the photo the scraper is at a 90 degree angle to the snow pusher ( more on this later ) . The foam snow pusher actually did a good job and cleared snow cleanly with no marring , it seemed to hold up to the usual edges and bumps from wipers , antennas , etc . and the length made the job quick.After snow removal I used the scraper end to get the light coat of ice off the windows . Because the foam pusher end is at 90 degrees to the scraper you end up trying to manage scraping with a wet 18 inch or so pusher end oriented up and down dripping icy water on you while trying to scrape horizontally . Trying to unlock the handle for storage with wet cold gloves was an exercise in frustration I managed it by sitting in my car for some leverage . Now I 'm no weakling but I ca n't imagine a slightly built person or a lessor grip actually adjusting this thing on a cold dark wet icy morning with cold wet fingers . I was soaked by the time I was done.Overall , a good idea , but poor execution .	-1
Wiper came loose and allow arm to scratch wind shield . I even check several times to made sure wipers are attached securely . Lousy design .	-1
I removed the driver 's side wiper blade from my pick-up . I was unable to install the ACDelco with any of the adapters that were furnished . I went to the Amazon web site and entered the information for my vehicle and the response was that this wiper blade was a match for my vehicle . So , it must be just me that ca n't get it installed and I need to try a different approach.I took my Frontier back to the Nissan dealer where I purchased the vehicle . I asked the dealer to install the wiper blade and while there go ahead and change the oil and rotate the tires . The dealer did the oil and tire thing as usual but was unable to get the ACDelco blade to work . I asked him to put my original blade back on , which he did , and I recycled the ACDelco.Against the advice I did look this gift horse in the mouth and it had no teeth .	-1
The wiper comes with several adapters , and you have to choose the one that 's right for your car . Unfortunately for me , the one that 's right for my car is HUGE ... and very distracting.I noticed it right away , as soon as I sat in the driver 's seat . It actually impinged on my vision just a little on the bottom of the windshield -- it had a higher profile than my other wiper ( which I left on the passenger side for comparison purposes ) , and it was just distracting because of its bulbous shape . When I turned on the wipers , I actually felt like it was dangerous , because it was such a focal point that my eyes kept going to the adapter while I was driving in the rain ... every time the wiper went by , I could n't help but notice it again . Like a giant black bug or something -- you just ca n't NOT notice it . I hoped it would get more invisible to me as I got used to it and continued driving ( it was a long drive home ) , but that did n't happen.It makes very good contact with the windshield and worked well , with no missed spots on the windshield . I 'm guessing that if you needed any other adapter than the one I needed , you 'd probably be fine -- but the one I needed just made it too much of an eyesore.I had already thrown out the old wiper , so I 'm out of luck and need to buy another one now .	-1
These wipers require replacing the entire wiper component , not just the plastic part . So the first difficulty I ran into was figuring out how to get the original ones off , as this is n't even in my car manual . Had to google it to find out how to do it . Then to put the blades on , you have to figure out which adapter to use and how to snap it into place . The directions for this are ridiculously small and impossible to decipher , so it 's pretty much a trial and error thing . Once I got it snapped on , I was able to put the blade on , and it seemed to work reasonably well enough for a couple weeks . That was , until I was driving in a slight drizzle , turned on my wipers , and I guess the window had some dry spots that caused the blade to stick a little bit and the connector just snapped off , sending the entire blade flying through the air . Thankfully it did n't hit anyone , or another car , or I could have had some real damages to pay . Luckily I saved the original wipers which went back on the car ASAP . These went into the garbage . I will note that my wipers use the J-style connector , and another reviewer mentioned a similar issue with their car and the same style connector , so it may be a particular issue with this one . However , I am just not sure I would trust these wipers and these connectors that are n't permanently attached to the wiper and prone to just snapping apart .	-1
These ACDelco wiper blades ship with multiple adapters so they will fit a variety of vehicles . The installation directions cryptic and virtually useless . I wish I 'd noticed the videos provided on the product page before I did my install.The adapters are bulky in size and are noticeably distracting in your field of vision when you 're driving . Furthermore , both the adapters and the blades are made of plastic similar to what you 'd expect from a Chinese made dollar store toy . The blades feel super flimsy and do not even have the strength to hold the wiper against the curve of the windshield from end to end . The actual rubber wiper does a decent job , where it touches the glass.These blades come equipped with a wear indicator that is supposed to let you know when it is time to replace the blade . I do not have any expectation that the blade will actually last long enough for that indicator to be needed . *This review applies to both of the two different lengths of blades I tested*	-1
I was personally quite disappointed with this oil . After getting my new bike and filling it with the other Castrol 4T Mineral based 4-stroke motorcycle oil , it ran smooth and shifted with little effort.But this synthetic stuff is just terrible in comparison . Hard shifts , missed shifts.Just not for my 1 cylinder push rod 4 stroke 250cc wet clutch .	-1
This thing is so Bulky and Heavy and unbalanced.. I took it out of the box and put it back . This would be good for nothing more than taking off lug nuts once a year for a rotation . There are smaller , more powerful electric impact guns on the market that you can fit inside a wheel well let alone an engine compartment .	-1
Im very disappointed in this wrench . The 12 volt wrench like this is better ... go figure ! I just performed a strut job on my toyota and it had troubles breaking the bolts off and the 12 volt could break em . Im glad i decided to purchase the 12 volt version of this as well . The clicking of the 12 volt drives me nuts but at least i know them bolts or nuts are coming off . I guess this wrench needs more power or sum thin . Im not sure it just does n't work well . Ik already i will be using the cheaper impact as its more handy because of its compact size compared to this and it just works better . I guess i will just keep it for backup . Good luck on who else decides to purchase this . Maybe you will have better luck !	-1
I 've been using microfiber towels for years . They are absolutely the best way to wash and wax your car . Before discovering the Heininger towels , I used the `` standard '' yellow ones . They do a good job and are n't very expensive . When I got the Heininger towels , I expected them to be very similar to the pile of microfiber wipes that I own . I could n't be more wrong . These towels are actually different ! I figured that microfiber is a commodity and that one brand is pretty much the same as another . This one is n't . The towels are noticeably thicker , softer , and more absorbent . One of these towels lasts as long as two of the others when I am drying the car . They wash clean on the permanent press washer cycle and dry on the `` warm '' setting on my electric dryer . At about $ 1.75 each , they are reasonably priced . Personally , I prefer the light colored towels that show any dirt picked up more easily . The dark ones tend to hide the dirt . A dirty towel can scratch your car 's finish . Try these . They are absolutely great.NEW INFORMATION 5/16/2013Now that I have had these a while , some serious problems have emerged:1 . These towels are not very absorbent . I have a couple of dozen of the basic `` yellow '' microfiber cloths . They soak up the water ! I tried these and they did n't drink very much . I washed them and they still do n't begin to compare with their competition . It took a while to learn this due to the very rainy weather here.2 . They shrunk ! The cloths started off being a nice size and very thick . After one wash they are now smaller than my old cloths.As a result of these issued , I have removed some stars .	-1
I use microfiber cloths almost exclusively for most household , garage and woodworking uses . From cleaning stove tops , car glass , windows , wiping dust off just sanded woodwork , etc . I currently have two other brands in house , both purchased in 36 packs so I welcomed the chance to test this product head to head in all the usual daily uses mentioned . Physically these are the same size , same make-up ( 80 % -20 % ) and subjectively nearly the same knapp or feel to hand as the other products . They performed exactly the same both wet and dry , rinsed the same and dried in the same amount of time . Other than color , I could detect no difference . So why only 2 stars ? These are nearly 4 times the price of the other brands tested per cloth.Make no mistake , these are top quality microfiber clothes , fluffy and not thin , do everything well and rinse easily . But so do the other brands and they do it much much less expensively .	-1
these micrfibres are meh for removing wax , make you work harder than you need to . I tried them out because they were a good price but I would n't buy them again . I also tried using them to quick-wax the car & it just seems to move the fluid around the paint , and does n't take it off . it worked a bit better after I soaked them in Pinnacle Microfibre detergent , but I recommend the Meguiars X4014 10000000 times over these , you get what you pay for !	-1
Unfortunately I was feeling cheap when I decided to replace all my bulbs . Now everything flickers . I feel like there is a disco going on when they are in use.. just pay a little extra for some quality , your not going to be happy for very long with these .	-1
Product worked for a week fine . After that the bluetooth would not pair , tried all codes and different devices but would not work . Do n't buy .	-1
You have wait till its dark to know if these are on or not , cant see them at all in the daytime .	-1
I simply can not recommend these for reverse bulbs . Both bulbs had MOST of the LED not working and they are no where near as bright as the factory bulbs ... probably due to the led not lighting up .	-1
I really wonder about the good reviews this seat cover gets . The back part of the seat cover is made of women 's panty hose . One of the ones I received was ripped out of the box . The front part you sit on is tough enough but its attached to nylon back same as panty hose I kid you not . $ 20 worth of aggravation is what you get . Mine is being returned at no cost thanks to Amazon . Really now , when I ask for canvas tough seat cover this is more like the seat cover for drug store cowboys . It wo n't last..It wont wear through though , it will just come apart the stitching . Its like stitching toilet paper to saddle leather , just not going work.Be careful installing , rips easy.. One of mine was ripped out of the box.I hope we did n't make this here in the USA , shame shame.. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -3rd time 's a charm : June 11Continuation of the Dickie 's Seat Cover Saga ; I got another one in the mail today , IT RIPPED ALSO putting it on worse than the other one , that came ripped.No way these will hold up , sent them all three back two ripped and one very carefully re-boxed . This 3rd one did not rip at the panty hose material seem but right in the but area where the canvas is sewn together where you sit . Really bad Dickie 's . I did not sit in it , happened during install ripped completely out.I WAS BEING CAREFUL installing ; so there ! Pretty good seat cover for all you DRUG STORE COWBOYS..Worth the $ 20 no..Poor Dickie 's must be hurting..	-1
This gauge is terrible . It does not inflate well , the trigger pull is tiny , your hands will cramp up before something is inflated , even a soccer ball took minutes to inflate . Trust me , view what other customers viewed after this item and try those . Pass on this , do n't get suckered in by the low price .	-1
There are some confusing reviews for this product that made me curious enough to buy it . To clear up the confusion : this tire inflator does not readily work with Presta valves and it does not ship with an adapter , so you will have to get your own adapter . I am primarily using it for my bike tires that are rated 110 to 140psi - my compressor produces about 110 psi , maybe a bit more . Even though this inflator is only rated up to 100psi , I with the 200psi gauge this allows me to check and correct the tire pressure quickly.I tried the inflator with a car tire and noticed that the mechanism that clips it to the valve is a bit unusual ( and flimsy/cheap ) . Air will escape unless the hose is held totally straight and there is no lateral force to the connection . This is a bit difficult to achieve . This is no different when I use it with the Presta adapter . I am not sure I would order this product again .	-1
They look fine for a few minutes after turning them on , but then they turn a very undesirable shade of purple-ish blue . I ordered four ( two packs of two ) and all of them did this . In contrast , the 42-SMD model works great . I replaced all the bulbs in my camper with those ( about 16 total ) , have been running them for hours , and they put out a much more pleasant white light . The brightness of the 42-SMDs is about the same as the 68-SMDs anyway , if not a bit brighter .	-1
Weak implementation of a mediocre design .	-1
Smaller than expected , but pretty thin ... noticing plenty of lint too . I do n't think they 're worth the savings ... .I 'd rather pay more and have a much better product .	-1
I was hoping for something that would easily and quickly remove water spots . While it will remove water spots that are very light , you can get the same or better results using a paste/liquid wax that has some built-in cleaning/polishing agents . The Meguiar 's Water Spot Remover did not work on some water spots in one of our sinks and the water spots were fresh . I used a polishing/cleaner wax and was able to remove the water spots . I think Meguiar needs to spend more time at the company and less time out with his show . Lately I am finding that about 1/2 the Meguiar 's products I buy are a waste of money and I can find a better product from a competitor . A few of Meguiar 's products are really good , this is not one of them .	-1
Well this was a waste of time . I tried it twice and did n't get any better . And on the package it says & # 34 ; Guaranteed to remove your oxidation or your money back . How can I get my money back ? I do n't know if I should try another brand .	-1
Ehhhh , what can I say , it 's black paste . There is n't a & # 34 ; wow & # 34 ; factor here and the instructions kind of scare me about getting it on anything but black paint . So far not impressed . It comes in a paste tube which cracks easy and allowed oil from the wax to leak out . Appication is easy as usual and it gives a good decent darker shine . Not what I would call a & # 34 ; wet shine & # 34 ; . I think the idea here is that this will cover scratches or swirls on black paint ; not what happens in reality . Not feeling this one folks .	-1
I have been waxing cars for the better part of 35 years . Maybe it was just the car I used this on , but I was not impressed at all with this.The tech wax and number 7 glaze for sure worked better on my Mini . I found this hard to remove and it had a lot of smudges to it . I tried it by hand and also with a machine , still had poor results and will re do the car today . I am going to give it a try on another dark car I have and see if it is any better , but for now this does not work for me , and I use almost all of Meguars products with no issues .	-1
I had this Cup Holder for about 2 weeks before the bolt that held the up came loose and my cup fell off . I was so mad . When you get it make sure every bolt is tight or you will loose it .	-1
Being that this only comes in one size that 's a big downside . I hope to see 3M make other sizes available for bigger applications like most people are doing . I installed this in the trunk of my vehicle and did not notice a big difference in road noise reduction . I think there are better alternatives . I 've seen big mats and bigger rolls through other vendors online . Overall , unless this is just for around speakers I do n't think this will fit many applications unless you want to buy a lot , but if you are buying a lot there are some other semi and custom products to fit your exact need .	-1
These sound proofing mats are extremely stiff . I wanted to use them in my vehicle 's tailgate . I took the precaution of taking a hair dryer out to warm them up so they would fit securely since the flooring has some very wide grooves . Even with that these would not conform to the flooring , they lay on top.It would take several more purchases in order to cover the whole area ; there are numerous other products out there that seem more reasonable in cost . With this partial coverage there is no difference in the sound level and I have no confidence that these will stay on with the constant loading and unloading of items , since they refuse to stick to the whole flooring , but just the tops of the wide grooved surface - wish they would state that surface must be completely flat . It does show the mat bending to the curve and bumps of a door in their directions - sure did n't work for me .	-1
These are basically cheap made in China microfiber towels . Each one has a label on it in addition to edging , both of which I believe can scratch your paint.You are MUCH better of with edgeless higher quality microfiber towels .	-1
My car has little door for the port to plug in this one , but this guy is too big so I can not close that door . Looking for smaller alternative .	-1
The picture shows white plastic bottles , I did not receive these . The picture of this product would make one beleieve that these are thick plastic bottles . The bottles that I received where not marked in any way to show that they are from chemical guys and they are clear plastic . The sprayers that were included with my bottles do not turn off when you tighten down the nozzle either .	-1
The green section is open cell foam like the dark gray foam , although a little denser , but being open cell , does n't stop dressing chemical from soaking through to your fingers .	-1
What you want is a Blutooth version of this device , and an old Andriod device or cracked iphone to use the blutooth function . FU Apple for .Connecting this using WiFi makes your phone useless . You will not be able to connect to the internet using your LTE if you have an iPhone , it tries to connect through the WiFi , which is connected to this device.I tried using Engine Link software , and was not happy with it . That did not sense my fuel tank and flow functions .	-1
I had some plans for this that included a Vanguard GAEMS portable gaming system ( suitcase with a 19 '' monitor in there that also mounts an Xbox or such inside for portable gaming ) . The Xbox itself uses 175W , the monitor a fraction of that . Yet this would power neither of them . Not concurrently , nor individually . Nada.I pulled my Harmony remote charging base in the car , tried that , and that would power , so I knew the inverter at least works , and is n't defective.USB charging worked for my tablets and my phone , although it 's far more convenient for me to use my dual USB cigarette adapter for things like that , rather than the large box here.The other major complaint I had is the short cable for the cigarette lighter . Give me something long enough to reach the back of my SUV where I 'm more likely to have things set up that need AC power . The provided cable was n't even long enough to reach from the center mounted dash cigarette jack to the armrest between the seats - a short straight shot . I had just enough to reach to put the unit on one of the front seats , that was it . And since not all vehicles have a rear mounted cigarette plug ( something I think all auto makers should do ) I have no else I can plug it in.Had it worked , I probably would 've given it 4 stars , taking one off for the shot cord . But since this 500W unit could n't even power something at about 30W , let alone something that 's only using 175W , it 's completely useless .	-1
This is unbelievable , I thought I was buying from a reputable brand . This is my 2nd energizer ( Or I guess Power Bright is their manufacturer ) inverter . I got the 1st one earlier this week . It was returned the day it was received because one of the 120V wires coming off the main board has n't attached , it had come off ( It was holding on by 1 strand ) . The replacement came in today , first thing I checked was that wire through the grill slots , it was attached . Plugged it in to my car battery ( via the attached clips ) , powered up just find . Attached a 50w LED work light ( 50 watts load at the plug , not 50 watts light output ) , worked just fine . Fan did n't power up . Attached a 175-200 watt load ( my Dremel Rotary Tool , it pulls 1.5A ( I 've tested this with a DMM ) ) with the LED light . There was a sizable arc inside the unit . It continued to arc , followed quickly by a FIRE and a lot of smoke until I removed the positive terminal of the battery from it . Looked like a fool trying to blow through the fan opening to put it out , then quickly snapped a pic with my phone..unbelievable . This is suppose to have the usual safety circuitry built in , NONE of it worked as designed , it continued to short internally with my battery connected . This is a DANGER to anybody who uses it with high loads . I seriously question the engineering design and manufacturing if I had 1 dead on arrival and the 2nd caught on fire due to some internal fault ( I 'm not going to take it apart to see which component failed ) . Its totally unacceptable.Oh and if anybody says that dremel was too much for it . I 've measured it pulling 1.55A at 110V ( modified AC sin wave ) from my Cobra 500watt power inverter I have permanently mounted in my car , you know the $ 25 dollar one on amazon right now . I use it on that thing frequently with no issues . I stepped up to energizer thinking it would be a good product , but the dirt cheap one that I 've had a year or 2 works better .	-1
It works good just as most of the reviewers have said , but the one I got stunk very badly when I took it out of the box . The smell is similar to the smell that I have found on shoes , tools and other products that came from China ( appears to be something in the plastic/glue they use ) . I 'm a smoker so my smeller is not too good , but I can smell this thing from across the room . I 'm surprised , because I read a lot of the reviews before I bought this thing and I do n't remember anything about it smelling , so maybe I got a bad one . I 've had this thing out of the box for several days now , but the smell is just as powerful as the day I opened the box for the 1st time . I 'll be keeping it because it will be used mostly outdoors were it do n't smell as badly , but I wo n't be buying another or recommending this thing !	-1
This inverter is non-sinusoidal . Basically , this makes it unfit for your expensive electronics like laptops . I plugged my MacBook Pro AC adaptor/charger into this thing and it flashed my screen like a Christmas light . I hope it 's not damaged.It comes in one of those cursed welded plastic display hangers that you have to destroy to open . That 's ok though because I feel sorry for anyone that would buy this P.O.S . junk from China . Live and learn .	-1
I was looking forward to reviewing this because we had such great luck usingRain-X 800002243-12PK Original Glass Treatment - 7 oz. , ( Pack of 12 ) on the same car for a cross-country drive last fall but had left the bottle at home.Superficially , the two products are similar . Both apply easily , and are easily wiped clear after drying.There , the similarities end . Although the Griot 's Glass Sealant does help rainwater bead on the windshield , the beads are large , and do n't easily move themselves out of the field of view . Rain-X , on the other hand , creates a myriad of extremely tiny rainwater beads that all immediately migrate off the windshield , making it unnecessary to even turn on the windshield wipers at highway speeds.We did notice e Griot 's Glass Sealant helped smooth and quiet the motion of the windshield wipers during rain , but there was no chance of leaving the wipers off even in a light mist.I wonder if perhaps this Griot 's product might be better suited for folks wanting a show car windshield to look its absolute best , as opposed to someone like me just looking for an equivalent of Rain-X .	-1
I could not stand the smell of this . I threw it out after having it in my car for 5 minutes	-1
The mounting brackets for these lights SUCK . The lights are pretty bright but I have no use for it since I ca n't mount it nicely .	-1
First thing I tested was how bright it was next to a `` 55 Watt regular halogen headlight '' . This LED was not even close . Im guessing It might be half as bright.Problem : I measured the Voltage and current at three voltage levels . First 12.05V @ 1.34A that comes out to 16.147 Watts . Next 12.92V @ 1.24A is 16.021 Watts . Finally 22.6V 0.72A is 16.272 Watts . The Voltages and Currents were measured at the same time for accuracy . The built in DC-DC converter is probably about 90 % efficient . At 90 % the LEDs are only getting about 14.645 Watts . When I compared each LED in the bar by shining it 3 inches from several surfaces , the 2 on the left are dimmer than the others . The far left LED is the dimmest.Some companies will run there LED 's a little lower Voltage to prevent burnout and increase life but this means they are not as bright as they should be.Also the light was mostly white but had yellow areas in the spot . The lense was scratched and there was glue on the lense and housing . Mine may have been a refurbished model .	-1
I could not get a pair that matched or did not have some sort of quality issue I could not accept . First pair had one light that had the plastic wrap glued to the lens . ( They are glued in ) I returned one and ordered another . The replacement had a different fin count on the housing and did not match the one I kept . Returned both then placed an order for another pair . Received the second pair and inspected . The first one was perfect . The only one with a lens that was fully seated . Opened the second one only to find the lens at least 1/4 inch from seated in the housing . Just returned both . I 'll try another style.I will admit the one I tested put out a strong beam and the price is cheap but the quality was too cheap for me to keep . I will agree with other reviews about the crappy bracket . The provided screws bottom out on the light housing before clamping the bracket to the housing . Also other reviews have mentioned about moisture in the light . I could definitely see this with the crappy way the lens is glued into the housing . This could be cured by adding sealer around the edge . Maybe super glue since that is what the mfg appears to use .	-1
I have an older Chevy Tahoe that is a work truck . It has developed a slightly rough idle and I had hoped this Royal Purple Max-Clean would help smooth it out . It had a tuneup not long ago with new spark plugs , rotor , wires , etc and that did n't make much difference either so I have to assume maybe dirty or sticky injectors . I expected some difference based on the claims made for this Royal Purple fuel system cleaner but It made no difference at all . I can not detect any difference in how the truck idles or runs . I think I wasted my money . Maybe it works for certain other problems and might work for you but it is costly and no refunds if it does n't work either .	-1
I love royal purple - but no difference - wish Castrol GTX still made theres , that was a difference !	-1
First , let me start off by stating that this is an un-bias review , I purchased this product from amazon , unlike many of the Amazon Vine product reviewers.Being an automotive technician with an engineering background , I can not for the life of me recommend this product to the general consumer . Make no mistake , as others have claimed , the build quality of this Item is great , but aside from the rest of the reviews , there is one aspect I have n't seen covered that MUST be addressed : The output voltage is way too high for any automotive installation application . after installing the solar array , I decided to take some readings to see what kind of output I was receiving , before finishing the install.First sunny day of April , 74degrees , and located in TN : Voltage : 24.2v in direct sunlightAmpere : 0.3Most 12v systems recharge at a voltage range between 13.2-14.7v via the alternator , or battery charger , Hooking this device in with a 24v output ( even at low amps ) can cause the battery to over-charge , the ecu to throw an over-voltage check engine code , or even worse , fry the ECU.devices such as lawn mowers , trolling motors , four wheelers , tractors , etc , that may not use or monitor battery voltage may be better suited for use with this , although I would not recommend charging even those batteries at such a high voltage .	-1
I chose these sprayers for their chemical resistance . I used this acid wheel cleaner in it , which works very well for cleaning wheels . Since it 's slightly acidic , I wanted a robust sprayer . This sprayer worked the first time , but when I tried to use it a week later , it was completely clogged . What a piece of crap for this price point .	-1
I purchased this for a cleanout plug at our local restaurant . It was a simple PVC plug with a recessed fitting . I thought this tool would be great since we could n't get it open ... I was wrong . First , due to the fact that it was literally in the floor the tool needed to be manipulated and reshaped . I did this by bending the plastic after heating it up first with a heat gun . I allowed the plastic to cool for about 15 minutes assuring it would n't be soft . Now that it had the right shape I inserted the end into the recessed fitting in the plug only to find that neither side was a great fit . One end was way too large , the next was about right but due to rounded corners made the product slide out and essentially warp/strip the fitting.I believe at least one , if not both of the other reviews as of April 24th are BS reviews ... I tried this on simple PVC , I could n't imagine this thing opening a brass plug that has any tightness and perhaps even seizure to it . I finally wound up getting it open since it was PVC by taking my 20.00 heat gun to it , softening the plug at the threads and prying it out with a flathead . Which was so quick and easy I wish I did this in the first place !	-1
Does n't do what it promises . That sums it up . This is n't a cheap piece of electronics . I purchased this for ONE reason , which was CLAIMED by Superchips . The ability to turn off the TPMS . This piece of junk does n't do that . Does it eliminate one electronic & # 34 ; ping & # 34 ; - yes . Was that worth $ 150 ? Hell no.They claimed they & # 34 ; were working on it & # 34 ; and it would be fixed . They have n't done so . If your jeep will still throw up the tire light - it does n't solve the TPMS issue . I do n't care about eliminating a single & # 34 ; ping & # 34 ; to the tune of $ 150.This was the worst purchase I have EVER made for my JK . Because it & # 34 ; locks & # 34 ; to your specific JK it is n't returnable to any store . Superchips should be ashamed they put this piece of trash out to market with the marketing they did . I am sure it does some things well - but if you are ADVERTISING a function that it does n't have that is a SERIOUS PROBLEM .	-1
The trick to getting it to adhere and protect is indeed to spray it thicker than you think . However-when they say it & # 34 ; lasts about one year & # 34 ; , they mean it slowly degrades over time and looks like paint is peeling off .	-1
While I was looking for more Griot 's Garage microfiber towels , I happen across these & I thought I 'd give them try.The pros : + $ 13.61 with free shipping when I bought mine.+ Pretty good customer product reviews.+ Advertized as `` extra thick '' .The cons : - Tags that need to be cutoff.- The `` silk banded edges '' are overly thick . I prefer a thinner , hemmed edge.- Not as thick & fluffy as I expected . In addition , these are fluffy on only `` ONE '' side ? This was a surprise ! Closing thoughts:6 of these cost less than 3 Griot 's Garage microfiber towels . Having used Griot 's Garage microfiber towels for years , they 're better & as the old saying goes ... `` you get what you pay for ! `` I 'm not sure I 'm even going to use these . I think they 're headed to the donation box ...	-1
These caps are designed for both 4 & # 34 ; and 4.5 & # 34 ; bumpers . But they are made of hard plastic rather than rubber like the others . There are 3 fingers that are supposed to grip the sides of the bumper , but it is just too tight for 4 & # 34 ; bumpers . It would probably work OK for a 4.5 & # 34 ; bumper , but they need to make a version specifically for 4 & # 34 ; bumpers.This is unfortunate as Camco makes some neat and unique stuff for the RV'er , but this product could use a bit of refinement .	-1
I just purchased this kit . I went against my better judgement and didnt go with Kensun this time . BAD MISTAKE . The kit arrived and was packaged very nicely . It seemed like it was gon na be a great quality product . I prepared the vehicle for installation and when i went to plug the bulbs into the ballast harness , one of the wires just slid out of the connector . Poor connection . Figured no big deal , ill just try the other bulb in the ballast that was plugged in ... Went to connect it , and then another wire came apart ... Just tragic quality ... Go figure , China ... But this time its a garbage product from China . I have had great luck with Kensun . Their products are also Chinese , but HIGH QUALITY . Steer clear of this product ! ! ! Look at and buy KENSUN products .	-1
My husband recently remodeled and painted a Mercedes Benz E320 for my winter vehicle . Since we live in Western New York where the winters are brutal . I thought this product would be helpful in keeping my newly painted hood in pristine condition . We followed the directions as directed and watched several videos over and over again because I did not want to make any mistakes . After the hood was pelted with snow , sleet and salt from the roads my hood looked cloudy and it looked like it had cracks . I was extremely disappointed . I was so upset because it worried me if my hood would even come back to its original condition before the 3M Paint Defender was applied.To remove this stuff was not an easy task . My husband ended up wet sanding the hood and then buffing it back to a high shine . I will never consider using this again . I might think about the `` clear bra film '' option , which is done by professionals and is said to last 5 to 7ears . The clear bra is more of a `` saranwrap '' fitted hard film instead of spraying on a finish on your car . Leave something like this to professionals who have experience in the field and know which brands and products are worth investing in .	-1
Let me make one thing perfectly clear . I have a very nice shiny black luxury car . I thought I 'd check this system out to see if it would help me keep my car shiny and protect the finish . The simple answer is - yes it will protect it but you wo n't like the way it looks . I tested this on a small part of my car 's hood first and it was difficult to spray without dimpling . Then , once the finish is on , it makes my shiny black car look like it is covered with gray film - not at all what I wanted . I think this may just be a problem with shiny jet black cars and may be less visible on other colors . I think it would protect the underlying finish but you just may not like the way it looks .	-1
I do n't care how good you are if you are any sort of snob about things looking proper and or being done correctly , this product is not for you.I am one of those that usually here someone say something does n't work and think well they probably did it wrong or in a rush . This is not one of those times.I have a hunch this might work MUCH MUCH better on maybe a white car , but dark colors are definitely out of the question in my book . That is one of the reasons I think there is a variance on people that like it and people that do n't . Another thing I think that I think is affecting the reviews are the age of the paint job its being applied too . I am positive most are skipping having a truly clean and properly waxed car when applying this.Lucky for me I did not apply this to my own vehicle or I would not have been happy . I have tried applying this to a hood that is stored in our garage because of what I read from other people . Its a deeper red color . This stuff never really disappeared . I could see it on there . Trying to clean it off was even worse . I stopped trying . Though I do n't think that is a bad thing , it is meant to stay on there I guess . Problem is if you no longer want it on there it will be a hassle.I really ca n't recommend this stuff . I do think it might work better on car colors that typically do n't show a lot of dirt like white or silver . If your a perfectionist or have issue with the little things , this is really not for you .	-1
The prep process for this product requires a lot of attention and focus . I had the impression that this stuff would be pretty straightforward to apply , and I suppose it is , but it takes more work than I anticipated.The results did n't really match my expectations either , unfortunately . The product is n't quite as clear as advertised and is n't as durable either.Look , perhaps under perfect conditions you can get the results they promise . My real world experience was different .	-1
I was really looking forward to putting this on my truck . You have to apply it in 'warmer ' weather ( 65+ if I recall ) so make sure to plan accordingly.In the end , there 's a LOT to do to try to get this right . I did n't get it 'right ' the first time , but was able to reset . Likewise , a kit does n't cover much . It 's basically good for a front bra , but you 'd need quite a few to , say , cover the hood.There 's also a ton of prep work , but that 's kind of to be expected.I probably wo n't use this again . It does work , but it 's such a pain that I 'd rather just take it to a shop , pay a bit more to have someone else do it , and have a bit more confidence in the application.I received this from the manufacturer for testing and review and have shared my honest experience in this review .	-1
This stuff is difficult to apply , near impossible to remove and does n't leave a good finish . Stick with regular wax . You 'll get a better , longer lasting finish with much less work .	-1
I applied this with the help of a mechanic in his shop to my fairly new Mercedes . I was hoping it would work wonders since I put on tons of miles in Florida . It looked terrible . There are better options out there and I will not be applying this to my other vehicles . Too much time is involved and the results are not impressive .	-1
After reading the reviews I decided to try this out on a painted ( powder coat ) basketball pole following all the directions exactly as recommended . It looked terrible and like everyone else is reporting , it will not come off . I 'm very happy I did not put this on my car . Do n't do it , folks . And do n't come back here to complain if you do . You 've been warned .	-1
I 'm a car buff and do most of my own mechanical work and all my own detailing . We have a fairly new Accord , ( 1 year old ) that I thought it might be nice to protect the front bumper on . I 'm familiar with the 3M clear bra system from professionals and it is very , very good but expensive . So here comes what I think is the same product in a DIY format.First , you need to really prepare the surface for this product . Not just wash the car but wash , clay , machine clean , polish ( but NOT wax ) and make sure it is absolutely baby butt smooth and that there is no dirt or debris residing on the surface . However , even after doing all this , I still had dust on the surface by time I masked off the rest of the front end . So my first attempt was way less then perfect so I thought I 'll just peel it off and try again - wrong ! The easy peel nature of this product is a fiction - it 's a mess to remove and will try your patience.I threw the rest of the product away and figured if I really wanted the protection , I 'd go to the professionals and pay $ 300 for a 3M clear bra treatment which I understand is very , very good and very durable . Some things are just better left to the professionals and this falls squarely into that category for me .	-1
Absorbs great , but does not leave car spot free . I will use this until i find something a lot better.12-24-2013 : It 's been about two and a half months now , and this product absorbs worse than a Kleenex . I wipe , wring it out , wipe , repeat , and it looks as if it just rained on my car . I 've always used leather chamois in the past with no issues , and now I am suffering from buyer 's remorse .	-1
This product is n't much better than a bucket of water . If you car is relatively & # 34 ; clean & # 34 ; before you use this product then I can maybe see using it . For any amount of dirt on the car beyond that it 's not worth using because the water gets dirty too fast and begins to eliminate the ability to take more dirt off the car . You end up moving dirt around on the car with a dirty cloth and dirty water . Think micro scratches on your clear coat if you have a newer car .	-1
What else can I say ? It is DOA . Tried with GPS , tried with Phone , tried different cables and did n't work .	-1
Maybe I 'm a perfectionist ( no I 'm reslly not ) or I 'm just a klutz ( a real possibility ) but I have never been able to get good results with anything that was supposed to keep my work area clean . This sanding kit is no exception . I had a nice little job lined up for it - pulling out , filling and sanding the dent that I put in the rear of my Honda CRV . Frankly , I gave up trying to use the kit to smooth out the Bondo and went `` unprotected '' - it was just so much easier and faster that way .	-1
Does it work ? Yes , but does it work well enough to make a huge difference in how you go about a sanding project - no.What you get . A sanding pad to hold specially made disks , a funky looking funnel thing and a length of cheap , light , flexible hose . You are supposed to put these three things together and let me tell you , it is a pain to do . The hose struggles to make a connection with the grip because the plug end is slightly too big and you really have to work to get it on . At the other end , you have a different problem ... the hose is slightly too big to make a secure connection and it easily dislodges . It was like a guy found this stuff lying around and said `` hey - look what I can make out of these three things ! `` .Once you get it together , you can not secure it to the vacuum unless it is already running . Okay - I can live with that but it is still kind of a kludge design . Get it all hooked up and running and the hose shortens right up and loses much of its flexibility.On the working and , it is sucking up dust pretty well , but it is a pain to work with all these limitations in the design . I find myself ditching this contraption and grabbing good old sandpaper.Then when I am done - I have to clean this thing up and find a place to keep it.Bottom line is - I will hold on to this ... for now but I suspect that this will end up in the trash at some point . I certainly would not recommend buying it . It is not worth it .	-1
Have to say I hate the way both of these smell ... The new car smells like burned electronics and makes me feel sick ... The leather , well it is leather like ... but more like old worn slightly moldy smelling leather..In fact it does smell very much like a pair of 20 year old boots I have that has been half-soled countless times ... It 's a comforting smell in an old boot.. not so much the car ...	-1
This Automatic outfit suks big time . I went to the Jeep dealer to get the link plugged in just to make sure everything was right . On the side of the box containing the link is a statement `` Download the free Automatic app to get started '' . I went to automatic.com/apps web site and nowhere could I find a download command for any app . I kept getting shuffled back and forth to Apple but could not find an app there either . They have an alleged capability to ask a question . That got me another serious runaround and no answer . This web site must have been designed and built by a Chimp . This whole operation is the most amateurish I have ever seen . I called in some neighbors to see if they could make some sense of this but to no avail . I will readily admit that I may be overlooking the obvious but I am not the only one . If anyone knows how to get this link thingy to work please fill me in . Do I need to d/l an app or not ? If yes , then how ? The way it is now it is not working and I see no connection to my iPhone..	-1
Automatic is the `` Smart Driving Assistant '' that is supposed to help you be a more efficient driver by monitoring your driving quality and telling you how to improve . In short , this is the most expensive ODB II code reader you will find that has such a limited set of features . I understand what they are trying to do ( keep it simple ) , and overall , it does work as advertised . I was hoping there was more `` under the hood '' and discovered that it is really quite limited.In the box , you get the white Automatic ODB II code reader dongle . If you 've never seen this connector , it is likely under the dashboard of your car . There is n't much else in the box other than a nice little `` A '' sticker you can put on your window to let everyone know you 've got the cool new Automatic in your car . You will also need the iPhone app called `` Automatic '' and an iPhone 4S or later . The reason this wo n't work on an iPhone 4 or earlier is because it uses low-power Bluetooth , a protocol not supported on the earlier iPhones . Unlike a bluetooth headset , you do n't need to pair this with your iPhone . With the new protocol , it just works.I installed the Automatic app on my iPhone 5S . First , it was a little disappointing that it requires me to give my name , e-mail address , and create an account/login to their site to use the app . There goes privacy right there . Why ca n't it just tell me how I am driving without requiring me to be registered on their site ? When I first plugged Automatic into my car , I got a nice beep from the device itself to let me know it was plugged in . The Automatic app on my iPhone ( now that I was registered ) failed to find the device . I tried to plug and unplug a few times , but eventually I force-closed the app ( double click the home button on the iPhone and throw away the app ) , and re-launched it . On re-launch , it found my dongle.Once in the app , it is fairly simple . When you drive your car , it will alert you if you do one of three bad things - hit the brakes hard , drive over 70 , or have a hard acceleration . If that happens , a small sound will play and your `` driver score '' will get dinged . When you stop the car , it will record your distance , MPG , and a rough estimate of the cost of that trip based on current gas prices . It also will maintain a cumulative driver score . The nice part about the app is that it essentially provides you a log of your drives while it runs in the background of the iPhone , so you can look back on your driving history.There is also an engine status page where you can see the status of the engine and read any codes that may be thrown . If your car has a check engine light , it can advise you what is wrong . A problem with the vapor recovery system might require tightening the gas cap . Yes , this can save you a trip to the mechanic , but I 'm not sure how many other codes are that simple.So why only 3 stars ? First , I was hoping that the driving statistics would be more meaningful . How about a graph of my acceleration over the trip , car efficiency , oxygen sensors , etc ? In fact , none of the internal sensors are brought out so I can view them , much less logged over time . All of this data is aggregated into my driver score . I can buy a reader for my car that costs less than this and will link with my laptop to provide live car readouts . I get that this is n't their target market , but they are charging a lot more for this than their competition . It 's `` just software '' , so why not provide an `` advanced '' screen with live engine status readouts ? Why not log speed data ? It just does n't do that much.Second , there are plenty of highways where the speed limit is above 70 . Why not let me customize this limit ? This device is not going to be useful in places with higher speed limits.Third , I did n't mention it in my review , but there is a Crash assist feature that I am dubious about . It says it will get me assistance in case of a crash using an accelerometer in the device . Why not use the accelerometer in my car , or use airbag deployment as a proxy ? How do I know if it is tuned right ? Will an accidental kick set it off ? And who monitors the crash system ? My home alarm system is monitored by a UL approved monitoring company . General Motors has OnStar . I have no idea what sort of back-end system Automatic has monitoring crash alerts and what kind of load it can handle . Not to mention - they do n't know my cell phone number . If I am in a crash , how will the police contact me ? How will I let them know it 's a false alarm ? The app and website are really sparse on this data.So conclusion ? In short , it does work . If your check engine light is on , it will tell you the code and let you reset it , but a $ 15 reader will do that . It will alert you if you make 3 driving errors ( accelerate too fast , drive too fast , or brake too suddenly ) , but even then , the `` drive too fast '' wo n't let you customize it for the road.Based on the data they 've given me so far , I have little confidence in Crash Alert ( it even says `` Beta '' ) , and I am sorely disappointed that for $ 100 , I ca n't view engine status , sensors , or anything else in my car . At the very least , allow me to log acceleration data on the drive.3 stars - the hardware seems to work , but the software has a long way to go to justify the price.UPDATE : After using this for 2 weeks , going on a long car trip , and driving through a congested city , I am updating this to 2 stars as I am removing it from my car and putting it away until Automatic releases a serious software update . It is beyond useless . I drove down I-95 to Richmond where the speed limit is 70 . As soon as I hit the speed limit , it started beeping at me - very distracting while driving . As I said before , if you ca n't even drive the speed limit without getting your driver score dinged , what is the point ? I also had a car in front of me stop short . I slammed my brakes and got beeped at again . I do n't know what the folks at Automatic expect me to do when a sudden obstacle is in front of my car , but I fear the beeping alarm could cause me to get startled and have a real accident.My hopes for this device were that it would be like the Prius in terms of driver feedback . I do n't own one , but I 've driven one and noticed the live readout of your MPG . You learn to slowly apply the accelerator and how exactly to drive to maximize fuel economy . It is a live readout of everything . That is what Automatic could have done - live readouts during a drive . Instead , I get a binary decision on 3 factors . Two of those factors can be violated for normal reasons that have nothing to do with bad driving habits , and the distracting alarm could cause a real accident . The only feedback I get during a drive itself is a rotating icon that lets me know a drive is in progress . Seriously ? No other live display ? Meanwhile , by hiding all engine sensor data , there are real things like dirty air filters and low tire pressure that could be reported and could really help fuel economy . But Automatic ignores this data from the car computer.Seriously , I do not recommend this device .	-1
This product does exactly what it says it does . I plugged it into the OBD-II port on my 2004 BMW M3 and it linked up to my iPhone 5 . Took three tries , but it worked.Problem 1 - ( Unavoidable ) - it requires you to leave a doggle plugged into your OBD-II port . My port is just above my clutch pedal and there is a little door that swings down when the doggle is plugged in . This causes my foot to bang into the open OBD-II port door when I use the clutch . This is unacceptable to me . I guess I could rip off the door.Problem 2 - The doggle emits a tone whenever a threshold is reached - either speed , acceleration , or breaking . The tone can not be turned off . It comes from the doggle , not the iphone.Problem 3 - You can not adjust the thresholds . For example , it emits a tone when you exceed 70 mph . This is ridiculous . Everyone drives over 70 mph . Even my 94 year old grandmother . Everyone . The acceleration and breaking tones are similarly set with very low thresholds . The inability to adjust the thresholds ( coupled with the inability to turn off the incessant tones ) will lead me to remove this from my car.Problem 4 - It strives to tell you how much each trip costs you , but does not give you the ability to input the price of gas . This makes the readout completely unreliable.The whole point of this seems to be to prompt your to get better mileage . ( There is also a function to send a text message if you are in a major crash . Presumably that means the airbags deploy . ) It is a giant nag and the inability to customize any of the thresholds makes it pretty useless to me . It was constantly beeping at me . After three days of driving with it , I have learned to simply ignore the tones . That defeats the purpose.UPDATE : After leaving this attached to my car for two days of non-use I have a dead battery . Never had a dead battery before in this car and often leave it for a week or more without use , so I am blaming this device .	-1
I love techno gadgets , but this is a $ 100.00 dollar toy , and nothing more . The features are very limited on the device , and most of them I already have on my car since it only a couple years old . This was fun to play with for one day , but then I was over it . If you 're really a gearhead , you might get a little more entertainment from it , but I doubt it . Save your money .	-1
The Zubie has so much potential . Just think about all the other behaviors that when monitored and tracked , improve results.- Fitness- Diet- Relationships- Programs ... the list goes on . So why would n't you want to know about your car and driving habits ? The unit plugs neatly into the cpu/scanner port in the car . In our Volvo it 's right next to the hood release lever . Installation was literally a snap . It locked on and activated within a short drive around the neighborhood , and immediately began compiling results . I will say that a lot of the results are kind of duplicative of most modern day onboard systems . If your car has a mileage computer and nav , a lof of stuff is being done for you already , although perhaps not displayed in such a neat rolled up dashboard fashion.Should you pay $ 99/year for this ? The only glimmer of a possibility is if you have money to burn and a teenaged driver you want to monitor.Personally I hate modern conveniences that require subscription fees . GPS with realtime traffic ? Locating devices ? What is the value-added here that justifies shelling out a big chunk of change ? Will you save $ 99 in car insurance premiums for becoming safer driver , gas fill ups from driving more efficiently ? ... that 's a leap of faith . When you add in the murky aspect of not knowing what/why/how your personal driving info will be used , it seems to me that this is a bad buy . If it were a one time $ 99 fee , I 'd reconsider ... but annually ? Thanks but no thanks .	-1
I 'm glad I read the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use BEFORE I tried installing this Key and app . First off , updates to the privacy policy are only announced on the Privacy Policy page ( [ ... ] ) , along with the date those changes were made . Zubie does n't send out e-mails if they make the Privacy Policy even more intrusive than it already is .

I have already been testing a similar device , Automatic Link Smart Driving Assistantbut there were some things I did n't care for with that device so when Vine offered me the Zubie , I was definitely interested to try it out . However , at a very expensive $ 99/year subscription price , it 's pretty hard for me to recommend this over the Automatic , which does not come with a similar requirement for use . Other reviewers have talked about the privacy concerns , and it seems that this device really would only be worth considering if you are a parent wishing to track the driving habits of your teenage driver . While this device does have some clear benefits over others , such as tracking your activity even when you do n't have the app running , the cost of enrollment is just WAY too much for what I get with it when there are other similar devices that do n't come with the same requirement .	-1
I 've been with Amazon since they were just selling books and I 've been reading reviews for a very long time . In fact , I 've read enough reviews over the years to become suspicious of the validity of some if warranted . That said , I am highly suspicious of many of the five star ratings this device is receiving and it gives me pause.That said , I received this device not completely knowing what I was getting . There are several devices out there that do the same thing without a subscription ( $ 99 a year ? Are you kidding me ? ) and without the privacy issues this device seems to be famous for . I carefully read all their online documentation . Some folks may care less about privacy and that 's fine . I 'm not overly concerned about it myself but after reading their documentation there 's no way I 'm signing on for this or paying them $ 99 for their service.If you do n't mind them tracking you and storing all your information , and you do n't mind paying them $ 99 a year to do that , and you do n't mind who else receives that information , then go ahead and jump in . I 'm not .	-1
This product smells nothing like & # 34 ; New car & # 34 ; but is not unpleasant . The freshness only lasts a few days . My chief complaint about this is that it is not so much an odor eliminator but more of a sense of smell eliminator.After using the product as directed and getting using the vehicle the next day I noticed that the tip of my tongue was numb and that my sense of smell was diminished while in the car and for a couple of minutes after leaving the car . I cross checked this by blind testing my wife and a friend of mine and they both had the same numbness/deadening on their tongues and reduced sense of smell.I use Meguiars products frequently and love the non-aerosol spray odor eliminator and will continue the use of that product but never again will I use this product .	-1
I 'm a pretty big fan of Meguairs products . I jumped on this one as soon as I saw it available . It 's easy to use and does the job . Problem ? The after smell of the product is less than favorable . It 's VERY strong and while it 's not terrible , it 's far from pleasant . If they got a better fragrance I 'd be willing to try that one . This & # 34 ; new car & # 34 ; smell is far from it and far from good .	-1
OK , what marketing guys dreamed this stuff up ? There are many wheel cleaners on the market , from all the usual suspects . The best manage to remove brake dust and other grunge pretty effectively , with a bit of scrubbing , and do it without harming clear coat and other alloy wheel finishes . The key is to get the job done but do no harm . The best seem to be the cleaners from armor all and , above all else , sonax and p21s.For starters , this Dub stuff smells downright weird , like cheap perfume and tropical fruit cocktails from a 1980s fern bar . Then there is the color gimmick . Whats with that ? I definitely do not want my recently refinished alloys to turn technicolor green and red while Im washing my car . And then the litany of warnings , which all do make me wonder how gentle this stuff will be and what damage it will do if used regularly a couple of times a week.And the results ? On stubbornly grimy wheels , not on par with the top three , named above , not by a long shot.The verdict : one star for creativity - albeit misguided . Another star for results . I know of no good reason to buy this product beyond curiosity about a multicolored pina colada scented wheel cleaner . What the heck ?	-1
This has a terrible smell that really lingers awhile . It goes on green and turns rust red after about 5 minutes . Then you wash it all off . It worked well on my wheels to remove the surface dirt and brake dust without scrubbing - but I would have gotten the same effect with a light scrubbing with a wheel brush . It did nothing to remove small bits of road tar - but they came off easily with a light brushing . No damage , but not really worth the effort .	-1
WARNING AGAIN ... .BURGUNDY COLOR RUNS ... WASH OUT BY HAND AS IT WILL TAKE MANY , MANY WASHES TO GET THE RED OUT ! NOT WORTH IT ! ! Have been a big fan of Zwipes for some time.Am on my second bulk package of Zwipes regular microfiber cloths in pastel colors . Purchased them at Amazon ... 48 Zwipes for under $ 23 ! Price and color wise this is the way to go.These burgundy waffle weave Zwipes are targeted for stemware . They did a fine job on glassware , mirrors and computer screens in our home.I also find the regular Zwipe to be just as effective , especially when new.When I purchase any Zwipes , I designate half the colors for water and windex cleaning , and the other half for polishing with waxes etc.Machine wash with no fabric softener and you are cleaning well and saving the environment .	-1
Knowing that red items might bleed , I decided to put the towels in a sink-full of water to see what happened . Oh , my gosh , these towels faded badly . I left them soak a while , wrung them out , added more hot water & let them soak again ... they faded more . I repeated this process one more time , then wrung the towels out & let them dry . I decided to handwash a couple of them , so I soaped them up & ran hot water on them . I could n't believe that the water was even redder than before . I 'm wondering if they 'll ever stop fading.The two I handwashed were used for general house cleaning . They did a good job dusting , absorbing water & keeping surfaces lint free . I will dedicate some for glassware use but might bleach them to hopefully stop the color bleed.Because of their waffle weave texture , the towels measure about 1/2 '' shorter all the way around than advertised . They can be stretched to the advertised size.Zwipes Waffle Weave towels perform like microfiber should , but I can not recommend the burgundy color .	-1
Most basically , these are microfiber towels , so there 's no much to say . They are small , thing , absorb liquid , etc . I did n't find any features that make them particularly notable . The price is okay for a six pack , but the frayed edges let you know that these are fairly cheaply manufactured.I use these for drying , so it 's not like the color rubs off ; however , if you soak these , they will bleed into the water . It 's best to wash these in the sink if you do n't want your laundry to end up vaguely burgundy colored.These towels are fine , but not great . The fact that I have to wash them separately is supremely annoying . I 'd look elsewhere if you 're in the market for a microfiber towel .	-1
This Zwipes set comes with very nice squeegee-style blade as well as a single hand towel . The blade does a great job of getting most of the water off of my car . It is soft enough that I do n't worry about damage to my paint . It removes water in streak-free fashion and then you 're ready to finish up with the towel.The towel is n't so stellar . It did n't seem to hold much water , and , more importantly , it left blue fuzz on my car . Small pills of fuzz appeared after every few wipes . When I got done , my clean car was dotted with little blue pieces of the towel . I guess I 'll have to get out the blower and blow them away.While I give thumbs up to the squeegee , any towel that leaves a mess on my car is n't something I 'd buy again .	-1
very thin material . not very warm at all.. barley breaks the wind and on a cold day is pretty much useless.. not for winter sports	-1
OK , I have to admit , the price of this item did not have my expectations unfairly high . It is a straight tube neck/face cover with a whimsical lower skull image on both front and back . Material is stretchy and easily pulls up over the face . However the material does not & # 34 ; breath & # 34 ; very well and condensation from your breath builds up moisture on your face and will steam up glasses if you wear them ( even sunglasses and open goggles ) . There is no hem around either end of the tube ( guess a strecthy thread was not considered ) and the material has started to fray a bit . For the price , this is a cute novelty item , but not what I really need it for . I have spent a few more bucks on a better quality one and awaiting that one to see if it works better with the condensation issue . As for THIS seller ; be aware that this is an INTERNATIONAL ORDER ( China I suspect ) although it is not listed in the posting . This equated to a very delayed delivery date ( exceeded the estimated delivery date considerably ) . If you want a & # 34 ; novelty & # 34 ; item that you are n't going to wear long , this one is OK . If you want one you can wear for wind and cold protection without a lot of condensation building up on your face , spend a few bucks for a better one .	-1
