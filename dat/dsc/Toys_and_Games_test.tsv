This is really a cute toy ! A big pink elephant with 75+ sound effects , tunes , and activities will certainly keep a little one ( 6-36 months ) engaged . When the child lifts the large ear , a letter is revealed . Then a matching light up scrolling image represents the letter . A pull down mouse teaches shapes and colors ; a toggle switch advances letters forward or backward , a pull down trunk proclaims a new word . All with appropriate sound effects . There is a silent sliding number indicator on top . All this activity in durable , sturdy plastic . This toy is a delight !	1
Daughter 's 2nd birthday present . She likes to press the button and pull the trunk . My older girls like to play around with it too . I think this toy is better for a 3 year old who can pay better attention to all the things you can learn with the pictures . My daughter pretty much just likes to watch the pictures move and press the buttons but I think it is a fun toy and I would recommend it .	1
What a cute , fun toy ! My 2-year-old was very excited to see an elephant and starting pushing/pulling/sliding everything he could on the toy . He repeats what videos/toys say as he is learning , so he repeats everything it says . He really enjoys scrolling through all the different pictures.Even my 10-month-old twins have fun with the toy . They love watching it light up and being able to push buttons or pull on things or making it play music.A cute & fun toy that is very entertaining for little ones .	1
This is basically a busy box with a language spin , instead of just movement and noises . It is also attractive , intuitive , and engaging from the initial busy box age through language development and alphabet , colors , etc . It truly does seem appropriate for babies and on up to about 3 years , so it would make a great shower gift . Its play value will last a long time . The sound is not too loud , and it is sturdy enough to not be a broken disappointment .	1
I originally selected this toy with my 1 year old in mind . She likes the bright pink color and the light up & # 34 ; screen & # 34 ; where the letters scroll by . However , my 2 ( almost 3 ) year old twins are the ones who have really given this toy the play time . One of my twins , due to hearing issues , has limited speech . However , he does try to say the letters as the elephant says them . My one year old loves the & # 34 ; busy box & # 34 ; aspect of it and is always trying to see what she can make it do next . Although my one year old has n't quite mastered & # 34 ; pulling the trunk & # 34 ; that is the favorite feature of my two year olds . I think this toy will be seeing a lot of use over the next few months .	1
My son is trying to learn his ABC 's and this is one of the tools we use to make it fun . He likes the elephant and it shows the letter while showing pictures of things that start with the same letter . There are different pictures for the same letter which I really like . It 's easy to use and easy to clean as well . The sounds are fun for kids and it 's a great adjunct to what you are doing already to help your child learn ABC 's . Generally , it is not riveting enough that it will be the sole way ( My guess ) your child learns their ABC 's or does it keep my child 's attention for more than 5 minutes at a time . There are tons of products out there , but this one is as fun and useful as any , if not more-so . Good solid price point makes this a great gift for the young one ready to learn !	1
I 'll start with the best part . The Gorzan minifig . It 's simply Awesome ! The detailings and printings on the minifig are great . `` Legends of Chima '' has become my favourite LEGO theme primarily because of the beautiful minifigs ( and I like the concept of half animal-half human ! ) . The minifig comes with two weapons . One weapon is an assembled-one . I generally hate the assembled weapons from LEGO . ( Do n't look good , is what I feel ) . But the one in this set is okay.This set also contains some very nice pieces . Like the banana , which I think is one of the best LEGO-pieces . ( you get two banana pieces in this set ) . And the wine-piece is also cool . I have n't seen this piece in any other LEGO theme before . Could be a new one . In the `` Chima '' theme , LEGO has come out with many brand new pieces.I have NEVER liked speedors from the start . They do n't move smoothly . They wobble while moving . Sometimes the attachment that you fix at the back of the speedor helps in giving some stability to it . But not always . I feel there 's a major design flaw in the speedor . Apart from giving one big wheel in the front , LEGO should have provided two small ones at the back . Then the speedor would have moved very nicely . Currently , the ONLY reason that people buy speedor is because of the minifig . And THAT is the only reason I bought this set . In fact I have TWO of this set . That 's because I LOVE the Gorzan minifig . And I will still buy more of this set in the future . I am building a small gorilla-army ! & # 61514 ; Kids are gon na like this set because of the minifig and hey kids will mostly like the speedor ( Kids will enjoy any toy even if it has faults..they are kids after all ! ! ) . For adults who like collecting minfigs , they HAVE to buy this ..for Gorzan !	1
If your child is into Lego Chima , chances are good that he/she will really like this . Mine wanted it for specific parts because they like to build other things ( out of their imaginations ) using various parts from other sets they have already .	1
This was bought for a 7 year old and it was a big hit , so I would certainly recommend this toy and I would buy from this seller again .	1
Went together nicely , good price , Its a hit for my 6 year old son . Now he has gorillas in his Chima collection !	1
I got this using a $ 25.00 amazon gift card i recieved for christmas . This is an interesting , fun , and creative set . I like these chima gorillas and the vine pieces you get . This Lego chima speedor set came today , the 30th of December ( exactly when the estimation date was expected ! ) I also love these chima lego gorilla minifigures . I suggest getting these lego chima speedors .	1
They glow bright . My kids love wearing them at night and in a dark room . Great for all the bracelets and necklaces they make . Will order more for sure .	1
It would have ordinarily seemed strange that I had to research rubber bands before buying a bunch of different sets , including this one , for our children . But since rainbow loom is the rage these days , I had to make sure I ordered sets that my boys would be happy with ! That being said , I wanted sets that were n't overpriced ( I saw other listings for $ 20 for 300 rubber bands ! ) , came with sufficient supply of S or C clips , and were shipped by Amazon so that I could get Prime shipping . This set met all criteria . The boys are happy campers having received the rubber bands in 2 days ! These bands have the additional benefit of being glow in the dark . The glow is really really faint and you have to look closely even in the dark to see the glow , but kids love these.If you are buying several sets of rubber bands in different colors , I highly recommend an organizer . I boughtArtBin 6-Compartment Tarnish Inhibitor Medium Box , Translucent Clearand it is a great way to keep all the rubber bands organized and , more importantly , avoid rubber bands from being scattered all over the house ! Comment	1
These bands were a great addition to my daughter 's collection . They do exactly what they said they 'd do and glow great . It is n't just a faint glow either ! It is very strong . My daughter swears it helps to hold them up to the light to `` power them up '' too . I 'm not sure if this is really true , but she says it is . The bands are a great quality too . Overall I would recommend these particular bands . We had no issues with them .	1
My son loves this color for making some bracelets . Other kids think its neat because it looks just like white until it gets dark then it surprises everyone !	1
These are great bands , and they really DO glow in the dark ! Fun for the bracelets and necklaces my kids make ! This is a fun feature for them .	1
My daughter really liked the glow in the dark bands . She uses them to mix in with the normal bands to make something different .	1
As you likely know Twistz Bandz aka Rainbow Loom is a way of turning brightly colored rubber bands into bracelets and such that the younger set are wearing now-a-days . These are fun to make ( My SO does this ) and fun for the kids to wear . These are the GitD aka Glow version , which should become very popular.Keep out of reach of very small children or pets . Esp pets as they will chew and swallow them , leading to either vet bills or interesting fewmets .	1
Full disclaimer : I do n't understand Power Rangers and why they are so darn cool . But they are , to my kid.This sword makes cool sounds , and has a spinning Zord head on one end . The other end is a soft-tipped sword.Likes : - The noises are not too loud or obnoxious . Has not driven me mad yet.- My kid simply loves it . Period.- It takes power rangers cards , which you can put in a holder , and it makes new sounds.- Size . Not too big , not too small.Dislikes : - None really . I personally think it is a bit silly , but my child loves it to death . So 5 stars .	1
This Power Rangers Ultra Dragon sword is the American version of the Gosei Tensword that 's from the show , with the main differences being the dragon 's head at the base of the sword ( instead of a ball design ) and the size and color of the blade.The Dragon Sword makes a couple sounds when you press the activation button , and you can make the dragon 's head spin around and his eyes light up green . The eyes are the only thing that does light up on this sword.This Ultra Dragon Sword comes with a Red Ultra Mega Fore Ranger Power Card . If you have/buy thePower Rangers Megaforce Deluxe Gosei Morpher , the card that comes with this sword slides into it . You can then attach the Gosei Morpher to this Dragon Sword and you get access to different sounds the sword can make . However you do n't need to have the Gosei Morpher to play with the Dragon Sword.The Megaforce Ultra Dragon Sword is a fun toy for kids or a nice collectors piece for Power Ranger fans .	1
My kids like anything Power Rangers , so there was no surprise they would like this Power Rangers Sword . This sword only says probably three things over and over , which to an adult may get old pretty quickly but kids apparently do n't mind too much ( at least mine do n't ) . There are two trigger on the handle that makes the bottom part spin and makes sounds . The package comes with a card that you can slide into a slot near the handle of the sword . It seems that when you have the card in , the sounds that come out of the sword when you press the trigger are different .	1
This sword would be well suited for the young Power Rangers fan . Our kids have played with similar toys for years and a lot of the time one of them will get hurt by it while they are playing . Then they will get into an argument about it . This sword has a soft rubber blade on one end which could n't really hurt you . On the other end there is a dragon head with a soft rubber part sticking out further than the nose of the dragon . Yes kids will find a way to get hurt on anything but there is a lot less chance of getting hurt with this sword when compared to many other swords . You can spin the dragon head and it lights up and makes noises . The sword is really loud so the young ones will probably love it but it will likely annoy the parents in time . It makes the same couple sounds over and over again . It feels well balanced when you hold it and it should be pretty durable as well .	1
I grew up watching Power Rangers and I loved it . This is an awesome Dragon Sword and any Power Ranger fan will love it . You hit the button on the sword and the zord spins , and has lights and sounds . This is the 20th anniversary of the Power Rangers in America , which is incredible . This toy is more for kids around 5 years and older . It is light and feels pretty durable . There is not a lot of detail on the sword , but it is made for kids after all . I admit though , this one is for me . : - )	1
The Power Rangers Deluxe Ultra Dragon Sword is an ultra-awesome role-playing toy for the real Power Rangers fan . There are two different modes that are activated by trigger-like buttons . One is the Standard Mode and the other is the Ultra . If you hold down either one of the buttons for a few seconds you 'll hear the Megaforce theme song . `` Me ! -Ga ! -Force ! Power Rangers Megaforce ! `` When you press the button for the Ultra Mode , the Dragon Head ( Zord ) will spin around and it 's eyes will light up . Swish , swish ! You 'll also hear those sword sounds . When you are in the Standard Mode the Dragon Head ( Zord ) will not move , but it 's eyes will light up and you 'll hear other sounds.ThePower Rangers Megaforce Deluxe Gosei Morpher , that will give you more sounds is sold separately . A Power Ranger 's card is included that will slip into the slot to enable sound if you do n't have the Morpher . The sword is not an exact replica of the one in the show , but is still one that is definitely Power Rangers hot.POWER RANGERS TOYS AND ACCESSORIES : Power Ranger Training Set , Red Ranger SetPower Rangers Deluxe Megazord Samurai GigazordPower Rangers Megaforce Gosei Great MegazordPower Rangers Super Samurai , Black Box MorpherPower Rangers Megaforce Deluxe Gosei MorpherPower Ranger Samurai Megazord Action FigurePower Ranger Samurai Samurai Ranger Training GearPower Rangers Megaforce Sky Brothers Zord Vehicle and Red RangerPower Ranger Samurai ClawZord Action Figure	1
It makes noise , it 's Power Rangers and my boys love it . At the touch of a button the Dragon Sword makes battles sounds etc , then another button causes the head to spin . Not heavy but still a good size . Only negative is that the Deluxe Gosei Morpher is not included - has to be purchased separately .	1
This is a great weapon for little kids to play around with ! Part of the blade is rubber so when you get stabbed , it does n't hurt . I am also happy that it makes sounds whenever you spin it , or push the button on the part closest to the blade . If you hold the button closest to the blade and then spin the head , it will play a different song . I sometimes wish that the handle is smaller so you can use it with only one hand while on the other hand , you can hold a shield or some other weapon . They also sell a shield that slides onto the back of where the sound comes out . That could be both good or bad . I would recommend this to someone who has a child that is into Power Rangers and does n't want anyone to be hurt .	1
I ordered this for my son ; this item was exactly what I was expecting and he loved it ; thank you !	1
Loved by the kids -- makes this grandma nervous.At least for grandma 's house this is an & # 34 ; outside / deck & # 34 ; toy.But while it makes me nervous the kids absolutely LOVE it.transforms any little child ( and even a grandpa ) into a Power Ranger .	1
Now this is total awesome and brings about big smiles and a look of what can I get with that from an 8 year old boy . My grandson 's face lit up like a Christmas tree with this one . Perfect size for him too as he 's a bit smaller than most 8 year olds but it would work even for up to age 10 I would say . It 's a noise maker that 's for sure and will give your child plenty of hours of real mind focusing entertainment as they try and think up imaginary foes to use it on . That in itself should give it extra stars since they have to actually think instead of sitting in front of a game playing out what someone else already thought up . This would be a great under the tree attraction getter on Christmas morning that 's for sure .	1
This is a nice , sturdy sword that has some neat features : it lights up , makes sounds , and has a section that spins.We are n't huge Power Ranger fans - I mean , we like them , but do n't watch the show regularly , but every time my son saw this sword , he BEGGED for it . And I see why - it is neat and fun to play with . I 've got 2 young boys , and we have a slew of light sabers , nerf guns , pirate sword and so much more - so this is a GREAT addition to our toy chest , especially as it is somewhat interactive . Both boys now have light-up and noise-making swords , so they are happy : )	1
My youngest son , an active four year old , loves Power Rangers . He likes to imitate the Ninja moves and the other various actions the characters do on the show . As an aside this also entertains my wife and I , as at his age , he looks more like the losing contestant from a Polka Party dance-off than a Ninja . : - ) So when I saw this sword , the Power Rangers Deluxe Ultra Dragon Sword , I knew I had to order it for my son.The sword is a little over two feet long by about six inches wide . On one end is a blade , while the other head has a dragon head . The grip for your child is in roughly the middle of the sword , and it has two buttons , one at each end of the grip . One button causes the sword to light up a bit and make sounds ( including playing the Megaforce Power Ranger theme song ) , while the other button you squeeze down to make the dragon head at the bottom of the sword spin . There is also a place on the outside of the grip where you can insert Power Cards , just like in the TV show . The sword is made of a hard plastic , except for the tip of the sword and parts of the dragon 's head , which are soft , pliable plastic ( which helps prevent injuries during play ) .My boy was extremely excited when I gave him the sword , and loves to play with it . The sword itself is modeled off of the ultra dragon sword from one of the episodes in the series , and he now loves to watch that one over and over while he plays with the sword . We 've had the sword for a few weeks now , and he has n't gotten tired of it . I suspect the length of time your child plays with this sword is dependent on how much he 's `` into '' Power Rangers , but I suspect my little guy will be playing with this sword for weeks to come.Overall , this is a good choice for a young power ranger fan . It has a few bells and whistles that help make it fun to play with . While you should always supervise your children when playing with toys like this , it has some safety features that helps prevent your child from easily skewering their siblings . Five stars .	1
I purchased these to go in my daughter 's goodie bags for her birthday . I was amazed how many tattoos came for such a reasonable amount . They came in one big stack in a little baggie , but did have instructions printed on the back of each one so they could be divided up amongst all the kids.The tattoos are good sized , some bigger than a 3-year old 's hand . They were really easy to use , and applied with a wet napkin after ten seconds . The colors were bright , and the tattoos lasted for at least two days . The girls all loved them , and with so many varieties each child was able to pick their favorite . We 'd definitely order these again !	1
I got this for a cousin who had a slumber party coming up and she informed me that her and her friends had a blast with them ! Everyone seems to like temporary tattoos and these were easy for them to get on and the bright colors and fun designs were a big hit . She still has a bunch left over for next time too !	1
I bought a bunch of different packages , but I like these the best . The colors are very vivid and cute and all the girls like them . 144 is actually a ton of tattoos ! I have used them for rewards/incentives for my daughter , party activities , b-day present extras , giving them out in school on carnival day , etc . - they just come in handy . And I still have most of them left . Best part is they take up almost no storage space . Update : I view the fact that they wash off easily as a good feature because I have little kids who may want a new one every day , but if you want something that will last for a week this is not your solution . Definitely a kids toy .	1
I had these as gifts at our company picnic and the girls loved them ! I will definitely buy them again next year !	1
I ordered these butterfly tattoos for my 2 daughters ' double birthday party . Somehow I accidently ordered 2 packs , so I have enough to last till they are in high school , which is fine because they were cheap and the girls all love them . I like that they are individual pieces so I 'm not running around with scissors in a group of 2 through 4 year olds like you have to with the usual sheets of temporary tattoos . The colours are n't as bright as I expected , which makes them look almost a little too realistic ! Some of the tattoos seemed to stay sticky and/or smudge on the skin , but I think that may be due to the way they were applied . It was 'parent participation ' and lots of different people were helping out , so I do n't want to judge that too harshly , as it may have been due to poor application . And they are durable , some stayed for a week despite baths every night , so I used some jojoba oil and wiped them off finally !	1
Purchased these for my Wonderful Niece & she 's been covered in them since she opened them . The colors & designs are Great & Vibrant . Very easy to apply & easy to remove too . Very Glad I got these for her ; )	1
butterflies are so serene to look at and the boys and girls both like them - large pack to use for treat bags	1
The colors are vibrant . They stay on for quite a while . Can easily be removed with a little rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover . Also come off with some scrubbing with soap and water but this takes much longer .	1
These seemed a little more difficult than typical tattoos to put on . It took a lot of water and pressure to get them to release from the paper . For the price and quantity you get , still a decent buy .	1
I love this doll because is very cute , very fashion and have a lot of details , the hair is beautiful just the right doll for my daughter to play of a beauty salon and make a lots of hair styles .	1
this doll looks great and is well made , it 's heavy duty enough to stand the hands of very energetic children .	1
This was a gift for a niece of mine and she loved it ! She has several dolls that were purchased locally at around $ 20- $ 25 . I was thrilled when I found it at less than half that and was somewhat skeptical . However , the product is quality and is just like what you see in the store . I highly recommend it .	1
My daughter and I both enjoy collecting the Monster High dolls . They are fun and different.Each doll has a different personallity . They are like a blast from the past with most of them related to a monster from days gone by .	1
I actually bought this for my daughters birthday . However . There were 3 more coming out in the line up so I waited and have been holding on to them for Xmas . That has been a long time now and many more dolls and sets bought since then . This will be great as she will have the complete set of the picture day set . Along with all the others . Really like these . They are colorful and I believe they will bring hours and hours of fun to my daughter the collector .	1
oh just so lovely ! My daughter has added her to her ever growing collection , she came as a fast ship , great job to amazon , and the price was just right ! She has a most bright and colorful outfit on , much like her dawn of the dance costume , and its just a very cute line , this pic day doll is a hit ! thank you very much	1
Frankie comes in a blue and black box that completely matches her and her accessories . I purchased this doll for my 8 year old foster daughter for her & # 34 ; Very Merry Unbirthday & # 34 ; . She loves monster high and had exclaimed that Frankie was the prettiest multiple times . If she ever got a doll- she wanted Frankie . And I see why . Frankie is adorable . I believe is supposed to be a female & # 34 ; Frankenstein & # 34 ; ( hence the name Frankie ? ) .She has very big black eye lashes and a little scar stitched on the side of her cheek . Her hair is gray and white . She has a very light blue/gray skin . Her legs and arms also have a few scars stitched on as well . Her neck has the bolts sticking out of the sides . She is wearing a blue faux leather jacket , a black and blue skirt/shirt outfit , a plastic yellow belt , and blue/black/white stilettos . She comes with a blue portfolio ( does n't open ) , a blue/black/yellow plastic purse ( does n't open ) , and a black brush with the 'Monster High Skull ' design on the back.She is made of plastic . It 's not a vinyl 'Barbie-like ' material . It 's actually hard plastic . Her head moves up and down and side to side . Her wrists , elbows , and arms move in all directions . Her knees and thighs also move in all directions . Her hair is tied back in a pony tail with a rubber band . She also has bangs . Once the hair is taken out of the pony tail it 's very full and easy for young girls to comb . It does n't tear out when brushed . There are no bald spots- like some dolls have when the pony tail is removed.The attention to detail and quality in this doll is amazing . It 's very well made . Even if the arm does pop off ( which occasionally happened with rough play by her brother in our house ) the child can snap it back on by themselves . Both of her siblings love this doll as well . It 's not just 'girly'- her brother will pick it up sometimes too.The doll comes with a small school 'yearbook ' that lists all of the monster high characters as well as a bit about them . It 's made of magazine-quality paper . It 's glossy . It also comes with a page of stickers of all of the monster high characters . The stickers stick very well . I should know- they 're not plastered all over the computer I am writing this on.I love Monster High and find it to be a really great toy for young girls . Granted the clothes are a bit skimpy ( unfortunately most dolls now-a-days have that quality ) - but the message behind them is great . My kiddos are a different race than me and Monster High really preaches that it does n't matter what culture or background you come from- deep down everyone is the same . I find that to be a beautiful message and love that Monster High is race-friendly . It 's not really targeted towards one skin color of young girls ( like Barbie 's and other dolls tend to be ) .The plastic of this doll is thick and durable . It 's very easy to clean ! And it has n't broken yet ( which with my kids is a feat that deserves an applause ) . She 's very well loved and very well-played with . My kids ages 7 to 10 all love her and I 'm so happy I bought her . She was the perfect gift and has held up with outstanding quality . Aside from the fact her arm sometimes pops out of place ( that 's why I rated it 4 stars- as I could see some people saying that that is n't a 5 star quality ) - she really is a great doll .	1
Our 9 year old granddaughter collects anything 'Monster High ' . They all seem to be well made and , most important , she loves it !	1
Frankie 's look may be young but her expression is the usual cross between girl who just came to life and girl who just was compiled on the lab table . I like the bangs and ponytail -- a better look than she had in the DOTD Frankie version . The safety pin purse is fabulous !	1
These are really built good and sturdy very good colors done to perfict color very neat hair styles.I would recomend them to buy for your kids .	1
I purchased these for my niece and she loved them . It seems to be really good quality for a doll and the hair even brushes easily and the joints move . Would purchase again .	1
What can I say about this Frankie except that she is totally `` voltageous '' . Everything about this doll is perfect from head to toe . Her long straight black and white hair is pulled into a high ponytail on top of her head and she has blunt cut hard bangs . Her facepaint is GOREgeous . Her lips are bright fuchsia pink . Her eyes have turquoise shadow from her lids to just above the crease of her eye and lining her lower lashes . She has very light yellow eyeshadow on her browbones that is dusted with iridescent glitter . She has very thick black eyeliner and eyelashes that sweep up . It gives her a very dramatic eye look . Her face kind of reminds me of dawn of the dance Frankie . The stitches on her cheek are kind of blurry on the doll I got , not crisp and sharp like they usually are . It does n't look terrible , just not as nice as it could be . Her bolts are very shiny metallic silver . She has light silver/grey earrings that look like the heads of two nuts or screws with one being a little larger than the other . She has two very thin bracelets on her left wrist , one turquoise and one black . Her sleeveless V-neck mini dress is made of a very silky and shiny material . It has large black and white diagonal stripes with thin turquoise stripes running between the black and white . The dress has two ruffles at the hem , one being the same material as the rest of the dress and one being a black , grey , and turquoise diamond print . There is a yellow lightning bolt running down the front of the dress and an adorable yellow satin collar at the neckline . She wears a turquoise pleather 3/4 sleeve jacket over the dress . There are thick black ribbon trims at the end of each sleeve of the jacket and the left sleeve has an additional thinner yellow and black ribbon sewn on . This jacket is very well made and one my favorite monster high clothing pieces I have seen . I wish I had a jacket like this ! ! She wears a yellow plastic belt with molded on bolt details , that closes in the front with an adorable skullette buckle . Her shoes are white and turquoise with a black geometric open wedge heel design . The left heel has a white toe and blue heel , the right shoe is colored in the reverse with a blue toe and white heel.There are little black bolts painted on the outer heel of each shoe . Her purse is turquoise and yellow with a large silver safety pin handle and black flap closure that actually opens . She also comes with a turquoise `` folder '' that actually opens and closes as well . It is embossed with a skullette and some stitches on the front and a diamond pattern with little lightening bolts and hearts . She comes with her `` fearbook '' which has a sheet of 16 stickers showing various monster high students in their fearbook picture pose . It also shows the faculty and has tells you who Frankie voted for cutest couple , ghoul spirit , etc . and has one page with all of the students autographs . This Frankie comes with a black stand and brush . I love the use of yellow as an accent color in this Frankie . It is fresh and really sets off the other colors on the doll . I just really like everything about her . Mattel did a great job on this one ! !	1
It was perfect it looked just the way it did in the picture . All of the eccessories were a great addition my daughter looooved it .	1
My niece wanted a Frankie Stein doll - the price was great plus I did not have to stand in a long line to purchase it ( Christmas gift ) .	1
This is a really lovely version of Monster High 's resident rockabilly . Operetta looks fantastic in a poofy skirt , removable corset , and varsity jacket . That roll in her hair can get a little wild , but a little finesse will have her looking fine in no time . Be warned that her mask is different from her prototype , which showed a new , spiderweb style ; she wears her usual heart instead . Operetta comes with a brush , stand , folder , and customizable fearbook .	1
I purchased this as a Christmas present for my 6 year old daughter who fell in love with it right away . The doll has adorable accessories ( including a little & # 34 ; bleeding heart purse & # 34 ; ) and very bright colored hair and clothing . The arms pop out at the elbow but they easily pop right back in , so if she 's a little rough it 's okay . I mean , they are monsters after all . The mask is cute , it 's actually an extension of the earring and it 's spider webbed on the side and in the front is a heart over one eye . It 's not intended for small children ( you know , the ones who stick everything in their mouths ) , but for young girls it 's a creative doll to play with .	1
I bought this doll back in March , when I saw her and the other two new PD dolls in Wal-Mart . I did n't know at the time the version of Operetta was a goof - she 'd been released with her heart-shaped mask and the jewelry from her Dot Dead Gorgeous doll , not the webbed version pictured here . She was pulled from the cases , assuming to fix this issue.When I saw her being sold by a third party vendor here for retail , with Amazon Prime shipping , I thought I 'd see if the issue had been dealt with . Received her today and , nope , it 's the same mistake doll I already have . I do n't fault the seller for this , they can only put up the photo released by Mattel.I 'm posting this review as a heads up for anyone who may be ordering this doll online - you 're not gon na get Operetta as pictured . I have n't come across any fan who 's bought the correct version of this particular doll . No clue as to when Mattel will re-release Operetta with the correct mask , either.As for the doll outside of that , a few previous reviews have been wonderful with their descriptions of everything else BUT the mask issue.EDIT 8/9/2013 - Contacted Amazon and a nice guy named Andy assured me if you order FROM THEM you should get the doll pictured , not the goof . If you do get the goof , they 'll replace it . If the goof turns out to be what they have , they 'll pull the photo from the site and put up the photo of the doll they DO have .	1
actually bought this for my daughters birthday . However . There were 3 more coming out in the line up so I waited and have been holding on to them for Xmas . That has been a long time now and many more dolls and sets bought since then . This will be great as she will have the complete set of the picture day set . Along with all the others . Really like these . They are colorful and I believe they will bring hours and hours of fun to my daughter the collector .	1
Operetta is fashion forward . One of the few dolls they actually will attempt anything interesting with her hair . She usually has a complete & # 34 ; look & # 34 ; , which is always a relief . Operetta is typically given a bit more edge and fun to her general fashion statement . The letter ghouls jacket is so retro cool . No wonder it is difficult to find this doll anywhere but online . If you like Operetta get this one .	1
Operetta is my favorite MONSTER HIGH ghoul and this is my favorite version of her ! Freaky FABULOUS ! ! ! The details and the accessories and the perfection is amazing ! ! !	1
This Operetta is just beautiful ! All her little details are great , the dress is very pretty , her hair is just fantastic ( and set with enough gel that it 's solid ! ) , and it comes with a cute picture book you can put stickers in . One thing that is not shown in any of the photos is that her shoes have a red stripe on the inside panel.If you can get your hands on this doll she is definitely worth adding to your collection	1
This is such a gorgeous Operetta . She is the hardest to find in this wave of picture day so it took me forever to finally get her but she was sooo worth the wait . Her hair is amazing . It is drawn up into a high ponytail at the back of her head and she has a single large victory roll at the front of her hairline . Her hair is mostly scarlet red with a black stripe starting at each temple and one black stipe at the front of her hairline curling into the victory roll . Her makeup is simple but pretty . She has very dark pink eyeshadow lining both her upper and lower lids with medium purple in her crease and shimmering white at her browbone . Her lips are a very deep garnet . Her eyemask is not the one pictured . It has a red spider where the mask goes into her ear , that opens into a black web and that turns into a heart around her eye . I had heard rumors that this might be corrected to the web design seen in the stock photo but apparently that has not happened yet . In her right ear she wears a black earring composed of four records of varying size . She wears a strapless sweetheart neckline dress that is red with a print of black musical notes . There is a light red or pink ( it is hard to tell ) tulle ruffle with black glitter dots at her hips and the bottom of the skirt is lined with a dark purple tulle ruffle . Over her dress around her waist she wears an adorable black underbust corset/waist cincher with white painted on lacing . This is a separate piece from the dress . To top it off she wears the cutest pleather white and purple monster high jacket . It has 3/4 length sleeves and purple ribbon detailing at the hem and arm cuffs . She wears white and black spectator/spats style booties . The are mostly white with black toe caps and a black curled heel with a spider web design . They have some black buttons and a red stripe on the inner part of each bootie . She has black fishnet anklets on under her booties . I love this little detail . She has a red `` pearl '' bracelet on her right wrist . Her purse is amazing ! ! ! It is a heart/musical note . The notehead is a heart shape . The inner heart in the purse is red with the outer part being black with a web design and `` drips '' coming down the bottom . It has a flag of the musical note coming up the side . She comes with a little magenta folder/portfolio as well . It is covered front and back in an embossed web design with a little spider on the flap closure . Included as well is her `` fearbook '' . It shows nominations for which student is fastest , most stylish , etc . It also has photos of some of the staff and students and a sticker sheet with various monster high characters . Last but not least she comes with a black brush and stand . Overall I love this Operetta . She looks like she could have come straight out of any high school circa 1955 . She has loads of little details and is just a beautiful doll .	1
This doll is amazingly designed . From the dress to the shoes , and especially the MH Jacket - it 's a nice and refreshing look for Operetta . Her hair is styled with a giant curl , although parents getting this doll for their younger children should probably expect it to fall out if the child decides to brush her hair , but a simple boil-perm will bring it right back to life ! The only thing I would mention is that the hair and the mask are different than the promo photos show - I have uploaded a photo explaining the differences , although when you see the doll in person its obvious - but both looks work and there is no telling if this will change with future Operetta 's down the line.All in all I would defiantly recommend this doll to anyone who collects MH girls !	1
Love her hair style she is so like a rock n roll 80 's theme doll she is perfect & she , i have built up a big collection since i bought these dolls	1
THIS IS NOT THE FULL GAME ! This is simply a huge deck of cards meant to add on to the original game . This is our family 's favorite board game & we currently have four expansions to it . I am very pleased with it & totally recommend the expansions to anyone who enjoys this game.If you do not own the original game you can order it here : http : //www.amazon.com/Asmodee-DX01US-Dixit/dp/2914849656/ref=sr_1_1 ? ie=UTF8 & qid ; =1400180938 & sr ; =8-1 & keywords ; =dixitYou will not regret ordering this game unless you do not enjoy board/card games . : )	1
Dixit Quest is a great expansion for Dixit . It comes with 84 cards that allow you to expand your game play . I have 5 kids and our family of seven loves this game and having the expansion allows us to have more cards to give more variety to one of our favorite games .	1
I 've had the original Dixit for a few months , and had a blast playing it with my family . I wanted something to add some 'freshness ' to our games , so I added this expansion . It integrates seamlessly with the other cards , and DOUBLED the size of my deck.The artwork is just as strange , magical , and fairy-tale like as the original cards , and does not jar at all . New players would n't be able to distinguish them from the base set , which is perfect ! I also bought some plastic sleeves for my whole game , which I highly recommend , as the whole game is based on the pristine artwork of these cards . I bought these sleeves : Swan Panasia Card Sleeves DixitNOTE : This is an expansion , and you need to have the original game for full playability . The original has colored voting tokens ( # 1-6 ) and the corresponding rabbits ( score counters ) , along with a scoreboard with organized placement for the cards which are in play . This expansion is simply 84 more cards . You can find the original Dixit 'base game ' here : [ [ ASIN:291484965 Asmodee DX01US Dixit ] ]	1
This is a fun game and with the new added expansion cards it makes for a more enjoyable game each time played . My guests request this game each time we get together for game night .	1
This is a great game for family/friend game night ! Creativity is a must . Lots of laughs , lots of fun . Good for most any age ... children or children at heart . Make sure you are aware before purchasing that this is an expansion , the game components are not included in this version . You must own the original Dixit before purchasing this one , as this one is only adding more cards .	1
If you own Dix it you need this expansion ! The more cards the better ! The game itself is one of the best party/art games I 've played . A must have for anyone that likes board games .	1
she is really great and nice as alll Monster high dolls ) Lagoona is the most beautiful doll ) and i like this collection	1
This was bought for my granddaughter . The first thing she did was remove the jewelry and anything small that came with it as she did n't want to lose it and then gave me a list of all the ones she & # 34 ; needs & # 34 ; .	1
This doll arrived quickly and was in protective packaging so that the box was in perfect shape and ready to fulfill a little girl 's birthday wish . Great price and delivery- would order again !	1
I purchased a few of these dolls for a toy drive at Christmas . The packaging was great and the doll looked very nice . I 'm sure she made some child 's Christmas more fun .	1
My daughter received her for Christmas and loves her . The outfit is cute and well made , and her face art is done very well without being over the top . The only Con about the doll are the removable fins on her legs -- I get that it is necessary for them to be removable in order to get pants on and off -- but they do n't lock in very well and are VERY easily lost or misplaced . My daughter and I have just removed the fins entirely and put them away , which is too bad because those fins on her legs were unique and super cute .	1
Her outfit is very cute . Lagoona 's hair is very curly and well maintained . Everything just looks great on this version of Lagoona . No dislikes or problems . Anyone who likes Monster High or Lagoona in particular will like this doll .	1
PD Lagoona has seahorses and fishbones all over her outfit , a great shiny pink n silver scaled cutie pants , mis match earrings dangling shells and a seahorse tail and a puffer fish pink and yellow handbag that could also be a sea urchin handbag and her school folder has a seahorse clasp -- can you tell I love seahorses ? She and Frankie are my fave characters and I have nearly all their dolls . The other PD dolls did n't really do it for me -- the best line so far I think for all dolls has been Ghouls Rule , followed by the Sweet 1600 line , again for all the dolls being ones I collected .	1
These are put together very good . My daughters just loved them . They really are built good and heavy . They had fun playing with them .	1
This was the first Monster High doll that my daughter received and she loves it . It is great quality and looks great .	1
So for me personally , the wave 2 picture day dolls have so far been pretty hard to find at retailers . I have been scouring Target , Wal-Mart . etc , to no avail . So imagine my surprise when I found a lone Lagoona on the shelf at Toys R Us last night . Without a second thought I grabbed her up . Her hair this time is long , down to her waist , and predominantly yellowish blonde with blue streaks . It has a slight waves/curliness to it and a piece of her hair in the front is pulled over to the side . She has very pale pink eyeshadow at her lashline , with a darker hot pink along the crease of her eye , and iridescent glitter along her browbone . Her lips are a very light pastel pink . For accessories she wears a translucent yellow tentacle earring in her left ear , and a translucent pink rope and shell earring in her right ear . On her right wrist is a gold bracelet made of little connected balls , and her left wrist has a thin pink bracelet . Her dress is done in an A-line shape . The material has a teal backround with a print of pink orange and chartreuse coral and black fishbones and seahorses . The bodice of the dress is done with a shiny iridescent coral colored material . It has a little bow on the front that is shaped to look kind of like seashells ( like the bra Ariel wore in the little mermaid ) . There is a thin iridescent ribbon tied around her neck and a lime green tulle ruffle at the hem of the dress . She wears a black fishnet short sleeve shrug over the dress . Under the dress , she wears some super cute capri leggings . The are bright pink with shiny silver dots all over them that make them shine and sparkle . Her metallic gold `` rope '' belt is adorable , and probably my favorite accessory of this particular doll . She carries a pink purse which is reminiscent of a sea urchin or anemone with a yellow seaweed strap . Her wedge slides are translucent teal blue and made of different size `` bubbles '' all stuck together . The wedge heel has some adorable little cutouts as well . She comes with a seafoam green folder/portfolio that actually opens up . It has a fishscale motif molded in the front as well as a little seahorse at the closure . Her included fearbook has a sheet of 16 mini stickers that show various monster high students in their best fearbook pose . It also has pictures of the staff , an autograph page with signatures of her classmates , and a group pic . She comes with a black stand and black brush .	1
Doll was a bit pricey , it has held up well however . It is pretty well stuffed , plump , nice bright colors . If your kids are into Team Umizoomi this is a good purchase . It entices imaginative play and role acting , shutting off the TV and allowing for their creative minds to explore . The doll looks like the character . Overall , satisfied with the purchase .	1
I purchased this on Amazon because I could only find Geo and Bot locally and of course needed a completed set . She is made of the same quality and has held up nicely to my 2 year old daughters play . I do however agree that the price is not great considering I paid 9.99 for the other and when I purchased Milli she was 19.99 .	1
This is a nicely made and colorful toy , and its 8 inch size is just right . Milli sleeps with the other Team Umizoomi members Bot and Geo on a pillow right next to my granddaughter when she stays over my house.I bought this on Amazon at the end of November for 9.99 . The current price of 24.98 is ridiculous .	1
Our 2 year old daughter loves Mili and this is exactly what she wanted . Durable stitching . What you ca n't really see is that she has numbers on her hat for & # 34 ; Mili measure & # 34 ; which was a nice addition . Great kids toy .	1
I was afraid Annie would get lost in the shuffle of the engines my grandson already has , but everyone loves Annie and makes sure she gets to play too . So she 's not sad .	1
This was one of four Take-n-Play trains I ordered . All arrived in good condition . I know my nephew will enjoy Annie . Would recommend .	1
( First , please note that the accompanying photo is NOT the `` new '' 2013 Annie , which is sold separately from Clarabel and has a different colored roof , wheels and facial expression ... they just took a picture of the `` old '' Annie from the 2010 2-pack . ) If you have Thomas , you HAVE to have his loyal coaches , Annie & Clarabel ! We think Fisher-Price is counting on that ... they were introduced as a 2 pack in 2010 , and you can still find them as such with an $ 11 MSRP . But F-P has now `` tweaked '' them a little bit - giving them different facial expressions , darker roofs and wheels , and are `` re-introducing '' them in 2013 -- - SEPARATELY , so that you have to buy both ( F-P 's MSRP for their small trains/vehicles remains $ 6 , so we guess they want that extra buck ! ) Annie & Clarabel are the passenger coaches which were given to Thomas when he started working on his own branch line . They respect all of the engines , but particularly Thomas and Gordon ; they 're also quick to scold Thomas when he gets ornery - but he loves them dearly ! Annie always travels facing & coupled to Thomas , with Clarabel coupled to Annie and facing backward ... she prefers to watch the scenery ! F-P KNOWS you 'll want both , so they 've changed their packaging strategy . Our advice is to buy one of the 2-packs while they 're still available.If you 're interested in starting a rolling stock collection of your own , there are 21 items in the TnP line as of summer 2013 , and they are ( in order of introduction ) : Quarry Car , Annie & Clarabel ( 2 pack ) , Sodor Supply Co. , Rocky , Troublesome Truck , Diesel Fuel Tanker , Storybook Car , Sodor Zoo Snake Car , Bubble Tanker , Farm Animal Car , Sodor Mining Co. , Spider Exhibit Car , Sodor Cement Mixer , Sir Topham Hatt 's Musical Caboose , Crocodile Special , Talking Troublesome Trucks ( 2 pack ) , Sodor Circus Monkey , Oil Tanker , Hector , and separate re-introductions of Annie and Clarabel.We did want to add this `` tweaked '' version of Annie to the Take-n-Play collection we started in 2010 for our older grandson as soon as we saw her on Amazon for $ 5.99 with free shipping ( right at Fisher-Price 's $ 6 MSRP ) so that it 's a complete 4 years , but this is one more issue we 've added to our list of reasons to make this the last year for the collection , instead of continuing it for our younger grandchild . Now they 're using a `` re-introduction '' ploy - at no design cost to them - to squeeze another buck out of their customers . F-P has - in our opinion - really gone downhill on the product quality of the TnP line , particularly over the past year . They use a much lighter weight die-cast metal now for the trains & vehicles , have added a lot more plastic instead of metal when it comes to the rail cars , eliminated the `` chugging '' sounds from the talking engines , and are raising MSRPs on some items at the same time they 're reducing quality . We 've had so much fun interacting with our older grandson with this line , so we were really disheartened to see all of the quality shortcuts . At least our younger grandchild will be able to enjoy the collection of the first few years of the line , when it was definitely high quality with great attention to detail ! Always sad when a company starts sacrificing quality ... when will they realize it equates to lost customers ?	1
I have n't heard of Annie from watching the TV shows or reading the books to my son , but it did n't seem to matter . He loves this train , just like any other train . Shipping was timely and would totally do business with them again .	1
Great toy for the grandson . Small yet very easy for him to play with and do n't have to worry about being around mouth area . Sturdy and well built . Recommend .	1
I ca n't believe I paid twice as much for the wooden train . This does work well with the wooden Thomas , as they have matching magnets , but I did go ahead and buy the die cast Thomas also . The 2 year old immediately tossed the wooden Thomas to the side ( for a couple of hours , then retrieved him ) . Great value , works with his matchbox/hotwheels collections .	1
My 3 year old loves anything Thomas the Train , and his face lights up every time I purchase a new piece for him !	1
Ideal gift for those grandchildren who enjoy trains . My 2 year old grandson loves it and it has provided some truly unique opportunities to see his thought process . Magnetic attachments make it easy to connect to other trains . Interesting to see how our grandsons and granddaughter considered where in the line of trains this one would fit . Durable , well constructed , color true to that shown ... highly recommend .	1
This Take-n-Play was one of 4 ordered for my nephew to add to his collection . Well made and would recommend .	1
Stephen is one of the new characters introduced in 2013 's `` King of the Railway '' DVD . He 's also referred to as `` Rocket '' ... that 's because he 's based on the real-life `` Stephenson 's Rocket '' , the famous train who - in 1829 - began the `` steam age '' of trains ! Even though he 's a little slower and maybe not as strong as his `` newer '' friends . no one can top his positive spirit and knowledge . He has his own coaches , like Thomas . Grandpa & I snatched this little guy up when we saw him on Amazon for $ 5.99 with free shipping ( right at Fisher-Price 's MSRP of $ 6 ) to avoid the Christmas rush ! Grandpa and I started collecting Take-n-Play for our first grandson the year it came out ( 2010 ) , when he was about 2 1/2 . At the time , it was a high quality line of trains , vehicles and playsets that we felt would be durable enough for him to pass along to his own kids some day , and has provided countless hours of enjoyable interaction between us . We love watching him exercise his imagination and creativity as he comes up with new scenarios and adventures ! He turned 5 in April and still looks forward to visiting his Sodor land of make believe in our basement ; his little brother is 16 months old and it wo n't be long before he 's playing with them too . Hopefully when Grandpa and I are no longer around one day , their early memories of playtime with us will be as warm as ours already are , and they 'll be able to share more special memories with the next generation ! Unfortunately , the line in general has gone downhill over the past year , so this will be the last year of the collection . At least our younger grandchild will have the first few years of the collection to play with , before Fisher-Price started cutting corners .	1
My son loves Thomas the Train and we got this for him as a surprise . He plays with it and loves showing off all his Thomas toys .	1
gave this to a grandson and he just loves it . he said it goes well with his collections and this is his first steamie .	1
Stephen was a big hit for my grandson ! I think we will be buying Thomas products for years to come ! He is 5 and still loves all of the trains !	1
I like the design of this toy set from the imagery to the construction . I find it adequately durable for its purpose , but others might not agree . It 's cute and vibrant enough to catch our daughter 's eye , though she 'll need another year to fully be able to enjoy it . Its construction makes it a toy set we can worry a little less on . Cute toy has a theme that will get our little ones ready for school .	1
My bubble guppie fan squealed with delight when he saw this toy . He 's five and was able to put it together without assistance . I like that it is easy to assemble . The toy comes with 3 characters from the show . The characters have wheels on the bottom and they slide down the `` track '' . Several abbreviated songs from the show repeat during the rolling action . The songs are sped up and are repeated often . Annoying for me , but my son loves it . There is a lunch box that opens and closes and plays the `` lunch time song '' . After several minutes of play , my child loses interest . He enjoys it , but for only for limited amounts of time . I think this will be more entertaining for children under 3 .	1
Easy to set up ! Important to me , as I end up building a lot of toys for my kids and grandbabies ( 2yrs thru 5yrs ) ! ! I read some of the reviews , pro and cons , and the thing that ALMOST caught me in the store was that it does show all the bubble guppies on the box , but only a few come with it . Luckily , I read it closely and was able to purchase a few separately . This has an on/off switch so they CAN play with it without sound , but where 's the fun in that ? ? Lol . There 's a lunchbox ( built in ) with a lid that lifts up and they sings 3 different variations of their lunch time song . Mr. Grouper sits on a thick , little stem and initiates bubble guppie songs . The top slide goes down with a push on the little blue piece on the top ( seen in picture ) , then the large slide flops up and down OR the guppies can sit in a seat that rides downwards to the bottom . There 's two different purple floors that goes up and down ( reminds me of the floors in a fun house ) and bubble guppies sayings and songs come out . What 's even more fun is that if you get the bus , if you pull the bus along side of the toy , the guppies can slide into the bus from the top slide ! ! I try to look at all aspects of a toy , since money is an issue to me , and since this was a present from my son 's auntie ( I was with her when she got it ) , I was happy to see that the other guppie sets were NOT all that expensive so we are able to add guppies as I can afford them . Another con I read was that & # 34 ; she & # 34 ; had a child that threw toys , unfortunately my 2 yr old is too , but you cant always find toys that wont hurt when thrown . This may not be for her child , but my son gets engrossed in it right away and throwing is n't an issue while he plays with it ! ! The parts look sturdy and this unit has been fought over so its got clunked around and has held up just fine . One bit of personal advise , spend a little extra and get a guppie box ! ! This way all the characters have a place to go when playtime is through ! ! Otherwise they 'll be all over ! This is a great toy ! I hope your child will have much fun as my son and grandbabies have ! !	1
This product is more expensive than the Rock star stage but is a lot bigger and does more . Has a lot of different sayings when buttons are pushed . More interaction in the ramps as well .	1
My 3 year old granddaughter and my 5 year old grandson both enjoy this toy . They are both fans of the tv show and enjoying playing with the toy while watching . I have n't compared price point to other similar products , but for the amount of fun my grandkids have with it , seems worth the purchase to me .	1
My grandson loves this playset ! He loves the colors , activites and the sounds . I love it because it 's safe and keeps him busy and teaches him motor skills . I also love there are no pointed edges or parts to hurt him . Great for us to play with together or by himself too !	1
This toy is a good size , 2-3 children are able to play with it at the same time . It is colorful and fun . The pieces are large enough for our 3 year olds to hold onto without being put into mouths . They love the action slides and do n't seem to have any problems with them . This toy allows the kids to further develop their motor skills and use their imaginations , but other than that I see no educational value . That said , my opinion is that sometimes that is enough . It seems to be very durable , 3 year olds can be pretty tough on their toys !	1
My daughter is 6 . Santa brought it for her Christmas . She likes the Bubble Guppies . I ca n't say anything bad about this toy .	1
The guppies and the rolling figures need your help to go to school . There are many things to be done so they can get to the school , lunch and dance floor . Its fun to watch how one action after another guides the figures to the destination . And dont forget to pull up the elevator after it is used , unless you want to take care of injuries . The colourful slide , lunch options are all fun to watch.The toy is educational like the mechanical device setup where one thing lead to another , simple steps lead to a final great result . All along there ' peppy voices .	1
My 6 yr old loves the Bubble Guppies and was jumping up and down with excitement when this arrived . Un-boxing it took longer than putting it together , everything just snaps in place . No tools needed . The 3 characters it comes with allow for play right away , without having to buy all the add on componants . The sound is a little LOUD , so I 'm going to go looking for a switch tonight .	1
I have 6 year-old twin girls who are fans of the Bubble Guppies . They love this playset . It 's kept them occupied and there is enough for both of them to play with it together.For me , it was easy to assemble - always a plus , and already came with batteries.The one drawback is that the talking part is quite loud , although this can be turned off . Even with 50 phrases it becomes a little repetitive .	1
My grandson loves the Bubble Guppies , and he really enjoyed this play set . The characters roll and bump along & # 34 ; & # 34 ; mousetrap & # 34 ; style , the music and voices are cute just like the cartoon . Lots of buttons to push . It says 18 months and up but I think a child would need to be at least 2 1/2 to really be able to enjoy this . However , my 6 year old granddaughter loved it , too . It seems well made , and I think it is going to be a good toy to pass on to the nieces and nephews when these two are done with it , which from the looks of things , may be awhile !	1
The grandkids love this toy . The school bell ringing and the `` voices '' make them laugh . This is a toy that will grow with them . I know they will be singing along with the songs and playing with it for years to come . We have already decided to add more guppies sets and the school bus .	1
My daughter loves this toy , cute not annoying , it has a slide , includes figures and I like it too . A definite win win in my opinion .	1
My 2 1/2 year old twins love Bubble Guppies , so I was excited to try this playset . The toy itself is very simple , just a couple of slides and an `` elevator . '' A rolling Molly and Gil are included . Mr. Grouper is also there , but he does n't move . The toy plays ( somewhat loudly ) several Bubble Guppy favorites , including `` Line Up '' and `` It 's Time for Lunch . '' Unlike some reviewers , we have n't had any problems with the elevator coming off of the toy , and my kids were able to figure out how to use the elevator after I demonstrated it . I would like to purchase the rest of the Guppies for this set , but locally all I can find is the `` Rock Star '' versions of Guppies , and I ca n't tell if they will work on this or not . I have also decided to get the school bus that goes with this set , because I think it will add to the play value of the set . Overall , the twins are happy with this toy , and when they are happy , I am happy .	1
The little & # 34 ; chair & # 34 ; on the left side of the toy is easily pulled off , but it 's a plastic kid toy ... they all do that , especially when you have a son that needs to try to deconstruct everything he can . This toy has lots of sayings and things to push to make the toy talk , either with Mr. Grouper 's voice or one of the bubble guppies . Probably too young for any child over the age of 2 or 2.5 , but great for my 18 month old for now .	1
My husband was so happy when we received this toy because it required no tools to assemble : ) This toy was easily to snap the pieces in and my kids could hardly wait to start playing with it . This item does take batteries , but it came with some already in the toy so you wo n't need any right away . It came with 3 characters ( Mr. Grouper , Gil and Molly ) . This toy has lots of sound so it will keep little ones busy for a while . My son is 3 and he loves this toy . My son was so excited because he watches Bubble Guppies on Nick Jr . I would definitely recommend this toy to others .	1
My grandson loved this toy . It immediately capture his full attention because Bubble Guppies is one of his favorite TV shows . This delightful toy sparked imagination and laughter . Although not educational it is tons of fun . I believe that sometimes just good old fashion fun is just as important as education . A great toy for your toddler .	1
I picked up this playset for my daughter through Amazon Vine . She loves Bubble Guppies . Before we got this toy , though , we made sure that she understood it was basically a ramp toy and that the figures that came with it did n't have moveable parts , they just roll on the ramps . Once we were confident she was fine with that fact , we ordered it for her.The ramps works perfectly . My only concern is the chair elevator that suspends from the top of the green pole you see in the picture . It is made so that when a figure rolls onto it , it slides down and then the figure continues on the bottom ramp . So far , it works great , but the chair seems to barely lock into place at the top of the pole , which I realize is necessary for it to function , but it seems to barely stay in place . I 'm not sure how long it will continue working properly.The sounds are loud - be warned - but the music is enjoyable and the sayings are varied . There 's a lunch tray that flips to reveal different types of food , and the sounds react accordingly.The dance floor is powered by pushing a lever down repeatedly , and it basically lifts the floor up and down , making the figurines bounce a bit . I do n't mind this feature because it 's good for the child to have some kinetic engagement.All in all , I was very pleased with this toy and would recommend it . However , make it clear that the sounds and the ramps are the focal points of the play set . The figurines are basically made to roll on the ramps , which they do well , but they have no moving parts .	1
My 2-yr-old daughter is a HUGE , HUGE Bubble Guppies fan and loves this playset . My husband and I are not as impressed as we would like , though . The slide does n't function like it should . You are supposed to put the Bubble Guppie on the top of the slide and it 's supposed to slide all the way down the the bottom . Ours does not do that . It slides down the top slide and down the second slide and stops at the little seat that is supposed take the Guppie down to the bottom of the playset where it 's supposed to trigger the song button . The seat does not drop onto the button like it should . The Guppie just slides into the seat and the seat does n't move 9 times out of 10 . Our daughter just pushes the seat down and moves the Guppie along , though , and does n't seem to mind . Except when the seat falls off entirely when the Guppie slides in . THEN she freaks out . Fortunately , the seat just pops back on easily and she 's happily playing again . The songs are cute and catchy and she plays with it daily ... We just wish it worked as advertised . Maybe we got a bum playset ... Who knows ?	1
The child playing with this toy was not familiar with Bubble Guppies , until now . The songs certainly are catchy and got this little one to want to watch the show . So far , he 's sat on it , put things not designed to go in it , in it ... and over-worked every moving part . I 'd say it 's holding up well ! I do n't know if he 'll lose interest in it , but for the past 2-weeks , it 's his go-to toy . The show is holding his interest , as well . I think adding other Bubble Guppies brand toys will expand his playtime with it .	1
We 've seen this Bubble Guppies School on tv ads and in Fisher Price catalogs for months . My 3.5 yr old son was instantly intrigued and it quickly made his list of toys he 'd really love , so we splurged for his bday . Overall , he likes it and has been busy playing with it so we are happy and giving it 4 stars . But there are so many little things that are flaws with it , it makes it hard to justify paying nearly $ 40 for ! My goodness the quality of toys has sure diminished since we were kids.Began with pretty easy assembly overall . There is not a volume control , and its volume setting is super loud ! Even my son commented to turn it down . So we put clear tape over the speaker and it helps tone it down . There are a ton of songs and phrases with real voices just like the cartoon , this was a pleasant surprise . Even includes the ( 3 ) lunchboxes with the 'what 's for lunch ' recordings . And the 'line up ' song too . All big hits with the kid.If you buy the school and matching bus , that is supposed to go with it , they BOTH include Gil and Mr.Grouper ... .which seems silly since they encourage you to buy them together then give you the same characters ? ? Also , the slide deal just is not working like on the commercials ... ..not surprised . Our guppies never make it to the 2nd slide on their feet ( or wheel , I should say ) . The drop from 1st to 2nd slide always tips them over . And if you try to lower the 2nd slide to let them all roll into the matching bus as they show you , the flimsy slide gets crooked and the guppies barely make it into the bus w/o help . Disappointment seeing that the bus was just as expensive as the school.These flaws are more of my mom-opinion than my son 's , since he still seems to be enjoying it a lot . So I still recommend it for Bubble Guppies fans but beware its not all its hyped up to be . ( :	1
The toy is easy to get out of the box and put together . No screwing , unscrewing , or cutting wires . It takes only a couple of minutes to assemble and is very durable . The parts are big enough to not worry about swallowing small pieces.The first thing I noticed about this is how loud it is ! If you are a parent that ca n't tolerate a lot of noise , you wo n't like this . There is no volume control . It 's either full blast or off.The four year old who plays with this loves it though . The songs are cute and make it a lot of fun for her .	1
The thing about this toy is that there is not much to play with , but gets the child to be in a imaginative world.My daughter who is 4+ loves this toy - I typically tell her a story around each toy that I get her and then she continues the story part for the toy . And for the last 3 days , this toy has become the center piece for her to show all the guests who visit home ! Maybe another week till she gets back to her other toys.Overall - a nice toy for girls 2-4 years old . Anything older - may not like this .	1
I purchased this Thomas the Train , Take-n-Play Millie for my four year year old great grandson who was just thrilled to get another Thomas the Train present . He loves this train and all the others I purchased for his birthday and I was very happy that I had gotten it for him . He is still enjoying this present .	1
The colors are so bold and wonderful , it is a perfect addition to anyone that collects trains . My son enjoys it everyday .	1
Millie ! Great surprise from Santa to have Millie under the tree . Goes well with the King of the Railway movie .	1
as all the other Thomas trains this one is well made . sturdy and I know my little nephew will just love adding it to his collection .	1
We 'll be looking forward to adding this little lady , a new character stemming from 2013 's `` King of the Railway '' DVD , as soon as we see her at a reasonable price ! Millie is a private steam engine who 's owned by Sir Robert Norramby ( much as Spencer is the private engine of the Duke & Duchess of Boxford ) - she 's French , and a very vivacious character ! She 's the newest Narrow Gauge engine , and works at Ulfstead Castle , taking visitors on tours and helping the grounds keeper . She 's light blue and has an open topped carriage , and in the DVD she has Sir Robert 's crest on her cab sides ( though it does n't appear so on the photo accompanying this listing ... it looks like her name is on her engine . ) Fisher-Price 's MSRP for Millie is $ 6 , and we grabbed her as soon as Amazon lowered her price to $ 5.99 plus free shipping - do n't have to worry about her being out of stock at Christmas now ! Grandpa and I started collecting Take-n-Play for our first grandson the year it came out ( 2010 ) , when he was about 2 1/2 . At the time , it was a high quality line of trains , vehicles and playsets that we felt would be durable enough for him to pass along to his own kids some day , and has provided countless hours of enjoyable interaction between us . We love watching him exercise his imagination and creativity as he comes up with new scenarios and adventures ! He turned 5 in April and still looks forward to visiting his Sodor land of make believe in our basement ; his little brother is 16 months old and it wo n't be long before he 's playing with them too . Hopefully when Grandpa and I are no longer around one day , their early memories of playtime with us will be as warm as ours already are , and they 'll be able to share more special memories with the next generation ! Unfortunately , the line in general has gone downhill over the past year , so this will be the last year of the collection . At least our younger grandchild will have the first few years of the collection to play with , before Fisher-Price started cutting corners .	1
Any Thomas the train fan like my daughter will love Millie..great addition to the Thomas collection . Great colors ! Peep peep !	1
It 's well made . My 4-years-old son loves it ! Good size for the little hands to take along with . Nice color	1
Got for my 3 year old great nephew to go with other Thomas pieces . It is great and he loves it !	1
This was one of 4 Take-n-Play that was ordered , the others were James , Annie and Stephen . Never realized that there were so many to choose from . If you have a little one who loves to watch Thomas and his friends on tv these will be great . They all connect be a magnet in the front and back of each piece . A good buy and I 'll be back for more in the future .	1
Even though it is on the small side , my son loves his Harvey toy ! Of course he loves all his Thomas characters they are very well made .	1
This will be our last year collecting Take-n-Play for our older grandson , so we 're happy to see Harvey arrived in time to join it ! He 's the big-hearted , cheerful tank engine - first appearing in TV Season 6 ( 2002 ) - who 's a bit different from the other tank engines , in that he has a crane mounted on top of his boiler . A handsome looking engine , he 's burgundy colored with yellow lining and square buffers , and a yellow number 27 on both sides of his crane arm , and his name printed in yellow on his sides . He has a hook at the end of his crane arm , so be aware of that ... do n't want youngsters who are too small getting hold of it ! His difference makes him very useful when it comes to hoisting cargo , as well as cleaning up messes , and he 's always ready to offer comfort or advice . We ordered Harvey to add to his collection as soon as we saw Amazon lower its price to $ 5.99 ( Fisher-Price 's MSRP is $ 6 . ) We would 've enjoyed continuing the collection for our younger grandson , but we 've seen too many reductions in the quality of the line over the past year , which is a shame . It was a `` good ride '' while it lasted !	1
Son has a collection of Thomas the Tank engines toys and this one added to it . He loves it a lot .	1
another add on to the grandkids collection of Thomas n friends . he also loves Harvey as it picks up trains that falls off track when he plays or whatever his imagination takes him .	1
Purchased at Grandson 's request because he needed a hook and a magnet ! Both of which are on this train compliments his other engines	1
My Grandson already has some other cranes and he will enjoy Harvey as much as the others . He 'll be surprised .	1
My son really likes this train . Shipping was timely and I would definitely do business again . The only thing is that this specific train has small pieces for small children . It says 3+ , but I think some of the pieces are still small for a 3 year old .	1
Harvey has been a great addition to my grandson 's collection ! All of the Thomas products are of wonderful quality and very affordable !	1
Great product , my son loves it and all things thomas , but they are half the price of this at Wal-Mart . Save your money and get two .	1
a new train is always a hit . just wish the die cast fit the wooden tracks . but my son loves it	1
Hard to find Thomas the train toy . I was very happy to find Harvey online because my 5 year old son loves the unique take-n-Play toys . He is autistic & always has to have a train in I his hands to keep him calm . He has so many trains that he was getting tired of looking at the same ones over & over . I began to order him the most unique toys I could find so he would have a huge variety of characters - not just the trains . This was a great addition to his set of different shaped Thomas the train friends .	1
I was n't sure about these but they klop down fairly well without falling over . My one and three year old girls absolutely love playing with the castle and princesses .	1
Great addition to the klip klop castle . If you get multiple of these you can build another ramp using the food box !	1
ONCE AGAIN ANOTHER ONE TO ADD TO HER CHRISTMAS GIFT . SHE LOVES THEM SO WE GOT FOR HER . GREAT TOYS AND VERY WELL MADE .	1
We 've all seen these and their fun , you can connect several sets together to make the & # 34 ; ramp & # 34 ; longer or add to the Klip Klop Stable . Their fun , durable and a great price .	1
Our 3 year old daughter loves Disney princesses . The Little People klip Klop Ariel combines her favorite princess from the Little Mermaid with a Klip Klopping horse . The Klip Klop Ariel may not be overly-exciting on its own , but as part of the larger Little People Klip Klop Princess Stable it is a winner.Notes- Comes with Ariel on her horse , a small feeding trough , and a ramp that Ariel can Klip Klop down.- The ramp is pretty short , so Belle only gets about 3 or 4 Klip Klops before she runs out of ramp.- At times it is a bit difficult to get Ariel ( or any of the Klip Klop Princesses ) set-up so that they can Klip Klop without falling over.Final Verdict - while the Klip Klop Ariel may not be a lot of fun as a stand alone toy , as part of the Little People Klip Klop Princess Stable it is a sure winner.4 1/2 Stars if you own the Little People Disney Princess Klip Klop Stables - 2 1/2 Stars without it	1
My daughter really wanted the Klip Klop castle as a whole , but it just seems like it would take up our whole house , but honestly , she loves this toy and does n't want the whole castle anymore . We got it for six bucks at yoyo-dot-com ( have to spell it so the amazon gods wo n't strike ) nd you might want to look at the prices on the fp site itself , but we definitely got our money 's worth out of it ! It 's slightly challenging to get the horse to go down the ramp , but in a good way ( at least for a nearly 3 year old ) - because she seems to like the challenge of it and keeps her coming back ! The horse 's food accessory is so cute . It looks cuter in real life than on the website . Would be great to bring to a restaurant to keep little hands busy .	1
A happy little extra birthday gift . Works well to bring along in the car , as well as for sharing when using the stable .	1
These Fisher-Price Little People Disney Klip Klop dolls are just adorable . We have the whole set and it brings hours of fun .	1
Definitely cute . I got this to be a part of an entire collection that I ordered for my daughter 's first birthday .	1
These little figures are so much fun ! Love the klip-klop of the little horse.Grandchildren love them as much as me .	1
Our daughter loves these toys . Once it goes on the ramp , the toy horse clip/clops down and makes our daughter laugh .	1
I had the Belle Klip Klop , so I bought the Ariel and Cinderella ones too , and I am going to buy the Klip Klop Castle to go with them and give it to my daughter for Christmas . Very cute set all together = ]	1
I ordered this for my three girls , 4 , 2 , and 1 to go with their Fisher Price Klip Klop stable and it works perfect . Its exactly as described and works wonderfully with their stable . They like the bright colors and that it matches what Ariel Looks like in the Disney movie . I also love that the parts are durable and not too small , very age appropriate . I actually ordered this one with the Belle as well and they work perfect together when you stack the ramp on the food piece and then clip it on Belles ramp they have an extra long ramp . It is very easy to use for all my girls and my baby even liked it ! Would recommend this to add to your Little People Klip Klop stable .	1
Love it and it helps to almost complete her klip klop collection and my daughter loves the bright colors and the choices to choose from when playing with her stable	1
Just so darn cute ! Did not know there was a barn to be purchased when I bought these . So had to buy the barn as well.Any princess lover will have to have them .	1
I got this to go with the Klip Klop stable . I gave them to my granddaughter for Christmas . She 's had a lot of fun with it . She loves the different princesses , and it 's a fun addition to the stable . If you do n't have the stable , I do n't think it would be as fun .	1
I bought this to go with the Klip Klop pony farm set . This is a very cute addition and my daughter loves it !	1
My daughter loved having Ariel to go along with her Klip Klop play set . Ariel is cute and so is her horse !	1
I got this for my grandaughter for Christmas , her parents got her the stable and told me she was going to need items to go with it .	1
Great addition to the klip klop castle . If you buy multiple single sets , you can build a longer ramp with the food box and ramps .	1
It 's hard to explain how much fun this is to play with and to watch . I 'm not sure what the tack box is supposed to be for . It 's not really a box and appears to have treats on it . Making it a water trough would make more sense but I 'm not sure every set you buy needs to come with one .	1
WELL TO GO WITH THE KLIPPITY KLOP STABLE I BOUGHT EXTRA FOR GRAND DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS I KNOW SHE 'LL LOVE IT .	1
We love the Klip Klop stable set , so of course we had to find our little girls favorite princess ; Cinderella ! She is easy to recognize and she really completes our set . We actually purchased this for our 4 year old after she saw her 1 year old cousin with it at her birthday party . This is a great gift for ages 1-5 I would say !	1
These are really fun to play with ! The horse easily walk down the ramp and makes a clicking sound to give the affect of horses hooves and connecting other sets makes the ride a little longer . They also are good additions to the Klip Klop Stable . They are really durable , come in a variety of characters and have kept my 2 year olds attention for quite some time now . Good purchase !	1
Our 3 year old daughter loves Disney princesses . The Little People Klip Klop Cinderella combines her favorite princess from the Disney Movie `` Cinderella '' with a Klip Klopping horse . The Klip Klop Cinderella may not be overly-exciting on its own , but as part of the larger Little People Klip Klop Princess Stable it is a winner.Notes- Comes with Cinderella on her horse , a small feeding trough , and a ramp that Cinderella can Klip Klop down.- The ramp is pretty short , so Cinderella only gets about 3 or 4 Klip Klops before she runs out of ramp.- At times it is a bit difficult to get Cinderella ( or any of the Klip Klop Princesses ) set-up so that they can Klip Klop without falling over.Final Verdict - while the Klip Klop Cinderella may not be a lot of fun as a stand alone toy , as part of the Little People Klip Klop Princess Stable it is a sure winner.4 1/2 Stars if you own the Little People Disney Princess Klip Klop Stables - 2 1/2 Stars without it	1
This can be a great toy for young children . My 3 year old daughter loves it . Do not buy this toy for a child who does not already have the Klip Klop Stable . This is clearly an add-on princess . The ramp is just too short to be fun for long with Klip Klop Cinderella . They advertise that the ramps from the various klip klop princesses can attach to the other ramps , but they do n't really seem to do so easily or well . Cinderella only does 3 or 4 klip klops at best down the little ramp . My daughter absolutely adores playing with the klip klop princesses on the Klip Klop Stable , she just is n't much interested in the little ramp . She does like to pretend feed Cinderella 's horse at the little trough , but honestly , this does not feel like a complete toy without the stable .	1
We enjoyed ordering all of these Fisher-Price Little People Disney Klip Klop 's . My granddaughter loves playing with them . Does n't take much imagination to enjoy the set .	1
Cute accessory for the Klip Klop castle but super expensive for what this add on piece is . You basically have to have the castle in order to use this .	1
I had the Belle Klip Klop , so I bought the Cinderella and Ariel ones and I am going to buy the castle and give it to my daughter for Christmas . Very cute set all together = ]	1
My Grandaughter has all the princesses now for her castle and would recommend for purchase , works great . Study and durable .	1
Love the klip klop princesses . These extra pieces hook together . I only wish they could hook onto the stable somewhere for extra play area .	1
We bought this a addition to my daughter 's klip klop stable . Could n't have asked for anything better . She loves this toy !	1
again bought this to go with her klip klop stables that we got her for Christmas and love the whole set , my daughter likes having different horsey ( as she calls them ) options to choose from and likes to race them down the ramps and see who wins . great purchase	1
Just so darn cute ! Goes with the barn and the rest of the princesses . Stores have very limited selections so this is a great find .	1
My daughter loved having Cinderella to go along with her Klip klop playset . Cinderella and her horse are both very cute !	1
I bought this for my grandaughter for Christmas , her parents go her the stable and told me she was going to need this to go with it .	1
What a hit ! All the horses and princes were a hit with my great-granddaughter . She loves them all . What a hit !	1
Great price for the product . It 's the same as you would get anywhere else but a much better price . Other places are over priced . The horse works great down the slide .	1
The first time my little one played with Disney Princess Klip Klops was at a friends house . There was so much enjoyment on her face , that I decided I would purchase one and see if she would still enjoy playing with it at home . She did ! Now , I 'm hoping to get her the Disney Princess Klip Klop Palace for her Birthday . I would definitely purchase again and recommend to others .	1
My triplet granddaughters love these ! They got the castle for Christmas and they each have their own princess and prince or knight . Even the adults enjoy putting them at the tops of their ramps and watching them & # 34 ; klip klop & # 34 ; down . They 're just simple , cute and fun ( and no batteries ! )	1
We have all of the accessory ponies to go with our Klip Klop Pony set . They are all the same quality and look so cute going down the ladders . Love Little People and especially that they are princesses !	1
An excellent add-on to the kilpklop stable . My two year old granddaughter also brings this along in the car to play .	1
Shes just too cute . Whats even better is when Belle & Phillip go down the ramp , He makes Klip Klop noises ! ! I thought that was just ADORABLE . I recommend this for anyone who loves Little people & Beauty and the Beast . c :	1
We thoroughly enjoy these Fisher-Price Little People Disney Klip Klop 's . No complaints , and so much fun for YOUR little people to use .	1
My daughter just turned 1 and absolutely loves this toy with the stable and cottage ! She loves it and it is easy for her to use .	1
I like this product a lot . Since we do n't have the whole stable , I was n't sure how I 'd like this little set , but I think it 's great . The horse does get & # 34 ; stuck & # 34 ; sometimes and you just to have to tap it a little to get it started again .	1
We love all the klip-klop figures . Lots of fun . Would recommend them to everyone . Thanks so much for this item .	1
I 've purchased the stables for my daughter but she wo n't receive it until Santa drops it off . So I thought I 'd just get her the single pack to test out until then . I was worried she would become bored with it very easy but she loves it and is still amazed by it 2 weeks later . She 's played with this toy every day since we brought it home from the store . That 's very rare for a 2 year old in my opinion . She even took it outside while playing we were playing with the neighbors and everyone wanted a turn with it , even the 10 year old boys ! I was shocked kids like it so much . I 'm relieved to know she 'll enjoy the big stable on Christmas morning . I picked Belle since the stable comes with two blonde princesses and I like some variety in her toys . I 'll probably pick Ariel up also.I would have purchased more at the time if I had known these could be stacked to make a longer ramp with two of them . I was n't aware of this until I opened the package at home . I 've seen Jasmine on the Fisher Price website but have had no luck locating her for actual sale . I 'm also disappointed Tiana , Snow White and Merida are n't available . Maybe they will expand the line if the product does well . Also , I seen some video reviews of this and the horses seemed a little hard to manipulate . I was worried if an adult was having problems , my child might not be able to make it function correctly but she has no problem and knows exactly what to do to get the horse going .	1
My girls loved that this matched the Disney Belle character from the movie and it worked perfect with their stable . They all easily make the horses klip klop down the ramp for hours of fun .	1
Good stocking stuffer . Love the klip klop princesses . These extra pieces hook together . I only wish they could hook onto the stable somewhere for extra play area .	1
absolutely love this ! ! ! my daughter squealed when she opened it and has been playing with it nonstop since she opened it	1
Perfect to go with barn . The set only comes with two princesses and everyone knows you have to have more than that ! Not seeing them in stores .	1
I bought this to go with the Klip Klop stable for my granddaughter for Christmas . She really likes it . I do n't think it would be nearly as fun if was n't used with the stable . It 's a cute toy , and she 's had a lot of fun with it .	1
My girls love the klip klop princesses and castles . they are 3 1/2 and 17 months . I like that the ramps connect to each other .	1
Glad we got a 3 pack of these as one is n't much fun for my little one . They are quick to put together and take apart .	1
This was purchased for my grandaughter for Christmas , her parents got her the stable and told me that she was going to need items to go with it .	1
The Klip Klop Stablle and all the Disney people were a hit with my 3 year old great-granddaughter . She sits and plays with it in the floor the whole day . Every horse and princess is her favorite .	1
I liked the quality of the toy , the detail of the concept of the Market , again will fit with the other sets . I would recommend to purchased for any toddler .	1
Bought this for my grandchildren . They love all the scenarios they can come up with , with all the pieces . Seems like a sturdy toy . I did buy extra people for more imaginative play .	1
Arrived on time . Excellent Christmas gift . We all remember little people farm house , this toy seems to be as big a hit with the little ones .	1
This is the 9th or 10th Little people toys that I have purchased and my Grand Daughter loves them all . I boughtthis one as a Christmas gift and I know she will love it .	1
I purchased this item because my son loves little people and for the add on price of $ 4 I could n't go wrong it comes with a figure , shopping cart , checkout , food stand , food , and the market it connects to any other lp sets you have he 's had hrs of fun with it already	1
Cute little pretend play toy that helps us discuss what is expected at the store . : ) We also bought the other little people sets !	1
Lots of fun ! My 2yr old lover watering the flowers and playing garden . Especially since my husband has a real veggie garden of his own : )	1
The grandkids loved it , fits right in with the other Little People playsets.Good quality , great detail , nice price and can be passed on to the younger ones	1
Got this for my 17 month old granddaughter for Christmas and she likes it . Quality toy that I think will last for the next one coming too . What made it even better was the great sale price I got it for .	1
This is a very colorful play-set with a lot more detail/actions than I had expected . The windmill can be taken in or out ( easily ) and spins beautifully . There 's a little worm that pops out of the apple barrel when you insert it in any of the slots where it fits ( there are two in the farm stand and in the garden area , to swap in and out ) . It 's really cute how the little veggies `` grow '' /pop out of the ground -- and when you pump the water pump , the sunflower section slowly pops up ( in three increments , with each pump ) . I think the Little People figure who comes with the set is absolutely adorable ( and I like it that she could really be of any race/ethnicity ) . Great great toy . My almost 3 year old loves it , but I wish it had been available when she was around 1.5 , as I feel 1.5-2.5 would probably have been the best time for this toy .	1
This is a very cute product ! It helps the little ones with cause and effect as well as with fine motor skills . They can pump the water which makes the flowers grow . The one thing I disliked was when you flip the vegetables the panels do n't stay flipped . I think if it were more like a switch that would flip them over then switch it back to put it down that would be better . There is nothing that will get ruined by chewing on it and it does give kids and early idea of a garden .	1
I got this to put next to the Little People Happy Sounds Home and my 21 month old daughter loves it ! The set comes with a girl , a pop up worm , windmill , farm stand , lettuce , carrots , buttons to pop up the veggies in the ground , a watering pump , and a hose to & # 34 ; water & # 34 ; the garden . She loves the worm that when you sit him on one of the sections for the veggies in the farm stand , he pops up from the apples . I love that the set is interactive in that you can push the water pump and the sunflowers pop up in 3 increments and when pushed again , they go down , she can & # 34 ; water & # 34 ; the veggies and see them pop up , spin the windmill , and she can pretend to run the farm stand . I also like that the buttons and water pump teach cause and effect to the child and also helps teach the process of how food grows in the garden.My only very minor complaint about this set is that sometimes the 3 buttons to pop up the veggies gets stuck . I do wish that when you press the buttons that the veggies stayed up because as soon as you let the button go , they go back down . But we love this set and it makes a great addition to our Little People village !	1
My oldest ( who is 12 now ) and I loved to play with sets for hours on end ! The toy itself is still amazing . Maybe a little too simple in the sense that you ca n't move the hose a lot and the pieces in the middle do n't stay up , which I think they should . My four year old ( the one whom this toy was purchased for ) was completely unimpressed . I do n't know if it 's just because times in interests are so different with kids these days or if she is just too old already for them but she hardly ever gets them out to play with the set , even if I beg her and play with her with the set : ( . I thought it would be a great imaginative play set but she would rather play with other things .	1
Fisher-Price totally gets it . I always remember their toys being in my family as a kid . I trust them and enjoy the variety of ideas .	1
This is a very interactive toy . Everything you touch or move does something . My Grand daughter loves itand it is one of her favorite Little People toys . It was the last one I bought and I wish it was the first one .	1
This play set is great to go with the Happy House so they have a play set for outside the House . I bought this since the Happy House only came with Dad , Mom and Baby and I needed a Lil Sister ! !	1
Fisher Price toys are a must-buy for any birthday or holiday gift . These toys are awesome and they are easy to play with , as well as really fun . I have bought almost all of the toy sets for my 3 year old and she is sure to love them come Christmas morning !	1
We have a couple of little people play sets and my kids never really got into them . I was reluctant to purchase this one but I really wanted it because it was sooo cute . I went ahead and got it and I am glad I did . My kids all fight over it . It has all the components of an actual playground and it is a great toy for helping young kids explore their imaginations . Would recommend for little people lovers and non-lovers alike .	1
This item was purchased as a Christmas gift for a great-niece . Her face lit up when she saw it ! She loves to play on the swing and slide at her grandma 's house and will enjoy playing with this set when she ca n't be outdoors . It makes me want to play too ! Very colorful and I like the durability and reputation of Fisher Price toys . Will allow for hours of imaginitive play .	1
Great gift for grandchildren . Just bought it for my grandson who is 20 months old.. He loves playing with it . Would recommend it .	1
Perfect addition to my granddaughters little people sets !	1
Our kids love playing with this park . The house and barn make sounds , the playground does n't . The kids love pushing the buttons on the house and barn ... but when they play with this they actually PLAY with it .	1
We have the Little People Sweet Sounds Home and the garden set and when I saw this , we had to have it . The set comes with a boy , a girl , a bench link , and the 1 piece playground which features a slide , a swing , a seesaw , a sandbox , and a climbing rope on the other side . My daughter loves putting the people on the slide and the swing the most and I love how bright and colorful the set is , as well as that the playground activities are the same ones we have at our neighborhood playground , which makes it more realistic and relateable to her . It gets lots of use ! I 'm giving it 4 stars for these reasons : The Little People figures that are coming out lately are slimmer than the older versions of the figures and while many of the play sets and cars can fit both the newer and older versions of the figures on the knobs , this one does NOT , so I was disappointed about that . I was also disappointed in the fact that you have to press the figures onto the seesaw and swing with a lot of force to make them stay on the equipment without falling over and my 21 month old daughter does get frustrated with that and has to ask for help . Finally , the flag that comes on it is very cheaply made and falls off very easily . It was such cheap plastic that it 's already bent . I 'd still recommend this set though because it is a lot of fun !	1
Arrived on time , packaged well . We all remember the Little People farm house , this toy is as a big a hit with the little ones .	1
My granddaughter loves this set . It 's part of her Little People neighborhood ( along with the house , farm , and airport ) . All other Little People figures fit on the swing and seesaw .	1
Our son has all of the little people farm sets . This was a great addition to our small world play . It 's wonderful because he thinks the duck is supposed to be off flying and the pond is for the pig 's bath time . Perfect for imaginative play .	1
cute toy , came quick , child loved it , made good Christmas gift and added to child 's farm set well and made her very happy	1
My 18 month old son loved this . Especially the diving broad which makes a funny noise and you hit it .	1
My son has the entire farm collection and he loves it . When we travel , I stick this part into my bag and it can easily be played with in minimal space such as a tray table on a plane . My son really enjoys the noise the diving board makes . It would be nice if the toy had more parts that made noise to make it a bit more interesting . But as an addition to the farm set - it is a nice one and I would definitely recommend .	1
My 20 month old loves this toy ! He loves that he can make the duck & # 34 ; jump & # 34 ; off the spring board ! He plays with it along side his barn ! I would definitely recommend this !	1
My 2 yr old is loving this addition to the farm he got for Christmas ! He has fun going to the park and seeing the geese and ducks , then coming home to play with his own little pond . He thinks it 's pretty funny to put the pig on the roof too . I like that it came with one fence panel to connect with the farm and garden but I really wish I could buy more fence panels as my son loves connecting them .	1
goes perfect with the farm and tractor . my 2 year old always want to play with her farm . the springboard on the log makes fun noises for the kids	1
It 's cute , my son loves to play with it but does get aggravated with the boxes when he ca n't put them in the cart . The fencing connects to the barn fencing . Personally the new fencing design is bad . The older ones were much better because they hooked together in the middle and were so much more secure . These new fencing hooks at the bottom , does n't really clip , and always falls apart with any little movement . This sends my son into a tantrum so I 've taken the fences away from him .	1
You just ca n't beat Fisher-Price , my grandchildren are still playing with some pieces that were their parents from 35 years ago . My son had the F-P farm years ago and this is the newer version of the tractor and wagon . Very cute and of course safe for a toddler . My great nephew lit up upon opening it .	1
This has been a great toy for my 2 year old . He loves using it with his new little people farm .	1
it is super adorable . my 2 yr old loves it . the animals inside the vegetable crates move up and down when the wheels of the tractor turn .	1
Ca n't go wrong with these toys . I have bought many many sets of them and my Grand Daughter who is 2 yrs old lovesthem all . It is cool to see her play by herself . I caught her kissing the figures the other day . She loves playing with them .	1
I had bought my 3 year old the Fisher Price Happy Sounds Home , as well as the Fisher Price Lil ' Movers School Bus , so this buy was a no-brainer . These toys are wonderfully made , and will last through years of play as well as pretty much anything else !	1
Fisher Price is wonderful with their little people and accessories . We got our grandbabies the house and the barn and plan on keeping it going for birthdays and holidays . The little people accessories work awesome !	1
I purchased this item as a gift for my niece . She has the FP house play set and this will go nicely with it . It is so cute that I plan to buy one for my granddaughter as well . I have been a huge fan of Fisher Price toys since my own kids were babies ( now in their 30s ) . This set will give many hours of fun and imaginitive play on its own or as an add-on to the house playset .	1
It 's FP , it 's Little people , made with quality and granddaughter loved it . Went well with all the other pieces I bought for her and I 'm sure will last so the one on the way will be able to enjoy it also , be it girl or boy . ; 0 )	1
my daughter loves her little people ... .this set came with the several parts which made it a good value , as well as the dog	1
I gave this product a five star because it was exactly what my granddaughter wanted and it was priced right . I recommend this product to all . Made well and kids love it	1
Goes perfectly with the Little Peoples Happy Sounds Home . Imagination and dexterity encouraged in using all the parts of the toy .	1
Our daughter received this from Santa along with the house and playground . She is 1 and our son is 2 . They both love it and our son will only let the girl drive the bike because she is the only one with a helmet on	1
Bought this for my 2 year old for Christmas to go with her Little People Happy Sounds Home and other playsets and she really loves it . In the set you get a little girl and her dog , as well as the tricycle and detachable wagon and a little snap on extension . All of the pieces are high quality and durable and have withstood being dropped from the highchair numerous times.I love that the bike is detachable from the wagon so you can use them independently of each other . Even though Fisher Price has switched to `` slimmer '' Little People , I love that most of the older Little People figures can fit on the pegs so you can vary who rides the wagon/bike to add more play options to this . The bike/wagon both ride smoothly even across carpet and the wagon handles turns very well . To be honest , I do n't think the yellow extension is really useful so we do n't use that , but we love this set !	1
Adorable ! The wagon attaches to the trike with ease . A little one might need a little practice , but definitely achievable . The dog is the cutest dog from the Little People collection thus far !	1
I am surprised by how well the tricycle and wagon stay connected and roll on hard surfaces ! You can load the vehicle and wagon with characters and push them off on a wooden floor and they will roll smoothly for a nice bit . No jack-knifing of the wagon because of the design . No disconnects from the tricycle . The vehicle is well-balanced , so it never topples -- even when your little one pushes it a bit hard . The trike and wagon are tough and can take a beating without bending or breaking.Great toy . If your kids love Little People , this is one to buy . The dog is very cute and detailed well , like a cartoon . The little ice cream stand impressed my kids more than I thought it would . The little girl , who you may have from other sets , is dressed differently and fits in well as an alternate or & # 34 ; twin & # 34 ; sister or something . : ) Great quality . Facilitates fun play times . Worth buying .	1
My 5 yr old daughter has wanted a doll that did ` everything ' and I think this one is as close as it can get . This doll does what the typical doll does by saying various cutesy phrases , sucking on bottles/pacis , laughing , etc. , but what sets this doll apart from others is that this doll takes it a step farther ... she really can be ` fed ' and ` soil ' diapers . The doll does everything ; I think the only thing I have yet to hear it do is cry - which is a sound I could forego.The doll does not come with volume control , but it is not overly loud or annoying . It encourages nurturing and parenting and it 's not just for girls , even my nearly 7yr old son joined in on the feeding fun but when it came to the diaper change , he was n't having it ( *grin ) .The only thing I would change would be the dolls size . I think the doll seems bulky and not baby-like . The dolls eyes are too big and it does n't make for a great cuddle companion . However , with that said , my daughter really seems to like this doll above her others . She gives it plenty of kisses and it makes her laugh , so for that I give it two thumbs up and would recommend it . Just be prepared to buy more food and diapers . *As an Amazon Vine Member i review this item just as I would if I had purchased it .	1

When I saw one available , I knew I had to get it for my niece . The manufacturer says Baby Alive is for ages 3 and up . My niece is 3 and she loves the baby but does n't appreciate all the 'extra ' things Baby Alive can do .	1
My daughter has been obsessed with babies . So much so , she 's bugging me to have another child but um , NO ! I am not doing it ! One is enough ! Haha.She has been playing with a Baby Alive doll at therapy ( occupational and speech therapies ) sessions and really loves taking care of her . So the chance to test one out at home was a perfect opportunity ! Let me preface my review with this information ( it may be important to some consumers ) , my daughter is 10 but she has a severe traumatic brain injury which ( besides other issues ) caused her to have a hemiplegia ( one sided weakness . For her , the left side ) and she does n't use her left arm . So , most things are one handed.This doll is the perfect size and weight for her . She loves cradling her , feeding her but darn it ! She does n't want to clean up her mess ! Ugh ! I have to do it ( which you really , really need to maintain it or you can ruin the doll ) . She gets a kick out of the baby 's accidents.She 's been having a blast and the doll is super cute !	1
First things first : The `` real surprises '' in the name refer to the doll 's ability to simulate eating and then pooping . I have no idea why a kid would want this extra work , but my little niece loves it . It helps that the doll looks just like her.The doll is a little bigger than I thought she would be , but that 's a good thing . Also , as mentioned in other reviews , she 's kind of loud . But she has a good repertoire of sayings and such and everyone who has seen it thinks the doll is `` very cute . `` The refill pack for diapers and food is available here at Amazon . It contains 10 diapers , 10 food packs and 10 juices . It currently runs around $ 20 , which seems like a lot to me . If you 're a parent who wants to avoid having to buy the pack , know that the doll is great without using the feed/poop features -- but given the doll talks about feeding and such , your little one might insist on experiencing the doll 's gastrointestinal wonders . And that might get expensive fast . Also , you 'll be the one cleaning the toy after feedings , so that 's another thing to consider.All in all , if your child wants a cute doll with good animatronics and realistic feeding behaviors , this is a great choice . But make sure you know what you 're getting into .	1
House is adorable but that is where my praise ends . The floor is cardboard ... .I have never hard another Mattel or Disney toy that was cardboard.Sofia 's head popping off is terrifying to my daughter . It has happened about 30 times today.The clover hide and seek is a complete failure . He is too big to disappear in the compartment.I spent 250 dollars on the sofia castle and all the toys and extras that go with it . We have the loving family dollhouse which far exceeds this castle . I am 100 % disappointed .	-1
I purchased this toy at Wal*Mart yesterday ( it 's $ 5 cheaper ) for my daughter 's birthday today . She turned 3 and is a huge Sofia fan , so I grabbed this , the royal family , and the animal friends . My husband put the castle together last night as I decorated and wrapped , and I instantly fell in love . It 's quite a bit sturdier than other castles we 've owned , Sofia says many cute phrases , and the extra accessories are nice additions.Upon waking up , the castle had a mind of it 's own . While the Sofia and Amber dolls both activate their own voices , James & The King activate Sofia 's , and the mom & Clover activate nothing at all . The Sofia 's doll head very easily pops off , but so far has only happened once when I was taking it out of the package ( for the animal friends , but all of the Sofia 's are built the same ) . Of course , the voices work only when they want to which is about 25 % of the time . There is a button to press on the voice box that tells it to wake up and talk -- -most of the time , I have to physically pull the voice box out of the castle , turn the switch from on to off back to on , and snap it back in for it to respond.Overall , it 's a very cute castle , it 's well made and seems sturdy . The accessories are cute , but the voice box is a hot mess ! I 'm still on the fence about keeping it . For $ 54.98 ( or $ 60 depends on where you shop ) it should work ! So , buyer beware -- -if you want just the castle , great ... if you expect the voices to work ? You 'll be sorely disappointed .	-1
Our castle finally came in , the girls have been SO EXCITED waiting for the release date and we 've just been opening the box anxious to get it put together . And we realized the only figurine it comes with is Sophia . I see now the description does say this , but I did n't notice . For what we paid it should have all the figurines in my opinion , and it feels flimsy . Honestly if we had n't trashed the box opening it I would send this toy back . But ... instead I 'll order the extra pieces and just be annoyed . We have n't finished putting the castle together to be able to review that . I sure wish there had been reviews before I ordered this toy , but it was a pre order . The Sophia doll is really cute , but I read now that we will probably have issues with the head popping off . I sure hate to order the rest of the royal family knowing all this , but the girls thought they were getting them already so I have to do it . Grrrr ... wish this had been a better toy .	-1
Original review below . I wanted to post to all those disappointed with the first castle release that there are replacement parts for the castle now . Mattel will send you a Sofia ( whose head stays in tack ) , a staircase ( that does n't fall off easy ) , a talking box ( Roland and Miranda play royal entrance music , Amber talks , Clover still touchy , others say Sofia voiced phrases but that have to do more with their character ) , and some small parts that may get lost that come with castle . They will also send you a Sofia and Amber doll from Royal family collection . Overall , I 'm happier with the product now . And my daughter is thrilled that not everyone speaks in Sofia 's voice and that the heads stay on . To new purchasers - I 'm not sure what version Amazon is selling . Best to check the stores and get the newest release ( the new one has a plastic 2nd floor ) .orig post.This is a product that I really wish would have been on the AMAZON VINE program and had some reviews before the `` preorder '' was available . My daughter ( 3 years old ) has been so excited for this toy to arrive at our home since I showed it to her when I first preordered it ( her birthday was in May and it was to be a birthday gift , why I showed it to her ) . She plays daily with her Fisher Price Loving Family Dollhouse ( everyday since Christmas ) , and I knew a Sofia castle would be amazing to her and a toy that would get alot of use.My honest advice . If your child does not know about this toy and you are merely trying to use this as a gift , do n't bother . Your life will be much happier without this toy . Buy a Loving Family Dollhouse..I give that toy 5 stars . If your child knows about this toy and is asking for it , purchase at your own risk , you have been warned.Pros : - I think it 's decently sturdy and easy to put together ( minus the paper flooring on the second floor ) - It 's cuteCons : ( pretty much what everyone else has hit on ) - Sofia 's head popped off 3 times today ( `` Mommy , uh oh ... .her head came off ... waaahhhhhhh '' ) - Clover does n't actually fit in securely in the little `` hide go seek '' window seat ... he falls in to the hole ( `` mommy ... .waaahhh '' ) - Out of about 20 tries , Clover 's voice worked exactly once.- I fear for the destruction of the paper floor on the second floor.I would totally return it if she did n't desire to play with it , but she played through the frustration all day . I also fear for the arrival of the Royal Family to our home in a few days . I understand that the characters do n't speak correctly either , that King Roland and Prince James do n't stand at all , and that they heads pop off the characters as well.Mattel - Please test your products before producing . Seriously . I knew this toy was in production since before Christmas , you have had plenty of time to show it to a small panel of kids and watch them play with it . This is the third toy we have purchased/received in a month with horrible construction from Mattel ( specifically this toy , the barbie dream pool , and the Disney Princess MagicClip Aurora Carriage ) .Disney - Make your own toys . You are getting a horrible name by relating yourselves to these products .	-1
Feels flimsy all the way ! The stais will not stay put , they fall all the time . Also I was expecting each family member ( we also purchased the Royal Family Giftset and the Royal bed ) to say a phrase in their voice and we never heard the father or the brother talking . The queen says a phrase every once in a blue moon , and no matter which character you place on the talking spot phrases are random . Sometimes you hear Clover , most of the time Sofia and once or twice the sister and the mother . Be ready to reassemble it many times , windows , doors and the pointy castle peaks fall apart all the time .	-1
My daughter is a huge Sofia fan . This Sofia toy is such a let down . I pre-ordered this and truly wanted to love it.The castle takes way longer than expected to assemble . I did n't even care because I was so excited for my daughter . But after that , the entire thing immediately feels flimsy . The stairs have come off so often that we have thrown them out . The dolls heads come off so often that it is a choking hazard to play with around younger siblings . And the voices do n't even match all the time . It 's a head-scratchingly poor product..One would think that ( a ) a Disney associated product and ( b ) a toy for toddlers would be much better designed ! Does anyone even test these toys with a live toddler before releasing ? Overall : Disappointed .	-1
This castle was well thought out in terms of content -- it has so many pretty details : scrollwork doors , stairs , balcony and windows , a pullout garden with a footbridge , cute miniature castle for Sofia to play with and and a hanging chandelier . In the picture - all of these details really shine . But when you get it out of the box there are many glaring problems:1 . The floors are made of almost paper thin cardboard . Not only do the dolls have a hard time staying upright but there 's no way that this will last 5 minutes with the 3-6yr old crowd . I was pretty shocked to see cardboard at this price point.2 . The plastic is used to construct this castle is flimsy -- think happy meal toy.3 . Because the plastic is flimsy , when you put the toy together you are constantly worried you will break it because it goes together by pushing the plastic into the corresponding slots.4 . Some pieces are TINY . There are tiny plates and goblets that fit inside the length of a dime . They warn customers about this on the box but I might think twice about giving them to a 3 year old.5 . The dolls head swivels and is held together with a ball and socket that is fragile . Like the cardboard issue , I ca n't imagine that the head with stay on for long -- especially with younger kids.6 . The doors and windows pop out easily and the staircase wobbles and is awkward.Overall , once together , this castle is FRAGILE . If your child dropped it , the plastic might break , and at the very least the turrets and windows would pop off . We also have a little people castle from Fisher Price that take ALOT of abuse that is nowhere near as pretty but is much more durable , sturdy and more expensive looking with no cardboard . If you have a young child , but that one and get the Disney Store made Sofia play figurines for them to use with the FP castle.Those with older kids , you may have a fighting chance but you will be majorly disappointed by what you get for your money.I do n't recommend this product at all and it 's a shame because its such a great franchise .	-1
Just as other reviewers stated , these dolls do not stand up and the heads often come off . I 'm sick of seeing these decapitated dolls . Skip this !	-1
The dolls can not sit on chairs unless the chairs are supported by some type of wall . Without a backing the dolls fall off .	-1
My daughter is a huge Sofia fan . This Sofia toy is such a let down.The plastic figurines do n't even sit on the chairs without falling off ( let alone stand ) . Their heads also continually fall off . One would think that ( a ) a Disney product and ( b ) a toy for toddlers would be much better designed ! Disappointed .	-1
I just bought this toy from target and the heads keeps coming off , they snap back in but fall right off again , my daughter LOVES sofia but is n't interested in this toy at all cause of how annoying it is and she 's only 3. it seems like all the sofia toys were rushed and just not made durable at all .	-1
If it were n't for the fact that my daughter had already laid eyes on this Sofia she received as a gift , I probably would have returned it . For what 's supposed to be a toddler toy , it has shockingly small pieces . I thought some of her other toys accessories were small , but these are ridiculous . Worse of all , the lid of the trunk and the blanket are constantly falling off and need to be reattached . I guess the head popping off issue other reviewers have mentioned has been fixed , but the rest of it is not worth the hassle . Since we have a mobile baby in the house , this toy has been banished to her older sisters room , never to be circulated with the safer and more age appropriate toys .	-1
Bed breaks every 2 minutes , the trunk too . Its sad because its a CUTE set . Absolutely NOT worth the $ 19 I paid for it , but my daughter loves it so I keep fixing it every couple minutes . Very frustrating .	-1
Are you kidding me ? What a shame that this is supposed to go with the castle and it barely fits . Completely disappointed .	-1
The castle was 60 dollars the family was another 39 dollars , so basically a hundred dollars.The castle broke the second day and is irreparable.The heads pop off the dolls , the boy dolls will stand , momentarily , the castle has a sound board where you press the feet of the dolls and you get sentences or music , depending on the doll.The dolls are not anywhere near being worth 8 bucks apiece and Disney has made this deal so every time you order one thing your kiddo is going to want something else because the pieces are sold in such a way that demands you buy something else to have what you need to make the toy a set that is fun to play with . What a rip off and a cheaply made rip off on top of that . With aprox . 99 dollars invested I have a doll house now in the trash and a set of poorly made overpriced dolls , I salvaged the platform that takes four triple A batteries so my kiddos can at least have that much . Basically money in the trash and very unhappy grand daughters .	-1
Not one single character works in the castle . And the amber doll will not sit like sofia and James . King Roland can not stand on his own .	-1
Well my daughter was so super happy to receive this toy , more so than most of her others . But every single one of their heads have popped off . Now they can go back on , but the unavoidable has happen , the heads have been lost , now we have a kind of macabre first family ... Not quite so fun any more , especially for the money ...	-1
The basic design of the dolls are n't bad , but the actual play value of them is lost in that design . Sofia and Amber 's heads are very easy to pop off and while ours have n't popped off several times , it 's only been a day . Like other reviews have mentioned , the only doll that can stand on her own is the Queen Mother , while the King and James topple over with the design . The point of this design is that their voices will work on the soundbox of the castle you can also buy ... big mistake . If they activate voices at all , it 's only Sofia 's voice . I paid $ 24.98 at Wal*Mart on this and it 's maybe worth $ 10 at the absolute most .	-1
You need these to play with the talking castle but dont expect to hear all of them . I feel the `` phrase unlocking '' is a marketing scheme ! We were expecting each family member ( we also purchased the Royal Family Giftset and the Royalbed ) to say a phrase in their voice and we never heard the father or the brother talking . The queen says a phrase every once in a blue moon , and no matter which character you place on the talking spot phrases are random by random characters . Sometimes you hear Clover , most of the time Sofia and once or twice the sister and the mother . We have never heard the brother or the father . Also dolls head fall apart easily and you will be asked over and over to put them back together .	-1
My daughter is a huge Sofia fan . These Sofia toys are such a let down . I really wanted to love them.The plastic figurines do n't sit/stand/bend by themselves or with the entire optional accessories ( for example , the dolls do n't even fit to sit on the optional horse carriage or at the tea party table ) . Their heads continually fall off to the point it is a hazard for younger siblings ( and pets ) . One would think that ( a ) a Disney product and ( b ) a toy for toddlers would be much better designed ! Disappointed .	-1
i did n't want to buy this as i knew it would be rubbish but also that it would make my daughter happy to open and see on christmas . i was right on both accounts . the figures barely manage to stand up , have to have very steady hands . the faces are a poor likeness to the characters , especially Sophia .	-1
I bought the first set of these and they did n't work ! Amazon as usual was instantly responsive to take them back . I ordered another set for my grand daughter and they did n't work either , just as others have said ( but I did n't listen ) . My daughter in law called Mattel and their customer service said that the base unit must be bad since all voices are the same ! They said they have NO SPARES to replace faulty components so just send everything back to them and they will give her a voucher for other Mattel products . She has a lot of the components including the castle . Unfortunately , the grand daughter has fallen in love with the figures and does n't care that extra money was spent for Chinese technology ( an oxymoron ) that does n't WORK ! So my warning is to not buy unless you want to spend extra for the Chinese kid earning a bowl of rice to screw up the electronics in this piece of crap .	-1
I love Vtech ! When I bought this I was so excited to get it as a great deal ! I got it for my son for Christmas because he already had the Garage and a few of the cars so this was great to add to his collectionWhat is good about the product is the fact that you can buy these play sets and they all can interlock together making a giant set.BUT I CAN NOT figure out what is wrong with this ! We have had it a few months now and have tried all sorts of configurations and the ways the booklet says it can all fit together to no avail.My only guess is that its missing a piece ? oh well..he still loves it..	-1
Not much to this , did not hold a 3 year olds interest for more than a minute ! !	-1
It took up a lot of floor space and since it a high risk item for breaking , we promptly returned it to Amazon . Too bad . Wanted to love it .	-1
I would recommend this for a much younger child into years old and it was very hard to put together and I did n't find my son liked it very much he was too old for this vehicle	-1
My four year old and eight year old broke into this set and had it set up before I could interject any assistance . I really appreciate minimal set up , no fuss packaging , etc ... However , that 's really the only nice thing I can say about this track . Why do I hate this track ? Let me count the ways ... 1 ) Only one car . Who do you race ? 2 ) Really an extension of 1 -- incompatible . This track does n't work with the metal cars toys or the micro drift cars toys or any of the other track sets I have purchased . This is a whole new line requiring trips to the store to purchase competition for the single McQueen car included.3 ) It does n't work consistently . Failure to launch . Failure to make the full length of the track . This is frustrating for the kids and frustrating for me . Even if it 's their favorite franchise , my kids wo n't play with a toy that wo n't work.4 ) The entire set seems to be cheap and made of inferior and warped plastic . This was a surprise , because typically I 've been able to count on Disney products.For my family , this set will probably be recycled quickly . It has n't been used since day one . To say I am disappointed is an understatement .	-1
A family member sent a Wal-Mart gift card for our 3 year old , and he picked this out.Okay , i influenced the choice . It looked pretty cool.I openly admit my engineering skills are horrible , so yeah , it took me awhile to put together . That aside , everyone is right- the stickers ? Just put them on when done . It 's fine.The directions are awful at explaining how to actually play with the thing , but we mostly have it down.1 ) Place the car in the starting position . No , not like that ? Like that ... Wait , nope . Okay , I think we have it now.2 ) Wind up the winder thing until it stops winding . Oops . Waited too long to push the red button . Try again.3 ) Figure out optimal winding speed , push button , and watch in amazement as the car makes figure 8's.. After you move the winner 's circle thing out of the way . Again . Become sidetracked wondering why the clear barrier wo n't stay down until the car gets inside.4 ) Grow bored of bottom track and try upper track.5 ) Pretend that the car is supposed to never make it all the way around . Shout , & # 34 ; Yaaaayyyyyy ! ! ! You did it ! ! ! & # 34 ; and hopefully convince the toddler that this is supposed to happen.6 ) Grab a beer and slowly back away from that $ 30 pile of plastic on the ( uncarpeted ) floor . Retain packaging for possible consignment ? Save your cash . You paid $ 25 for the car and $ 5 for the track . I think when Santa drops off the BluTrack in a few days , we might have a winning combo with the launcher ?	-1
Assembly was no problem - but I have four and six year old kids , so I 've done my share of assembling various toys over the years . The whole design seems not to be very sturdy , and I expect it to last not very long , if my kids would play with it extensively . Which they will not . As described by other reviewers , the stunts do not work reliably , the design is for two cars but there is only one car delivered with the package , and it does not work on carpet . The car would not run very fast , even when Daddy cranked it up to the maximum , and some times it would just get stuck due to lack of momentum . It was more frustration than fun to play with this toy , and it did not help at all that the Cars logo was attached to it - my kids expected more from one their most cherished Disney franchises .	-1
It is so frustrating to get a toy and not be able to put it together the first time . So my kids were never able to enjoy this toy . But this toy does n't seem that fun anyway . It takes too much work for a kid to operate to get Lightning McQueen to zoom around the track . I do not recommend this toy .	-1
This was n't hard to assemble . In theory it should work well . Problem is I have carpeting and I see I 'm not alone in having issues with the lower track working correctly.It 's very frustrating for my sons who are under age 5 . I think there are better track options out there .	-1
The idea of this track is that cars can run on the upper track or on a lower figure eight track . You place the car in the starting area , crank it up , and release it into the track . Since there 's no bottom panel , for the lower figure eight track to work at all , the toy has to be on some sort of hard surface , but it functions properly . The upper track is where we have problems . If the car is wound up enough to actually make it around the circle , it jumps the track every single time . There 's a winner 's circle that is completely manual . You press down a little wall to lock it in place , rotate the part out of the way , and then press a button to pop it into the way of the car so it 's now routed into the circle . First , it 's difficult for a child to time this and , after about three times locking the wall in place , it stopped locking which makes the winner 's circle non-functional . So , overall , all we got out of this toy was a wind up car that runs figure eights on my kitchen table and is probably scratching the finish.As far as assembly , it took maybe 15 minutes and was fairly simple . I do like that the pieces snap tightly into place and stay put , unlike many other tracks . This is good since it will need to be carried up and down the stairs because we do n't have hardwood floors and I want it stored in my son 's room instead of on my kitchen table .	-1
The Disney Cars Stunt Racers Double Decker Speedway could have been a great toy . Kids love the Cars movie so a track that features a way to replicate the movie experience into a playable format should be a great hit right ? Wrong ! The toy proved a bit complicated to assemble though thankfully all the pieces have letters that indicate the sequence in which they fit together . Once you put it together you quickly realize how poorly designed it is . The bottom track requires a hard floor to work properly ( it wont work on carpet ) . The top track has a section that rarely works at all ( the car always seems to get stuck ) . What fun in a racetrack if the car gets stuck in the track ? To make matters worse , the track only comes with one car so the dual launching start gate is totally useless unless you spend extra money on more cars . Overall this had about 20 minutes of playtime for my kids before they became bored and were ready to move on to the next toy . This is not worth the money at all .	-1
Mattel says , `` Kids will love reenacting their favorite scenes from the movies . '' That 's pretty much true , but all the reenacting will be in your child 's imagination and not on this double decker speedway.With rickety plastic construction and instructions that are miles from intuitive , it will be forty minutes before you are ready for the fun . And what fun it will be . Watching your car feebly attempt to navigate the contraption over and over . On the plus side , your child will develop Popeye muscles from cranking the motor incessantly.Amazon 's Recommended Age range is 3 to 7 years . The Manufacturer 's Recommended Age is 3 to 10 years , which is ridiculous . A ten-year-old does not want to play with a dinky car toy . I would say even 7 years is pushing it , if not for the sheer dexterity needed to use this toy . Ultimately , you 'll need TWO children : one to wind it up and one to hold the pieces together for some semblance of functionality , especially the Winner 's Circle . You ca n't even crank sufficiently without moving the launching grid , thus negatively altering the alignment . Forget about seeing `` stunts '' on the track . What a joke.The idiocy of this toy knows no bounds . The stickers , for example . The instructions include this Helpful Hint : `` Apply labels before assembly by number as indicated . '' Unfortunately , the accompanying illustrations show only a fully assembled track . The individual stickers are numbered . The track pieces are lettered . There exists no alphanumeric means of matching which sticker goes on which piece , until *after* assembly is completed , contrary to the stated instructions.From all accounts , the Stunt Racers sets are all disasters : Cars Stunt Racers Dinoco Stunt Show Stunt SetYou can use multiple cars here but of course this set only comes with one . Additional Stunt Racers are ten bucks each . For example , here , here , andhere . At least the car is fun , but forget about the track . Just rev the car ( in either direction ) and place it on a hard floor on an end or a side and watch it go . Just be careful : fingers can get easily caught in the spinning wheels.The images on the box are all Photoshopped , no doubt because Mattel 's engineers could n't get it working long enough to take an actual photograph . If I had paid even twelve bucks for this toy , it would be going back to the store.Shame on you , Mattel .	-1
I have a son who loves the Cars movies , and loves playing with cars of any sort . So I thought this would be a good thing to try.Many people complain about the assembly instructions . I had no problems with them . It 's very clear how it goes together.Others have complained about how flimsy it is , so I was expecting really flimsy . It was n't . Ours holds together just fine . Nothing ever came apart.So assembly was quick and easy , only took a few minutes.Where it 's a fail is in the performance of the toy itself . The lower level track ( only use it on hard floor , this will NOT work on carpet ) actually lets the car do three to five laps around it . There are simply external boundaries for the inner track that force the car to run in a figure 8 underneath the track . That part works fine , the car just pushes against the plastic guide on the outside and that forces it to go where it should , there 's no `` track '' on the bottom . But the top track , the one that has the `` Winner 's Circle '' and everything , is a complete disaster . Even with me cranking it as fast as it will go , the car *sometimes* can complete a single lap up there . More often than not , the `` trick '' parts of the track screw things up and the car stops there ... The winners circle part has a spring inside that snaps it into place onto the track when you decide the race is over and press on the Piston Cup up there . Until that point it 's rotated so as to not interfere with the race . Press the Piston Cup , the spring rotates it into place so it can capture the car . There 's a small clear plastic piece that then pops up so the car finishes out the remainder of it 's energy spinning around in it . That part works fine , but the odds on the car having any energy left to make it that far even on the first lap are poor ... If you have correctly sized cars that can sit in the `` observation area '' , when the car spins in the winners circle , that makes little pieces of the track under the spectators move , so that it looks like they 're moving up and down cheering . My son would 've been more impressed had they simply had a plastic piece with a sticker of people that moved up and down since at least that would work more consistently.All in all , a fail on the upper track , even if the lower track works alright . Definitely not worth the purchase . The lower track is the only reason it even gets two stars . If it were just the top track that was part of the race here , I would 've given one star .	-1
I remember playing with Matchbox cars and generic plastic tracks back in the 80s ( everything was universal back in those days ) and felt somewhat nostalgic when I had the opportunity to review the latest entry from the Disney Merchandising Empire , namely the Cars Speedway . Course I , a 6'5 29 year old male with graying hair , would have looked REALLY silly to my roommates trying to test this product by myself so I , as I had done with previous reviews on toys , enlisted the help of my neighbors , who have two children between the ages of 7-10 ( I did n't ask , silly me ) to test it out while I took notes nearby . It did n't take long for problems to occur starting with assembly.The instructions were ... well ... crappy and exceedingly vague for anyone that does n't assemble anything on a daily basis . The mother , who is about as normal as blueberry pie ( hehe , South Pacific reference ! ) , called me over within five minutes expressing frustration at what the instructions meant . The pictures were somewhat confusing even to me , and I used to install home theaters and home appliances at Best Buy . I had to violate my own prime directive of reviewing non-interference to assist the mother in construction and I quickly quipped that I certainly hope the writers of the manuals do not moonlight as 911 Operators ( `` Perform CPR by using your hands ! `` ) Even with my help , it took approximately 30 minutes to assembly what should 've have been a 10-minute job and we came to an even worse realization after that.Now , I 'm not a parent but I 've moved around enough and spent enough time at other friend 's houses as a child to know that most children 's rooms are carpeted . It 's a safety and comfort issue . Now , where does this fit into my review ? Well , the product is basically a two-level track that starts on the bottom floor , that sits on the ground , and the cars are shot by a launcher up a ramp to the upper level or around a loop on the ground level . Problem is that the ground floor is little more than a plastic perimeter/guardrail that guides the cars and NOT an actual track . Also , there 's a few inches of space between the launcher and the ramp to the upper level , meaning the car has to traverse across whatever surface it 's sitting on ( hardwood , carpet , your Dad 's back , etc . ) before using the remaining momentum to ascend.In short , this thing does NOT work on carpet , ergo use in the vast majority of children 's rooms.Now , I was always under the impression that Disney had one of the best marketing divisions in the world , and yet , they overlooked THIS little problem that even I , a non-parent , figured out almost immediately ( Hey , Disney Toy Execs ! Did I mention that I am available to hire as a full-time bonafide toy tester ? *waggles eyebrows sarcastically* ) .The mother and I quickly relocated the speedway , which almost fell apart in our hands as it is very flimsy , to the kitchen table after promptly evicting the father , who was trying to enjoy a quiet game of Angry Birds on his laptop . After explaining the importance of testing the product to the angry father ( `` It 's for science ! '' ) we reassembled the tracks and were about to test it on the hard surface of the table with the kids when we ran into another problem.I handed the Steve- er ... Lightning McQueen car to the youngest and reached into grab another one for the other- ... what the ? Where 's the other car ? The Speedway only comes with one car and replacement cars cost ... well ... you can get a few Matchbox cars for the same price . This was n't good as you ca n't have a race without two cars otherwise it 's a time trial and this is hardly Mario Kart . After a few seconds of thinking I asked the kids if they had any Matchbox cars to see if they could be used as substitutes . It was here that I found out WHY the Cars Stunt Racers were so expensive ; they 're proprietary and have pull-back motors ! This means they are specifically designed for the track and vice versa so nothing else will work on the track as we learned VERY quickly.I see your tricks Disney Toy Execs ! You clever fatherless people you ! THIS is how they tie you in to buy more stuff that is way overpriced and as flimsy as a bridge on the I-5 ! Seeing how this was not going to work with two children and I was NOT going to travel to the nearest department store to spend money on more cars , we let the children take turns and they got bored within minutes as there was nothing more to do than turn an annoying crank and watch a single car do the same thing every time . It became very repetitive and I can just imagine how long the flimsy power crank would last as it sounded like something from Frankenstein with every passing turn.Realizing that this toy would not last without a larger investment in more Disney Cars toys , I turned to the mother and asked a single question.Me : `` Do you guys have a Nintendo Wii ? `` Mother : `` Yes . `` Me : `` Mario Kart ? `` Mother : `` Of course ! `` Me : `` I challenge all of you ! `` Kids : `` Challenge accepted ! `` I lost ... darn kids ... All in all , this product is little more than an attempt by what I can only imagine as a bunch of pudgy , balding Disney Toy Execs to suck you in and buy more stuff . This toy is annoying to assemble , flimsy at best , and requires a larger investment to even begin to enjoy . Avoid .	-1
This track gets two stars from me because my son does think it 's cool ( he 's almost four and likes Cars , ) he likes the car itself , and because we ( adults ) have gotten at least some of the functionality to work some of the time . However , he 's never actually gotten it to work himself , so that I 'm surprised he was n't more disappointed . He 's mostly ignored the track after the first 24 hours and played with just the car.Putting the track together was n't impossible , but it was a challenge and the instructions were n't all that clear . ( `` Helpful hint '' to put on the stickers first would have been ridiculously hard . ) It holds together well enough to work , but tends to start coming apart quickly if it 's moved or if baby brother comes along.It was tough for me as a mom to figure out how to set up and use it ; the instructions offer practically no guidance as to what it 's supposed to do and how . My husband 's the only one out of the three of us that 's really gotten the car to loop the track . In fact , now that I look at other reviews , there are things I did n't even know it was supposed to do.One potential problem is that it has to be used on a hard , smooth surface - at the lower level the car runs on the floor rather than a track . Carpet , rug or probably tile would be problematic.A final drawback I see is that it 's a track to RACE cars , and of course only one car is included . To have a race you 'll need to pick up another vehicle in the set , likeDisney / Pixar CARS Stunt Racers Raoul CaRouleIt 's designed to launch two cars at once , though you can do just one.Amazon 's description says that it 's based off the movie Planes . Having seen Cars but not Planes , I really think it 's based on Cars ; the car included is Lightning McQueen .	-1
I liked the concept of this toy because it looked like it would offer my test kidlets a number of different play choices , but the reality turned out somewhat different.First of all , this toy MUST be played on non-carpeted surfaces . To use the `` bottom '' level of the track , you need to have a hard surface otherwise the car wo n't be able to make a circuit of the inner course . Also , since the launcher is not attached to the device ( so you can change the angle of entry ) a hard surface is also needed to reach the upper course levels.Second complaint , only one race car is provided with the toy . It 's hard to have a `` race '' when there 's no one to race against , and you ca n't substitute any Hot Wheels or Matchbox cars that you might have on hand.Third complaint , the assembly instructions were not very clear and the letter-marks on the pieces were sometimes hard to see/find . This is n't something that the kids can put together themselves.We never did ever get the car to run completely around the upper tracks , though it did make a nice figure-8 on the floor-level track . We just could n't get it to go fast enough to fully test the course.My recommendation ? Save your money . There are better toys out there . This could have been a great toy if more time had been taken with the instructions , with the propulsion method , with the operation of the upper levels , and with the inclusion of at least two cars . Car racing sets are easy to create but few are created well . The kidlets did n't play with this much beyond the first day , and now I just see pieces of it scattered among the rest of their toys .	-1
Have you ever seen a boy who LOVES the Cars movies stand eagerly by while his parents struggle to put together a toy that is ridiculously hard to assemble ? Have you ever seen that boy try to comprehend why the toy - which looks like the coolest toy ever - does n't work even remotely closely to how it 's supposed to ? Cars that are supposed to zoom across and then end up in the Winner 's Circle either fall off the track , go about three inches , miss the track entirely , or zoom around in circles and just never end up in the winner 's circle.This is seriously one of the worst designed toys I have ever had the misfortune to touch . It ranks up there withChase , the non-transforming Transformer . About the best thing I can say about this toy is that it has n't actually physically hurt my son yet.Now I have to go out to Toys 'R Us and buy my distraught son a toy that actually works to make up for the fact that this thing does n't work . He 's just sitting there and every twenty seconds or so asking me `` why it not work , Daddy ? '' `` Why the car not go on the track , Daddy ? '' `` Why Lightning McQueen not go in the Green thing , Daddy ? '' Thanks a lot Mattel .	-1
Amazon has this toy rated for ages 3-10 but the box itself says it 's for ages 5+ . My son is 4 years old and had no trouble playing with it.To start , the toy was difficult to put together . There are so many pieces and the directions are not straightforward . Worse , some of the plastic parts did not fit together well.Once put together , the toy was n't great . The car is supposed to zoom around the track but it did n't go very fast ( on both the upper and lower tracks ) no matter how much we cranked the handle . The upper track has portions where the car is supposed to do side wheelies . What actually happened was the car stalled and got stuck.In theory , I can see how this looks fun on the drawing board but the reality is my son played with this for several hours , then abandoned it and has n't played with it since . And this is a boy who usually compulsively plays with track toys . So in short , save your money and skip this one .	-1
*This is a disappointment . Here are four reasons.To use the lower track the set must be set on a horizontal , flat , solid , surface . Surfaces it wo n't work on include granite staircases ( not horizontal or flat ) , sand , a black velvet painting of Elvis , and the upper tier of the green at the 18th hole at St. Andrews , which , by the way , you wo n't be able to use for more than about a minute anyway before all kinds of people wearing various comical forms of golfing attire come storming out of the clubhouse RIGHT STRAIGHT AT YOU and waving their arms and yelling at you to get off their precious old sod . Sheesh . For this sincere limitation I subtract one star.Oh , and it also does n't work on carpets or rugs . *The bottom track does have a chance of working on a solid surface such as an oak floor or a tabletop that 's large enough and otherwise unneeded . Other surfaces it works on include a big mirror , a sheet of Lexan , the roof of a Humvee , and a freshly Zambonied ice skating rink , which , by the way , you wo n't be able to use for very long , at least not at Crown Center , before this sad-looking , slope-shouldered , 16-year-old comes slumping out onto the ice and tells you you ca n't set up your Disney/Pixar Cars Stunt Racers Double Decker Speedway there , `` not even in a corner . '' Sheesh.I found the instructions to be generally impenetrable upon the first reading and barely penetrable after the third , and I ended up relying on the pictures on the box and on this very Amazon description page , which shows several views of the assembled track from different vantages . For this I subtract another star . If you are still interested in this product , you will be pleased to learn that its assembly does not require tools such as a hammer or a cordless drill or an oxyacetylene welding torch . *The package comes with exactly one fewer than the minimum required number of cars to have a race , which according to my math is two . The arrangement of dual starting lines and dual launch buttons and dual tracks begs the participants to race one car against another , one on the ground and the other in the air , yet no matter how hard you search amongst the contents of the box , you will not find a second car to race against the one car you do find . To stage races one must drive to a store and spend money to get a second car or use Amazon or some similar online service and spend money to get a second car . Or you could do as I have done and fabricate one yourself , which I can now tell you takes a lot more time and money than you might originally have expected.This failure is plainly stated by the manufacturer right on the box and on the Amazon description page , so it 's not like customers can complain they were taken completely unawares , but it is still a failure , for which I subtract another star . *One more thing is , if you do n't have the added enjoyment of a race , after a pretty short time this toy becomes boring . Except for this one deal where you can alter the upper car 's course into a winner 's circle , it 's the same routine time after time . It 's the same thing over and over , it becomes repetitive , it becomes repetitive , and it become repetitive , for which I subtract one star . *If your math is the same as mine , this baby has lost all the stars it can . *	-1
Well , for 30 bucks , including whatever it costs to include Disney characters , what do we expect.As the other reviewer has pointed out , nearly everything about this toy disappoints . A younger child might have some fun with it , but it is n't well designed or laid out , so savvy buyers should find a way to take their money elsewhere .	-1
Tried through Vine ! The track was put together pretty easily by myself . I have n't tried it on carpet like some reviewers but on the linoleum floor it works pretty well . The upper track is pretty bad in my opinion , and overall I am glad I got this free . I 'd say it could n't be worth more than 15 bucks because it simply is n't fun . I 'd say about 6 years old is the best kid age for this toy but that may be pushing it.I think Disney just let the manufacturer give 'em money and slap their logo on this , and Cars is a far cry from a great Pixar franchise , but someone let it rival Hot Wheels by slapping four times the price on the same toy , basically.Anyway if you must have Cars , I would skip this race track entirely .	-1
It is sad that Disney/Pixar would put out such an inferior product for their young fans of Cars . My three year old grandson loves Cars and Lightening McQueen and it was sad to see his disappointment in this toy . He was so excited to get this and then increasingly frustrated as grandma tries to wade through poorly written instructions . Finally his dad took over and even then it took about a half hour to put it together.Was it worth the frustration ? In a word , no . There is only one car included but the track is designed for two . So right away you know you are n't going to get your money 's worth . The structure is very flimsy and you know it will not last long . You have to crank the cars to make them go . This too was frustrating for a 3 year old . The car did n't go long before it had to cranked again . The stunts do n't always work and you hold your breath that it will do the them.Overall , I would not recommend this product . It 's not well made , well constructed or delivered in a satisfactory manner . If I had paid for this , I would have returned it . It was a major disappointment to a little boy who loves the Cars franchise . Truly it made me wonder how much Disney/Pixar cares for its fans .	-1
The 'Disney/Pixar Cars Stunt Racers Double Decker Speedway ' is a disappointment at best . Delivery was quick and packaging was good . However , it 's all downhill from there . You do n't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out how to put it together but it is n't anywhere near 'easy ' . In fact , the provided instructions are dismal.Being all of 5 years old my grand-daughter is of immense help in deciding the value of toys and she was anticipating some fun with this toy as it is colorful and she really liked the movies . However , as another viewer pointed out , the car completing the upper race circuit is at best chancy and it 's not particularly easy for a child to wind it up to the necessary speed . Perhaps , though , frustration is part of the package as my helper became determined to complete the upper circuit . Completing the bottom circuit is a given but after a few times interest is lost.I did n't find the toy flimsy and think it rather sturdy once assembled . All said , it 's of 'minimal interest ' , though , and will be forgotten in short order .	-1
hated it because what I get are not same as pictured no freckles - I sent it back and told that I want one with freckles ! Otherwise beautiful doll	-1
This is complete junk & do not expect it to last 60 days maybe 90 , that is if she played with it . Such junk , she 's already lost interest in it and Christmas was 7 days ago . When you open the box , there are a jillion pieces and one sheet of instructions that are pictures only . After about 10 pictures they figure both you and they know the pictures are ridiculous and they do n't make any further attempt at instruction - sort of like & # 34 ; OK , we both know this is n't helping , so we 're just going to stop now. & # 34 ; So right now you 're thinking , how difficult can it be ? When the only written instruction on the elevator says , & # 34 ; If it does n't work , force it. & # 34 ; , you know you have junk . The string for the elevator is supposed to be wound around and through & over and under and still it jams and catches between floors while the kid is helplessly jerking on this string in frustration . The elevator is just too big for the elevator tunnel and there is no adjustment whatsoever - just force it - what a concept ! The inserts in the instructions make no sense and are extremely poor quality . The wiring is so below par that I 'm surprised Mattel even has their name on the package . The toilet on this one flushes continually with the smallest vibration from anywhere on the house the toilet flushes - wonderful - so while she 's jerking on the stupid elevator string the toilet flushes like she 's leading an orchestra of toilets . Sure we know it 's a short , but we did n't pay this much money to troubleshoot crap . It is more cardboard than plastic and what plastic is there is ill-fitting and bows out or just pops out of place . The cardboard backing - right out of the package - is warping/curling forward like - well like cheap junk . The impact of seeing this Christmas morning was great , but after a few attempts she went on to other things that worked . She gives it a half-hearted try every now & then but really has no interest in it since the main attraction - the elevator - does n't work . We 'll put it in her room for awhile , but come Spring - & # 34 ; YARD SALE & # 34 ; ! Not worth the money for 90 days of looking at it .	-1
first off I got this on sale after Christmas , paid $ 99.00 and let me tell you its a complete waste of money ! very flimsy , elevator sticks constantly because the parts are not correct ! there is no fixing this , its junk ! everything falls off , I decided to buy plastic shelves and make my own version , much better & far cheaper ! AVOID this ! it will save you alot of stress & frustration & money !	-1
I got this for my almost 2 year old little boy for Christmas . He is really into airplanes right now and I wanted to get him a really cool one to play with . This is not it ! ! I ca n't believe I paid 12 bucks for a tiny piece of plastic barely bigger than his tiny hand . He had zero interest in this ... .I do n't blame him . There is nothing special about this..it looks like it came from a vending machine !	-1
This plane is fine , but within a week the propeller had come off and the paint is already chipping . Poor quality for a $ 10 toy ! ! Should be priced around $ 4.99 ... .I also had the propeller issue on a couple of the other planes I bought at the same time . : ( A sad 3 year old ... just not the same without the propeller for him .	-1
These Monster High sets are really high priced for a scant amount of plasticized material . It actually inspired me to learn how to sew ! Turns out you can buy these doll patterns and make a whole bunch of clothes for very little money . Do n't waste your cash .	-1
Not a fan . This idea is too young for the target group . It will however be very collectable because no one wants to buy it .	-1
In my view , the purpose of this carry case is to provide a container in which to store all the cars one is expected to buy . I 've got kids but they have n't shown any interest in these very tiny cars . The case comes with one car . The car is teeny tiny.I do n't see any other use for this case than the one intended .	-1
This thing was not at all what I expected . It is about the size of a shoebox and comes with a ton of little parts to snap into place and store . Driving your microdrifter lightning mcqueen on the itty bitty road with the backdrop is pointless and my son looked at me and said `` That 's it ? '' . Yep , that is it.The box is a pain in the butt to open , it takes some real work to get it open and then when you do get it open it springs open and everything inside falls out . There is a plastic wall on one of the sides of the holder to keep things in place but that is also really difficult to open.The carrier is really compact but with the decorations sticking up it is hard to store . It has to go on the top of a pile and you can not stack anything on it . My son had no interest in this and it was just taking up space so we recycled it . We do n't miss it at all.This might make a good item for a serious microdrifter collector , but to anyone else it is a high priced piece of plastic .	-1
Out of the box , assembly takes a few minutes what with positioning stickers and insterting the buildings - one or two were a bit tough and would frustrate a child . It is a storage case that doubles as seating for one , not all , of the race tracks in this line . As much as my son LOVES Cars and McQueen , this held his interest for 30 minutes . Then again , these cars are TINY ! ! ! So a storage unit makes sense .	-1
I guess I did not read this right when I first looked at it-I assumed it was a case for ALL small cars-I was in error . This is just for Micro Drifters cars . I was hoping it would fit my sons Mattel and other small cars he had . They should have made the product more commercial so other cars could fit . Just another toy that you have to buy the Disney/Pixar cars for.My son did not like this carrying case at all.Thumbs down !	-1
This doll does not look anything like Ken from the Life in the Dreamhouse series . I got my daughter all the characters to go with her new dreamhouse . The other ones looked just like their characters from the show ( especially Raquelle ) but Ken looks nothing like this doll . The Ken on the show has a fuller face and his hair looks a lot different . The doll itself is made well , I just wish they had taken the time to make sure he looked like the character .	-1
No accessories ! Not sure how to get them . I will not be sending this back , they just need to send me the accessories ! Not sure whose fault it is , Amazon or Mattel but I will be making some calls . Also I am not the only one that had this problem .	-1
Bought for my daughter and we sent it back . Poor quality overall and $ 40 is way overpriced for what you get . Does n't do anything other than play music lowly . Doll was OK , but still returned .	-1
I was taken aback when I read the other reviews . People liked it and to further the confusion , they were actually counting how many cars they could get on the track ! ? Our counting stopped at one , after one and the cars would fall off the track , dropping like flies after attempting the very first loop.The directions were clear and the track was fairly easy to put together . Assembly time : approximately 15-30 minutes , a whopping 4 D batteries were not included ( surprise , surprise ) . The first included car was propelled at a high rate of speed along the track and maintained this . Excitedly we added a second car and were immediately disappointed when it could not complete the very first loop , then both cars fell off dropping like flies . In an attempt to solve the problem we tried different things . We changed the batteries to ones right out of the package - brand spanking new , we moved the track onto a hard kitchen floor- thinking the carpet was perhaps a problem , we tried adding a book on the track base for weight ( as indicated in the directions ) , also tried a multitude of other cars . The results were the same each time , one car worked - but two or more , no way . Even the first car would fall off after a short time . Disastrous . It appears as if the propulsion wheels that accelerate the cars need to be spinning at a faster rate.The only credit I can give for this track , is that the track seems to be better made than some of those out there that are thin and hard , cheaply made . It also was fun to change the cars track by pulling two levers . We did not have the necessary iPad for extended play.In conclusion , my kids were disappointed , why should n't they be ? The box was misleading it showed 6 cars on the track racing and wreaking havoc with crashes . This track set will not be a hit at our house .	-1
Having played with Hot Wheels and tracks as a kid , I was really looking forward to the excitement of multiple cars on a sturdy track . With one car , it works well . Pulling levers at the right time to get the car to switch tracks is fun . Otherwise , this track was a huge let-down . * Two cars did n't stay on the track . They kept flying off . Do not use multiple cars near anything valuable or breakable . * It 's really large . That 's not a con in and of itself , but it will be difficult to store . * When on , it 's LOUD , like a Dustbuster . * To produce the loud sound , you need 4 D batteries . * It 's wobbly . If your instructions suggest bracing with a book , I 'd suggest making it already braced . That seems like a design flaw they should have corrected . * Tablet support is for iPad only . This might seem like a drawback , but given the actual app , trust me , it 's not . It 's a weak app with poor animation that uses the camera function of the iPad . It 's more fun without the app .	-1
i was really pissed about this toy . my son begged and begged and begged me to get him this race track and fortunately amazon was the cheapest place that i found this race track . I ordered the race track and after all of my other orders arrived at my house i still had n't received this race track . I did n't even get a call from amazon to let me know something was wrong . I had to contact Amazon myself . Then they tell me that this race track was in stock the day i ordered it but unfortunately it recently became out of stock and we are going to have to refund your money . Well you tell that to a 3 year old little boy on Christmas . needless to say i never did receive the damn race track .	-1
very cool toy , kids are enthralled , but the longest loop de loop track doesnt work . The rubber rollers do not generate enough force to propel the car that came with the toy all the way around the loop . the car gets half way up and drops to the ground . The other two loops work great . Kids seem to be satisfied with the toy 's limitations but it 's absurd the biggest loop doesnt work . We have tried with other , lighter cars , and still no luck . Furthermore , The D batteries start to fade so the rubber rollers start to slow imperceptibly , and then the other two loop de loops start to fail too , cars drop to the ground half way around the loop . So sad ... .	-1
Not very durable , hands fall off , small pieces . Got it for 5 year old , but very fragile toy . Is this planned obsolescence for toys .	-1
They make these cheap and easily breakable . Bought for my daughter , and these are great to look at in the box , not so much for playing . Most pieces were lost in a day .	-1
Was unable to find an `` age range '' for this toy , and got it thinking my 6 year old grandson would enjoy it . He did , for about 10 minutes . He went back to it once in 5 days and fiddled with it again for 4 or 5 minutes . He recognized the character and initially seemed interested , but once he realized the extent of what it does , he lost interest quickly . For him , it was a bust.Time it took to assemble and cost of the batteries to power the driver-tool far exceeded the entertainment value of the toy . Also there were no instructions , so we had to figure out what the battery-operated thing was for by seeing what it fit . Would n't recommend it .	-1
I am a huge fan of Jake 's pirate ship that came out about a year ago , so was excited to be offered this hideout . But it was very disappointing.First off , you are supposed to use this tiki to turn and open the hideout . Well , it 's HUGE and it 's BEHIND the leaves , so it makes it very hard to use it to open it . All my kids basically discarded the tiki and ended up pulling the leaves open manually ; which of course leads to the eventually breaking off and me having to constantly put them on again for them . They should have put a button on the backside of the hideout to open the leaves ; simple but still neat.Second , the `` slide '' does not snap on at all , it just sits in the hole . Well , it 's also basically unusable because it just comes right off if you breathe on it.So I just ca n't recommend the toy . The idea of it is REALLY neat like all the Jake the Pirate items . But it 's just very poorly executed and disappointing because of that . I do love the boat they made in this set ; so if your son or daughter likes Jake the Pirate I HIGHLY recommend that one !	-1
I ordered this mostly for the long haired , ponytailed Cleo that was supposed to come with it but instead I got a Scaris Cleo with the Oasis clothes and accessories . I want to say whoever sent me this traded out the actual doll and jipped me in the process but it was so well packaged that I honestly think Mattel screwed up.The Oasis itself is lovely but , like I said , I just wanted the doll so this kind of ruined it for me.For others looking for a new Cleo that already have her Scaris doll this will probably end up being disappointing .	-1
My daughter bought this with her own money , she liked it a a few weeks . Now she never plays with it , and has lost some of the pieces . Its hard to store w/o loosing pieces .	-1
i have a special needs child that still plays with toys although she is 13. this toy was right up her alley because she LOVES polly pocket . she found it easy to take out of the box and set up BUT then she proceeded to lose every single part . it 's a cute set . It 's durable . it just wound up not being played with because of small parts . it also had a LOT of packaging for what it actually was .	-1
This Barbie doll is a seven-year-old 's dream . It 's a ballerina . It 's a butterfly . It 's pink . It 's glittery . It 's very , very , very glittery . That 's beautiful in a box , not so much in a kid 's room , or on her little brother , or on the cat , or in her hair . And while it provided a big bang out of the box , my daughter has n't touched it since because it 's just not very playable.From the front , the Mariposa Fairy Princess doll is very pretty . But the side and rear view are less than pleasant because Barbie has a HUGE contraption built into her back to hold her fairy wings . A little knob on her back can be hand-cranked to turn down her wings , which fold over her legs to create a gown . It 's kind of clever , but only for a few minutes . The wings do n't flutter , they do n't unfurl slowly and beautifully . Instead , they are covered in glitter which comes off pretty easily and is rather a mess . My daughter got hung up on her hair , which looks short in the product description and on the package , but is really just standard length Barbie hair caught up in a ponytail.This Barbie doll is just too much feature and not enough fun .	-1
The doll looks beautiful in the box , but once removed the concept gets in the way of play . So , I wonder if this doll is meant to be left in the box as a display piece because the process to unfurl the wings , and fold down the wings is a bit clunky and awkward for a child . Additionally , it creates more of a mechanical toy , like a Transformer , than a doll.The backpack contraption permanently installed in the back of the doll is intrusive both visually and practically . The mechanism does not operate smoothly . And , the glitter on the wings seemed to get on everything , again causing me to think that perhaps the doll should be left in the box as a display item rather than used as an actual toy.It is clear that the intention was creative but the execution unsuccessful . It might have been preferable to just create a less high-tech , more flexible costume that included Mariposa wings that could be worn by simply slipping the doll 's arms through a loop at each shoulder , and when the child tired of that , remove the wings and perhaps slip on a beautiful long skirt to create the idea of a ball gown for the Fairy Princess.I wanted to like the doll , loved the way it looked , but the functionality simply was not there .	-1
My daughter loves the Mariposa movies and was excited to try the Barbie doll . The doll itself is very pretty with potential for a lot of fun . However , after assembling the wings and playing with the doll for less than an hour , the mechanism broke . Now we have a doll with limp wings and no way to fix it . It 's also very limited in that you ca n't change the clothes easily nor take the wings off once you have them on . For the price , I guess I expected better quality .	-1
I got this for my 4 year olds & # 34 ; Purple Barbie & # 34 ; birthday . The doll is very pretty but the one wing broke immediately . My husband put it together and may have done it wrong but now it wo n't come off to try and fix . I missed my return window on Amazon . The ad looks so cool if the wings work right . She still plays with it though and is happy .	-1
Glitter appears everywhere ! , , , , in the boy , on the doll , on the face , hands ... Do n't like the idea.The doll is pretty , just hate the glitter .	-1
A first glance this Barbie is very pretty . Her dress is gorgeous , he is wearing a beautiful necklace and really cool shoes . On second glance you begin to realize this Barbie can not be used for anything . The top of her dress is painted on . The fairy wings are affixed to her back by a large apparatus that is part of the doll and the skirt does not come off because of the `` opening '' skirt feature . So basically this Barbie is only good for the movie , or DVD tie-in . Kids can not dress her , change her clothing ... the only thing this doll does - the wings flip up and the dress flips out to the side by pushing a button . Once a child has done this a time or two , they will want to change her clothes and with the wing fixture and the opening skirt -- they are out of luck . I love Barbies but this one is a total disappointment .	-1
I ordered this Barbie doll for my 4-year old daughter and I was shocked at the poor quality . First of all , the dolls fairy wing mechanism was dead on arrival . The push-button in the middle of Barbie 's belly is sharp and jagged and hurts to push . Needless to say , my daughter was extremely upset about the doll not producing any sound and the wings not moving . Looks like we got a dud !	-1
Barbie Mariposa must have taken some engineering , but they 'll have to go back to the drawing board . Her dress is wired up with thin plastic tubes that are supposed to swish up when the button on her stomach is pressed . There 's also a big butterfly gizmo on her back , to which the fairy wings are attached and can be moved up and down ( manually ) . Unfortunately , the belly button , at least on this particular doll , does nothing . It 's impossible to push the fairy skirt into its folded down position - push it down , it pops back up . This is a silly product with very little purpose or play value . Her clothes ca n't even be changed . You 've got to wonder what they were thinking when they released this dud of a product .	-1
While this Barbie is very pretty to look at , my daughter does not like to play with it . The skirt does not pop open as it is expected to . The skirt does not come off so it 's not possible to change her outfit . The unremovable skirt is not why I have given this doll a low rating . It is because the button does not function properly and as a result , left my ordinarily very patient child very frustrated . Unless you are looking for a pretty display doll , I would skip this one if your child intends to play with it .	-1
Mattel just keeps thinking of new ways to market the same figure in a new costume . Little girls love Barbie and little girls love butterflies . Hey , let 's make Barbie a butterfly ! What child can say no to that ? Great idea for cartoons , hard to make work in toy form.This Barbie is just very limiting for a child . Her wings do not move . If they could have mechanized a way to do that and make them flutter , this one would be a huge hit . We had a fairy doll that does and the kids went crazy over it.The bodice of her dress is molded/painted onto her body . A nice feature in some ways , but the back of her skirt is permanently stitched to the back of her waist the same way that the Tori/Popstar doll is . It can not be removed and my kids want to know if they can cut it off.One of the `` joys '' of having Barbie is changing her clothes constantly . That can not be done with this one . Barbie the mutant butterfly/X-men trainee is smiling despite having a skirt stitched to her body and immovable wings . Her true joy in this life is knowing that she will soon be attending classes with Wolverine . That is why she keeps smiling.I would not recommend this doll to anyone . It was a real killjoy and was thrown quickly into the box of `` maybe someday '' toys with reckless abandon .	-1
Our eight year old loves Barbie and was excited to get this . She loved the costume but was disappointed none of the advertised features worked . The switch/button for the costume change was a dud . And the wings could only be moved manually .	-1
The top of Elsa 's dress is painted on . My Granddaughter did n't want her . I returned the doll and purchased the sisters and Kristoff from The Disney Store fully clothed with fabric . My Granddaughter is thrilled with them .	-1
This doll . Is poorly made the dress is , poorly made and of poor workmanship . And it was not , what I ordered I am disgusted with Amazon !	-1
Use caution as we received a knock off that was in a Anna box and not close to a Disney doll .	-1
Our Elsa arrived with no shoes on , even though the package clearly shoes the doll in blue sparkly shoes . Other reviewers mentioned shoes as well . I 'm very disappointed as is my daughter .	-1
My little one got this doll from his sister and started licking off the painted top of the dress.The doll itself is cheaply made but that might be forgiven as it is a case with all Mattel dolls , however the painted on outfit is another story . It should not be the case.My older daughter was so happy and proud of her Elsa dress that I got her at Disney Store , the dress was AMAZING , she was supposed to take the costume and the doll on the trip toDisneyland during the Spring Break because of course we know it from our past trips duringthe Sofia or Tangled release that the newest movie never comes to the Parks in terms ofcostumes or dolls until a year or so later . We got very disappointed twice so we knowthat there is NO WAY there will be any costume to buy nor doll to have there from the Frozen movieand of course all kids will be bringing their costumes with them so that would be disappointing.Now one doll wasted later we are back to the drawing board and I have to look for another Elsa doll.My two older girls are going this year one as Anna and another as Elsa to Disney and they are so proud oftheir costumes . I feel very lucky and happy about the costumes we grabbed at the Dsiney store becauseof course now they are sold out too.If you can find anywhere authentic Disney dolls , do go with them instead . The same goes to the costumes.Stay away from toys store items that are cheap and end up in the trash .	-1
This doll is very cheap plastic ! The dress rips easy and the sparkles go everywhere ! My daughter loves Elsa but this doll is for the birds	-1
This is NOT a sparkle doll like the rest despite what they claim ! This is made of squishy plastic , Hair is nothing like picture , vey very cheaply made toy . This is what I expect from a dollar store !	-1
This doll is a scam for Elsa , it looks so fake , the hair is made of plastic and ca n't be moved , same goes for the legs and arms which ca n't be moved . The dress is green rather than blue.There is no crown in the set.I wanted bought this product and the original Disney doll . The cheaper one for friends daughter and the Disney one for my little sister . All I can say is that I could n't give this doll because I will look bad , so I bought another Disney Doll after refunding this one.Check the Disney Elsa doll here : http : //amzn.to/1njtym0	-1
My son got this toy for his birthday . After shooting it maybe twenty times , the trigger got stuck and the plane would n't shoot . I had to take it apart and fix the springs . It has poor springs and mechanisms .	-1
Kristoff 's upper body has clothes that are painted on , instead of natural arms which a child can re-dress ... .. ( something that children love to do ) When doll is undressed he has painted arms . If your child loves these characters and plays with them , buy them from the , `` Disney store '' , ( cost a few dollars more but worth it ) for much better quality thus more fun for the children . My child and I received the , `` Anna '' and `` Elsa '' , dolls from Amazon ( which is my biggest supplier ) and the whole upper bodies are painted with rubber paint . My 4 yr. old did n't want then . She noticed right away that the clothes could not come off as she looked in the box . The dolls are beautiful but they are DRESSED CHEAPLY ! She said , '' I do n't like them now '' . She is 4 . She loves to re-dress Barbie 's and baby dolls.She wanted to do the same with this collection.Hope this helps	-1
The top of Anna 's dress is painted on . I returned the doll and purchased Anna and Elsa fully clothed with fabric from The Disney Store . My Granddaughter was delighted with them .	-1
As the other reviewers said , the doll is stiff , the cloths are very cheap made . The hair is falling after 3 hours of my sister playing with it.I bought this one , after I refunded the old one : http : //amzn.to/1pqZs3l ( the exact same link I got it from ) The new doll is very good , it can sing too : ) , cloths are n't cheap and they are resistant . Buy it now through amazon and get fast and careful shipping : http : //amzn.to/1pqZs3l	-1
i saw this set at walmart and got it . when i opened it i noticed ghoulia , s arm was missing . i looked around in the box but it wasent there . my sis said maybe thats how shes supposed to be . i returned the set the next day	-1
I honestly did n't have a lot of hope for this toy going in . I had multiple color change toys as a child , and none of them lived up to my expectations . It got old asking Mom to toss a doll 's dress or a stuffed animal or a toy car in the dryer or trying to make room in the freezer to achieve the change.There was always the possibility that the technology had advanced enough to where stuff actually worked as it was supposed to . Unfortunately , that 's not the case here.The cold wand has a cartridge inside that has to be filled with water and frozen . The `` hot wand '' ( which does n't actually get hot ) requires AAA batteries ( which we had to scavenge ) . Armed with only the hot wand at first , I discovered that nothing changed on the clothing . At all . So the toy is no good to you right out of the box , as you have to wait for the cold wand to freeze . Once it did , it did change the color on her clothing . Finally . So apparently the `` hot wand '' is for changing the color back once you 've changed it with cold ... good to know . Also , the freezer cartridge is small and could easily get lost in the freezer or thrown away - my husband had no clue what it was when he found it.You can use warm and cold water to achieve the changes , as well . There 's a makeup applicator which can be dampened with cold water and rubbed on her face . I got the best results with this and at least it can be done right out of the box- I used cold water and got her `` makeup '' to appear after several passes . There is a dipping station for her limbs , sand a misting bottle for her hair , as well . This means more points against , though , because it just is n't as much fun as using the wands would be if they actually worked . You have to dry the bits off , and children are going to wind up spilling water everywhere . If you use water on her dress or hair , you 're going to have to wait for them to dry ... and the color will then go back ! The furniture is cute , and it fits in well with other Monster High playsets . You basically get a little dresser with shelves , a rolling cart , and a `` monster slab '' that the dolls can recline on.The doll herself is unremarkable . The best part about her is that her wig is completely removable , so your child can have a bald doll if he or she wishes ( which is rare in itself ) . I would assume that this also means there will be more wigs in the future , so that children can mix and match.The bottom line is that I would n't pay the $ 39.00 Amazon price . It has its good points , but the color change features are supposed to be the main focus - and they fall flat .	-1
My daughter is a Monster High fanatic ... and basically has anything and everything to do with Monster High . So when she received this newest MH Design Chamber she was happy and excited . Now this is the second Create A Monster kit that 's out , the first one was the design lab which my daughter enjoyed very much and loved how the doll she created came out . she did have a few difficulties with it but overall she was pleased ! Now with this one , Im sorry to say but NOTHING worked and she was very disappointed and so was I . None of the colors or designs would rub off on the doll , the wig never stayed in place , all in all it was just a waste of time no matter how hard we tried or did everything as instructed . I will say that the set up was very nice and easy , cute accessories and was much easier to assemble than the MH design lab and that 's the only plus when it came to this . But the Design Chamber itself was a fail ... . I think you will get a better looking monster if you stick with the previous MH Create A Monster design lab .	-1
Does very little . The pens are basically useless no matter their temperature . we ended up with tears over the disappointment of this gift .	-1
i am not one to give a bad review unless something is truly worthy of a bad one , but this was so cheap , the structure wo n't hold up & # 128531 ; so poorly made , and for the price , I am not happy , nor is my daughter , she can not really play with it because it falls apart , the entire toy keeps falling all apart , every piece to the shower , it wont stay in the holes or slots to the inside doll stand , it wont hold the dolls , she has many of the monster high play pieces , and so far , no real complaints , a few here and there , and yes , its always the poor quality , but this toy , is by far the worst one yet , I wont recommend this , especially not to small children , or any children , im sure they all want to play with it at some point , not just look at it , but that is all you can do , crappy , poorly made , very poorly , falls apart , sorry , just being honest	-1
This shower playset is cute , but as with a lot of the other monster high playsets it is flimsy.We got this set for my daughters birthday present in Feb and the shower hook broke in less than a month ( resulting in it not holding the doll in the shower ) . Prior to it breaking whenever my daughter would hook the doll into the shower it would fall off the base ( sort of like how the dolls stands disconnect from the base ) . Regardless it is a cute set if you do not mind putting it back together often . It is not durable or study and I am slowly getting to the point where I may not buy any monster high furniture in the future because most of them are too flimsy for me .	-1
Purchased this for my 3 year old for Christmas . While the toy is cute and simple and she does enjoy playing with the characters and pressing the voice button , it is very difficult to get each character onto the heart shaped spot on the sink that triggers the voice . Usually she will hand me the toy and I will struggle for a few tries to position the character in the right spot . NOT FOR LITTLE HANDS !	-1
The concept is cute , however this toy is hard to use- the handles get stuck and its almost impossible to rotate as it should . Would pass on this product , just buy the accessories separately and keep them in a Tupperware .	-1
My five-year-old daughter seems to prefer the smaller dolls for play , so I thought this set would be perfect for her . Size-wise , it does n't take up very much space and the castle playset comes with everything your child will need to act out stories with the Barbie characters Mariposa and Catania . My daughter has never seen the Barbie Mariposa movies , and it has no impact whatsoever on her enjoyment of the playset . She has fun making up her own stories and moving the small figurines from one part of the castle to another.ASSEMBLY REQUIREDFor the most part , the set is almost fully put together when you remove it from the box . I appreciated I did n't have to attach any stickers to the playset because I can never get them as perfectly aligned and as smooth as I want . The plastic the pieces are made from is pretty thin , and it might be possible to damage it if you are n't careful when attaching them . Be sure to stick to the instruction 's guidelines , because most of the pieces do n't come out once you snap them in.The most difficult part for me was # 2 on the instruction , affixing the pink top floor to the white columns . This was easily the most frustrating part for me ; everything else was mostly straightforward , though there was confusion over which small decorative piece needed to go on top of the castle so the fairies could spin . Overall , it took maybe twenty or so minutes to get it all put together and the loose pieces into the castle where the box shows them.TINY PIECESTruly , I 'm surprised to see that this toy is recommended for ages three and up . There are so many tiny pieces for children to lose , and they could easily be swallowed by a child who has a habit of putting toys in his or her mouth . If you have older children at home as well as younger ones , keep this toy far away from the younger ones ! Also , you might think you are missing pieces in the set , but you are n't . The instruction guide says you have to attach some pieces to the bed , but upon closer inspection those pieces were already a part of the two beds . Those additional pieces are shown as separate attachments on the front of the pretty-much-useless pamphlet . Perhaps the biggest disappointment is the lack of a mirror for the upstairs of the castle . The box clearly shows one , so we thought we were missing a piece and I was going to write to Mattel and ask them for it . However , on the instruction guide where it shows all the pieces , no mirror is listed . I do n't know if there actually is supposed to be one , or if the instruction guide is wrong about this like it is about some of the other pieces too.QUALITYThe dolls included with this toy are a bit lower quality than I would have liked . They are barely a step up from the little plastic Barbie dolls that I 've seen in the impulse-buy area at the checkout at Target . We bought our daughter one of those dolls once and pieces of her neck started to break off . Of course , this upset my little girl . We glued the doll back together as best we could , but eventually I think the toy was thrown away . Hopefully these dolls will not suffer the same fate ; I hate seeing my daughter disappointed because companies do n't put much thought into the quality of their toys.TIPFor the spinner at the top of the castle , the dolls fit into them by snapping their chests to the seats . If you look closely , you 'll see that the `` seats '' are shaped exactly like Barbie 's chest area , so that 's where you snap them in.OVERALLUnfortunately , this is n't a must-have toy . It was aggravating to assemble , the quality of the toy leaves plenty to be desired , and the smaller pieces will be easy to lose track of if parents or child are not attentive to them .	-1
My girls love it because it 's pink , and tiny and it 's so girly ... BUT I HATE IT because it 's tiny , and easily breaks apart . Not to mention one of the pieces was missing from packaging , and it 's so cheap too ! ! !	-1
Very tiny . Wings on minimus keep falling off . Bought for my five-year-old daughter who played with it for about a minute . Overpriced .	-1
Price is WAY to much . when opening the package sophias head popped off . The hat does not stay on , the wings do not stay on , Her seat is a push button but it does not do anything ? ? and when the wings are on its hard to even get to the button . NOT worth $ 5 let alone this price . Got it for my Daughters 3d bday and Once the head popped off ( it goes back on ) she was over it !	-1
I was actually excited to give this to my daughter , who is a huge Sofia/Minimus fan.As soon as I opened the package , I knew we were in for problems.Sofia is very small ( 2 1/2 & # 34 ; maybe ? ) , which is ok , just be aware that it 's a small figure ! Her hat ? Constantly falls off . I 'm not even sure where the damn thing is now.Minimus ? I was under the impression that you can push the tail and the wings flap , or something like that . Nope . The & # 34 ; flying & # 34 ; part of minimus is when you shake him up and down , forcing his wings to bobble . And then eventually , fall off.Yeah , the wings come off really easily.After reattaching them at least 50 times , I glued them on . And then they still broke off . hahaLastly.. WTF is up with the seat ? It looks like it was supposed to do something and then the manufacturer decided not to use that feature . Very strange.With all that said , my daughter still loves it . As long as dada is there to put the wings back on , all is well .	-1
Got this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter for christmas but she immediately was frustrated that the swing kept falling off when she tried to put Arial in it and now she does n't even want to play with it at all . Not made very well , a little flimsy .	-1
I like the other 's I have read on here , have had problems with this set as well . My daughter opened the package and first thing , the doll 's head popped off and does so all the time . Package is already opened so I ca n't return it , thankfully I 'm only out $ 10 or so for it . I expect a lot more out of companies like Disney , especially with their toys . This is a multi-billion dollar company and yet they ca n't afford to make dolls with heads that will stay on ... ..shame shame shame , Mickey you should be ashamed , I 'm going to need your `` Mouse-a-toodle '' to fix my daughters toy .	-1
This playset is not made well . The head immediately was pulled off of Sofia and the animals are very small and could become a choking hazard . Sofia has been tossed in the garbage and the animals have been put out of reach of my toddler .	-1
It is very small and did not like the details of the wrist . I did not like . I hope not to disappoint the girl	-1
This doll looked so pretty in the picture , and the other 2 reviews of it were so positive ... .when we got ours , it looked like she had been played with ! The hair was greasy-looking and the right side of her hairdo was messed up , almost as if she had stuck her head out a car window . I did n't bother taking her out of the box , my Sofia-fan-in-residence took one look and said & # 34 ; NO ! & # 34 ; ... and put her back into the Amazon box . I did notice that the dress this doll wears is not exactly what Sofia wears -- the character 's dress has the flower design only around the hem , whereas this doll has it all over the skirt ... and the doll 's tiara is white , not silver like the character . Do n't know if this would deter some kids , I just thought it would bear mentioning , in case your child is detail-oriented .	-1
The Polly Pocket Wall Party Mall on the Wall playset does n't stay on the wall ! Is this an oxymoron ? I have a 5 year old daughter who plays very nicely with her toys and even she said `` daddy , this is junky '' ! Straight from the mouth of a babe ! Avoid this one .	-1
Everyone likes UNO , right ? Not when you bundle it with a clunky device that sounds like a demonic toilet flushing . This is the new worst sound I 've ever heard , and even if you enjoy the unpredictability of when the cards will shoot out , there is no way to turn the horrible sound off or even down.The instructions are pretty scant on info about how the device works or what to expect from it , so we played the first ten minutes with this horrible beeping noise blaring every few seconds . We finally realized that was the 'change battery ' alert . But again , even with new batteries , the sound effect was beyond awful . Oh and did I mention the ridiculously difficult to open packaging ? It took two people and a rather large knife several minutes to pry this thing loose.Bottom line , we would never use this thing again . Save yourself the money and just buy a simple and cheap deck of UNO cards .	-1
UNO is a fun game . My family has played UNO tons of times . UNO = fun . UNO Blast = UNO - fun.I unwrapped said toy from the box . My wife said , `` I like UNO , let 's play '' . So we loaded the blaster up with the required 3 AA batteries and proceeded to play . Until the BLAST went off . At which my wife said to me , `` it 's evil , kill it ! '' . I reached for the blaster and realized that the creators of UNO Blast did not include a volume switch . This would have been handy as the only blasting that I did was the soiling of my pants every time the ear-splitting shriek went off.On a positive note , the game included UNO . We 'll be keeping the cards handy . Not so for the blaster .	-1
Forget about a relaxing time playing card this Uno Blast is very noisy you will never get relax when you know the cards will pop out , you 'll need to learn new boring rules , I prefer the classic UNO , this game is too unpredictable , noisy and stressfully for me .	-1
Our family loves playing UNO , and I thought this version would be especially fun for my active 5yo son . Unfortunately , what I thought would be some fast-paced fun turned into an incredibly annoying experience ! This game is SO LOUD . It 's just too much . I searched in vain for a volume button , of course there is n't one . The game itself is also just unnecessarily complicated . I was really disappointed ! The traditional UNO game is simple and fun , and about 1,000 times better than this `` new and improved '' version of it . Save your money , some batteries , and your sanity and stick with the regular deck of cards !	-1
As a member of Amazon Vine , I chose this toy to review , but Amazon screwed up and sent me the older , annoying version and that 's the toy I tested and reviewed . When I submitted my review , Amazon put it on this page with the newer version of the toy . I have contacted Amazon by phone and email to no avail . Their canned email response was to simply delete my review , but if I do that I ca n't continue to participate in the Vine program because there will be no review of the toy they sent me . I 'm sure the new toy is better because it is not battery operated and that would eliminate the annoying motor sound and the music . Here is the review I wrote about the toy they sent me . Remember , I did not choose this page to post my review , Amazon placed it . What a mess ! It sounded great . . . balls popping up everywhere . It sounded like something my 13 month old grandson would love since he loves to play ball . The reality was much different . First of all , it comes without batteries so be prepared with 4 `` D '' batteries . Next is the noise factor . It sounds like a small vacuum cleaner . However , the noise did not bother my grandson at all . After I assembled it and added the batteries , I turned it on . The balls did not pop out everywhere . They popped out of the same place each time . Since I had it on a hardwood floor , the balls hit the floor and immediately rolled under the furniture . Within seconds all the balls were inaccessible to my grandson . I was the one who had to get down on the floor to retrieve the balls that were stuck under the furniture . I do n't think this would have been a problem on a carpeted floor . However , it did n't really matter that the balls were under the furniture because the toy never engaged my grandson . He watched it for a minute and toddled off . My 6 year old granddaughter played with it for about 2 minutes and then she wandered off . Bottom line - I do not recommend this toy if you are looking for something that is highly engaging to a young child .	-1
My son quickly decided to move along . We got him this for Easter ( he has 4 of the transformers this trailers and loves them ) and seemed to be quickly annoyed that the cars did n't really stay put and that the trailer separates from optimums pretty easily . We were surprised it was so cheap , but when we got the toy we saw it was n't as well made as we would hope . I would skip this .	-1
My son really wanted a transformer for christmas , especially the red and blue one . I remember transformers from when I was younger and they have definitely changed since then . If I had known how cheap and well just plain crappy this was , I would not have bought it . It actually came with a car carrier that hooks to the transformer to load other cars on and tow , it is even more flimsy and cheap than the transformer is .	-1
OK , I do understand that people are collecting these as display dolls , but I wanted to give this Barbie a chance to play with other Barbie dolls , under my daughter 's supervision.This Barbie has a very odd look on her face - my husband was alarmed when we opened the box , saying `` it 's Paris Hilton ! '' And now I ca n't un-see the resemblance ! The doll body shape is even skinnier than a normal Barbie , she is not at all poseable , her giant skirt is way to long , and the white plastic snowflakes on the dress overlay seem too fragile for play.All in all , this is definitely a Barbie destined for the sidelines .	-1
What I mean is the pieces do n't click together the way legos do and after putting just a few pieces together I could feel myself getting more and more irritated by the amount of pinching force required . In fact , after ten minutes my hand was feeling a bit numb.While the picture makes this look like legos , the reality is far far different.Also , the set was n't very fun , I could n't figure out why the giant gorilla had such an angry expression and what the heckola is going on with the human banana man ? Who even came up with the banana man concept ? Seriously , it seems a bit creepy for a children 's toy , fruit shaped human edibles ? Really , it 's fun kiddos ! Anyways , In addition to the tasty human banana there 's a woman driving a jungle transport with a banana on top , my guess is she 's trying to entice the giant angry gorilla away from banana man with a piece of fruit roughly 1/20th banana man 's size . Does n't seem very likely , but it might just be crazy enough to work.There 's some random exposed pipe work , so I guess if the kids get tired of the angry gorilla vs. banana man antics they can move onto some shoddy plumbing drama.All in all , not the best toy .	-1
When it comes to building block playsets , you ca n't help but compare everyone to Lego . They own the space , and with good reason . Simply put , they are the bar that everyone will be measured against . That 's not to say that you ca n't put out a quality set if you 're not Lego . So with that in mind , my son and I set out to tackle the Kreo Haunted Hideaway . Right off the bat , I could n't help but think of theLEGO Monster Fighters Vampyre Castle 9468 . That set is usually well over a hundred dollars . This is one is significantly less . And you can immediately see why.The mini figs are terrible . Forget Lego . Kreo has done much better minifigs . For example just look at the figures in theHasbro KRE O Battleship Combat Chopper Playsetset . Its clear that they can make a decent minifig . The characters included in this particular set are based around a one block wide model . Seriously reduced articulation and not much fun to play with . But maybe thats because of the sonic motion gimmick . When you attach these figs to special blocks they are supposed to vibrate their way around the playset , crossing bridges and battling one another . Thats fun , right ? More often than not , our figs fell over or toppled off of the platforms they were walking on . Not so much fun.I talked with my son who has put together his fair share of building block kits . He said the best feature of this Kreo was a small rocket launcher on a car . Not the sonic motion . Not the pop up skeleton crypt . And certainly not the minifigs . Its an inexpensive set , sure . But the play value that you 'd find in a kit likeLEGO Movie 70801 Melting Room , or evenMega Bloks Halo UNSC Seige Bikejust is n't there . Sorry , Kreo . Hope your next outing is more fun .	-1
My son loves it because he doesnt know much about how it could make him sound but the voice changer part on the one we got is broken , nothing happens when you push that button . He loves making it say the Darth Vader phrases though ...	-1
It always pays to read reviews before you buy . The toy , at whatever cost , is simply a piece of junk that no kid would like to play with . The hair is not soft , and the clips brittle . My kid does not even spend 10 minutes with the toy .	-1
If your little one is n't big on having Sunset Shimmer , avoid this pack altogether and get one of the other Twilights . The hair is a really cheap microthin hair that knots in minutes compared to the regular cheap nylon pony hair ( which is n't great but better than this ) . I am anticipating having to behead , shave and reroot Sunset Shimmer when her head becomes a knarly mess -- which will probably happen next week even though my 4 year old is gentle ( luckily her mom has experience , tools and patience to fix dolls ) . I will probably just replace Twilight with one of he others on sale . It also should be noted that Sunset Shimmer 's arms are jointed while Twiligt 's are not . I know Hasbro did this so you could get Sunset 's jacket off , but t is a shame they did n't just sell her as a single deluxe doll instead of being greedy and selling two dolls with extra hair as a two-pack . The faces are very cute . Love the cutie mark on Sunset 's leg . My daughter seems extra excited to have the `` rebel '' pony girl , too , so I give it 2 instead of one stars for that .	-1
Human-horse hybrid dolls are weird and raise a lot of strange questions I 'd just rather not think about , but my daughters think they 're cool.They may be cool in the eyes if the elementary school set , but they 're also extremely breakable . Within days , these dolls were decimated . Not just destroyed , but so absolutely decimated that I could n't even begin to glue them back together . Heads not just popped off , but cracked off . Arms that could n't be reattached . Missing shoes that meant the dolls were completely footless.It 's not like I ran them over with my car or anything . My daughters played with them in the same fashion they 've played with their Barbies and the like . We 've had dollar-store dolls that held up better . These are just flat-out poorly made .	-1
Cute but cheaply made . The hair is thin and tangles easily , the brush pulls strands out as you brush . The strip they have to be the tail is thin and barely there at all , Monster High does better hair then this . I knew these were going to be cheap little dolls , but I was hoping for better made . It shows two brushes in the picture , but it only comes with one , the earrings are the kind that you hang on the ears and if you 're not careful , they come off easily .	-1
Not sure if it just the one we got but the tail will not stay on ! It is like it is broken ! Very dissappointing because my son has all the ninja turtles and some of the other & # 34 ; bad guys & # 34 ; i.e . shredder , krang , and dog ound . But this is by far the biggest let down . It is not good quality , like the others are .	-1
The arms / branches fall off constantly with just normal play ( walking it around and such ) . My son loves ninja turtles and initially thought it was awesome but within minutes it fell apart and we kept fixing it and within a week he abandoned it all together .	-1
At first glance this is a cute and durable toy , but the colors really seemed aimed at girls . Toddler boys might actually play with this if it was n't mostly pink and purple . The sound effects are cute , but may discourage kids from making up their own songs . After a very short while , parents might be tempted to take the battery out . The toy parents are stereotypical , middle-class Caucasians . The mom has blonde hair and a pink shirt and the dad has brown hair and a V-neck sweater . We 're giving it a 1 for educational value because you may want to think about the message this is really teaching your kids . If you want to expand your toddler 's horizons , choose one of the other sets . ( As the box shows , the non-Caucasian toy kids do n't have a house ; they appear only in the playground and the grocery store sets . )	-1
I 'm very disappointed in it . I ordered the one that comes with hassle free packaging , so that was great because I got it out of the box in no time . The problem came when I started to build it . I 'm sure it would n't take too long if they would have built it right . The balcony portion simply does n't align with the rest of the tower , so i 'm not able to place any of the three screws in . My poor baby was so desperate to play with it and I simpy was n't able to build it properly . Right now , the tower and the top ramp are just dangling . She keeps handing me the & # 34 ; kitties & # 34 ; , ( she 's 19 months old and calls the horses kitties ) to place them on the ramp and sways to simulate the galloping . I place them on but they just do n't go down the ramp correctly . I 'm going to be returning this one or at least I 'll try to exchange it in hopes that I get a good one .	-1
I was excited about this product because it 's the perfect compliment to the Disney Princess Songs Castle that my 15 month old loves , but I quickly became disappointed with it and my daughter became very bored with it 's limitations . On the positive side , the stable was relatively easy to put together and only required a screwdriver for one piece and the rest snapped together . It 's made of durable plastic and is very cutely decorated and comes with 2 horses/princesses ( Aurora and Rapunzel ) . My daughter does love watching the horses klip klop down the ramps , but becomes frustrated with the fact that the horses legs get stuck in the ridges of the ramp and the fact that on the ramp there 's a slide and the horses get stuck in that too.There really is n't much play option value in this other than the turn table that plays music while the horses sit on it and the horses ( sorta ) klopping down the ramps . The box boasts of music and lights but the only music that plays is at the front door slide and on the turn table . My biggest issue with it is that it 's bulky and if you want to play with the turn table , you have to turn the entire monstrosity around and if you want to play with the slide you have to turn the whole thing around again . I think the price ( about $ 40 ) is way too high for the limited amount of play options and that the cost of buying one additional horse/princess is also too high ( $ 10 ) . Yes watching the horse klop down is fun and cute for a while , but that 's where the amusement ends . If you 're looking for a versatile and fun Disney princess product , I recommend going withFisher-Price Little People Disney Princess Songs Palace . This is way more fun and the princesses talk/sing and my daughter loves it . This stable toy is just not up to par .	-1
I own another version of this Fisher Price farm toy ( without sounds ) that has much better quality than this toy . It is very cheaply made - the thickness of the plastic parts reminds me of toys that come in happy meals . Several of the parts are warped and do not fit together correctly . The whole product just feels cheap for $ 40 . I would expect to find a toy like this in a discount or dollar store for something like $ 5-10 . Other than the shoddy build , our kids are happy playing with it . The only pieces that are quality are the figures .	-1
I remember a different version of this farm when I was a kid . This one is boring though . My one year old is not interested at all . No room to play with the animals , annoying songs/noises that he ca n't even do on his own . Total bummer .	-1
This was our first step into the Little People toy world and I was really not impressed . My son is not a rough kid and loves to play with smaller toys , but every time he would bump into this or knock it over , it was coming apart . The `` pasture '' was also not well thought-out , as all he has to do is pick it up and it falls apart . I 've spent more time putting it back together these past few afternoons than anything else.The toy does n't hold his attention for very long either . I think , if the entire play set were purchased , rather than just this starter kit , more fun would be had , but these Little People toys are expensive ! I think we 'll be passing this onto a friend . No need to keep a toy around that he does n't find fun and I do n't enjoy having to constantly mess with.My recommendation ? Choose a different toy !	-1
While the farm is brightly colored and has cute animals , it is lacking in quality and durability . The plastic is rather thin and assembly is required for a few pieces . The fence is very flimsy and the ladder has to be attached with screws ( we left it off ) . The silo is suppose to be for storage of the animals and little man , but the door does not stay closed to keep them in . Over all very disappointed .	-1
My two-year old daughter got this as a Christmas gift . She loves the Fisher Price Little People , but this toy did not hold her attention like other toys in the princess collection . It is really cheaply made , and there is n't much to do . She lost interest in it almost immediately and has n't played with it much since we put it together . We also found that the latch to fold the castle together does n't align properly , so it 's very awkward to store and wo n't close . I would n't waste your money on this .	-1
Kind of disappointed in the & # 34 ; sunglasses & # 34 ; for any 18 & # 34 ; doll ! They do n't really look like sunglasses ... more like glasses because they 're not tinted ! My daughter was pretty upset ... as was I ! ! !	-1
Huge disappointment - flimsy design . Cars didnt stay charged . Sent it back . Dont waste your money . Very disappointed little boy .	-1
Frustration free packaging ? ! Yeah right ! ! It took me forever to get it open with scissors . And when I did , Doc did n't function properly . She just made a funny noise when you pressed the button . I asked to receive a replacement and return this one . It was going to take TWO WEEKS to get the replacement with & # 34 ; two day shipping. & # 34 ; I ended up cancelling the replacement . .Hopefully they do n't mess up my refund !	-1
Super cute doll but so many little malfunctions right out of the box . My girls found it very annoying that it was n't working the way it should and kept acting up . I had bought this exact doll in stores after ordering this one and both dolls and their pieces have malfunctions . So it was n't just the doll I got from amazon . Really a bummer for the price these are they act like they are made in a cheap factory with no quality control . But they do n't appear that way , they are solid built so it does n't make any sense .	-1
I bought this to replace another doctor 's kit that we had for my 3 year old . I was disappointed . As others have mentioned , the top is hard for littlies to open . All the piece are sparkly but do n't feel like the same quality as our earlier My Family Doctor set . I think I 'll look for another of those .	-1
While all the contents are getting good use I find that I am constantly having to put this lid back on . Every single time my daughter tries to open it she cant because its to hard to release and when I finally get it open for her the hinge pops out which is also just as difficult to put back together . It also does n't come in the box like it is displayed in when you purchase it . Instead it arrives in a plain brown box ... . pretty boring . I had to open it for my daughter to even get her interested in it . I would rather it have come in a cloth bag or something than this piece of junk . Would not recommend .	-1
My 2 year old daughter likes it , but she also liked her set from the dollar store just as well.Things that need to be improved : The bag is very narrow making it hard for little ones to put away all the tools independently.The stethoscope is *super* tight . My two year old wo n't put it in her ears because it hurts.The stethoscope makes all the sounds from the show and has some great Doc quotes , but it does n't have a heartbeat- duh !	-1
I bought this for my niece and not long after giving it to her the storage bag broke ! For the price I would expect a more durable product .	-1
During the 80 's while in high school , I became aware of the 'Superfriends ' cartoon on Saturday mornings . Faithfully , I watched every episode and even started to record them on my grandfather 's BETA player . He made me stop recording them when he found out I was recording over his 'happy time ' movies he and my grandma made with their camera.One of my favorite characters from that show was Solomon Grundy . He had a haircut similiar to my grandma.Often times , she would soak her feet in the tub , smoke a cigarette and read 'Reader 's Digest ' or some comic book to me.I prefered to use bubble bath most of the time so as not to see her toe nails . They often grew out thick and sideways while curving inward . Asside from that , she was an endearing lady whose raspy laugh was quite captivating if you could get past the strong smell of cigarettes and coffee with a hint of spearmint.Her passing a few years ago was quite a loss for my grandpa and I. Bless his heart for trying , he simply can not wash my back she did , but I would smile so as not to hurt his feelings.One day , I could tell he was feeling down . So , I went to the comic book shop to see what was new and maybe get something for him . That is when I beheld the biggest and quite possibly , the greatest Solomon Grundy action figure I have ever seen . As I made eye contact , I saw the image of my grandmother in him . Even the warm smile with the offset and discolored teeth captured her likeness . I knew that this figure would be just the thing he would need to cheer up.As I hurried home on my bike with the figure in my backpack , I could n't help but think how much he would like this figure . Maybe , he would even want to keep it in my room to share the joy.Leaving the bike on the front lawn , I ran up the porch steps , tripped on the lazy dog ( he had been sleeping for days ) and stumbled into the front room with the TV on where my grandpa was slumbering . Shaking him from his all afternoon nap , he woke up with me holding the boxed Solomon Grundy figure in his face shouting & # 34 ; it looks just like grandma does n't it ? ! & # 34 ; My grandpa passed away shortly after that from a heart attack.His final words were & # 34 ; y you b bastar ..* & # 34 ; Something to this day I wonder what he was trying to say every time I look at the figure in my room .	-1
it is ridiculous they would make R2-D2 , of all characters ! Come on , this is 2013 . R2-D2 comes from the 80s ! how much fun is this toy : 1/5 - minimal moving parts and features , almost a paperweight.educational value : 1/5 Are you kidding ? ? how durable is this toy : 1/5 Tiny parts that get lost and bent easilyoveral rating : 1/5 . doesnt take a genius to figure that out	-1
For the twenty dollars these SW Black Series figures cost you would think they might at least have offered some quality control regarding the paint , which on a figure this size is instantly apparent . The blue horizontal line around the R2D2 's head I purchased is completely skewed and his `` mood ring eyes '' are a mess of paint spatter . This is not acceptable.Regarding the sculpt , once again R2 's `` shoulders '' are too slim , a failing with the old 12 '' line version . Look at head-on pics from the films and then inspect the Black 6 '' figure : the top portion of his shoulder is wider than the long vertical panel on his torso in the film pics . In this 6 '' version , it is much slimmer and R2 looks less beefy . This totally alters the character 's look and appeal . His narrow shoulders look out of proportion to the rest of him.These are overpriced compared to other six inch scale figures by almost five dollars . I do n't see myself sticking with this series , a series which likely wo n't even have scaled vehicles - which is what makes the 3.75 inch figures so much fun.I 've been so thrilled with the `` vintage '' style smaller articulated figures , but these larger ones leave much to be desired . ******************************************************************************************Had the good fortune to find another two of these on the store pegs , but BOTH of them have the skewed line of blue paint around the circumference of R2 's head just like the one I purchased does ! ! ! UNACCEPTABLE !	-1
These Star Wars Black Series six inch figures look great in their packaging , but , once they 're out , all their deficiencies become obvious : First of all , the sculpts are n't terrific , in fact , their 3.75 '' counterparts look about as detailed . The characters gain nothing detail-wise in this scale . Second , the price is terrible unless you find it on sale . Hasbro also makes Marvel Legends which retail for four dollars cheaper . Third , the posability initially looks promising but a little time spent with the figure reveals that the addition of double jointed knees does nothing towards dynamic poses and the lack of double joints in the elbows crushes any further possibility.Even Boba Fett can not hold his blaster rifle properly in two hands.Lastly , there are elements in the body sculpt that impede this posability - ankles do not allow for the feet to turn up even slightly to make the figure crouch , armor elements on Fett and the Sandtrooper get in the way of them doing - well , just about ANYTHING besides stand at attention.This does n't make a lot of sense when you consider the recent Hasbro Marvel Legends which are capable of a great many dynamic poses and are often weighted properly so they can stand unaided . Hasbro has the team - why are n't they using them ? Essentially , if you must have these figures then do yourself a favor and leave them in the packaging where they 'll look great . If you mean to display them you 're in for a great disappointment .	-1

His front two solid sculpt belt-bags are completely in the way so you can not raise his leg up and forward ! This makes the double-joint in his knees useless . Moving his legs out sideways is the best you can do with him.Lastly , there are elements in the body sculpt that impede this posability - ankles do not allow for the feet to turn up even slightly to make the figure crouch , armor elements on Fett and the Sandtrooper get in the way of them doing - well , just about ANYTHING besides stand at attention .

This toy is sad . Get it if you want to collect but it is by far the ugliest action figure ever produced by hasbro . All of her joints are just poorly done and her neck sticks out at a jacked up angle like she merged with & # 34 ; the fly & # 34 ;	-1
If you 've seen this figure in person , you 'll know that you do n't want to bother with this one . The face is 10x worse than what the pictures show . As the overly generous 3 star reviewer says , it 's the one figure that is unlovable because it captures none of the facial features of Princess Leia . As a star wars fan , I was truly offended by this action figure . Whoever gave their okay to start production on this figure should be fired .	-1

Unlike other reviewers , I have this figure already . I love the idea of a 6 '' Stormtrooper , but I was very disappointed with it . Hasbro clearly just recycled the body of the ( excellent ) 6 '' Sandtrooper figure . This means that its neck is too long . The Sandtrooper had a longer neck because its helmet sat on top of a pauldron . However , on the Stormtrooper , it just makes him look like a giraffe . The helmet should sit much closer to the figure 's torso . For such an expensive figure , I 'd at least have hoped Hasbro would gotten the basics right . As it stands , I 'd pass on buying this figure until Hasbro fixes this mistake .	-1
This is the first Playbobil toy I have gotten my kids and I was really disapointed with it . It is n't very durable and the music it plays is pretty terrible . The little people are really poorly made and designed . The Instruments are cool but most will come apart and be lost in no time at all . I would look elsewhere for a toy . Note : while the music is bad , you can use a mp3 player with it to play your own music .	-1
There are technically two reviews for this product , the parent 's review and the kid 's review . The kids in the review are a three year old boy and twin five year old girls.As the parent I would give it just one star : * Age requirement is way off . The box states that it is not appropriate for children under 3 years . Given the high number of tiny parts that are easy to disassemble , the age requirement should be 6 years . * The kit did not come with all the pieces . There was only one drumstick and there was a missing guitar body ( only had the neck ) . * Never attempt to put this together with the kids helping . It may not make a difference , however , since as soon as the set was assembled my three children completely destroyed it within five minutes at most . * Like I stated earlier there were a high number of tiny parts . My impression was that some of the smaller pieces could have been molded into fewer larger pieces which would have simplified it from a setup perspective and made it safer for younger kids . * The guitar strap broke the first time I attempted to attach it to the guitar . * The stage seemed too small to hold all of the people and instruments . * It connected to an MP3 player and the sound was fine but it was not feasible to keep it connected since the younger kids would mess it up.If my children understood the star system they would have given it three stars : * They really liked the music that came along with it . I think it was just the idea that they could control it and it was fairly loud . * They liked being able to take it all apart and rearrange things . * They kept coming back to the set sporadically but it is not likely to carry any long term interest for them .	-1
Before you open the box , gather up 4 AA batteries and one of those tiny little Phillips-head screwdrivers . One of the screws holding my battery cover in place was in so tight that it took 4 different screwdrivers and the screw head is almost completely stripped now - I wo n't be screwing this back in too tightly , on the off chance that the batteries may die someday.The box is much , much bigger than the pieces require , so they rattled around a lot during shipping and the & # 34 ; stage & # 34 ; portion is pretty scratched up . I 'm sure my 5-year-old nephew wo n't care very much but it just seems like they 're trying to make you think you 're buying a much larger , more impressive toy than you actually get . Inside , the smaller pieces are divided into plastic bags in a way that makes no sense whatsoever - basically you need to open every single bag before you can assemble even one portion of the final toy . The packaging engineers at Playmobil need to buy a few pieces of Ikea furniture and take a lot of notes about how to package in a logical , space-saving way that follows the chronology of assembly . Ultimately it only took me about 55 minutes to assemble the whole thing ( about 15 of which involved wrestling the battery cover ) , but fortunately I did n't have my nephew over my shoulder impatiently demanding to play with it sooner . So if you 're getting this as a gift for someone , open 'er up and assemble it FIRST.The light feature is pretty cool , and the fact that you can broadcast your own music through the speakers is fun . The speakers are very cheap and sound tinny , but it is a pretty inexpensive toy so what can you expect . Unfortunately , kids today are accustomed to very sophisticated technology so I do n't know if my nephew will find that to be a cool thing for long or not . Fun idea though . It does come with two pre-loaded songs that are pretty awful , and the volume control has two settings : & # 34 ; not that loud & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; slightly louder. & # 34 ; Plugging in an mp3 player , iPod , etc , is very easy through a headphone jack connection ( which means you can use anything that has a headphone jack ) but integrating a small holder for your iPod or phone would be a handy improvement.Once assembled , the stage does look pretty cool and the instruments ( especially the guitars ) are great looking ! The band members , not so much . As others have mentioned , they 're all dudes , which is pretty outdated , and their outfits - OMG . Does the designer think that today 's kid 's love Def Leppard and Bon Jovi or what ? ? VERY dated , goofy outfits . Maybe current & # 34 ; rock bands & # 34 ; do dress like 1980 's AC/DC tribute clubs , but just in case , maybe Playmobil could offer some other & # 34 ; bands & # 34 ; to play on your stage , even include a little keyboard or DJ booth in the future . This has some potential for expansion , if your kid does n't break it first - everything feels a little flimsy but I suppose it all depends on how hard they want to rock out.Loved the idea of this , but am not too impressed with the execution .	-1
I got this for my 5 yr old Grandson , that has a couple of Transformers at home.This one was a waste of time , as the instructions are small drawings on a piece of paper , whichdid not give any directions how to put together . The pictures where light in color and it was hardto tell what fit together and what did not ! ! After trying to hook on the shield and a couple of cheap plastic parts , it was not much fun . One of the plastic parts wouldnot even hook in together.As far as making the truck and other fun things , this is suppose to do , they would not come together.It was hard to figure this out ! When my older grandkids came over , they even thought itwas frustrating ! This Beast Hunter Transformer got thrown in the big box and put away.Maybe in another year he might like it..As for now , NO..I gave it a two star for the work and colors that went into this toy ! Very disappointed .	-1
Disclosure : we are not a huge Transformers family . However , we 've had a few here and there and my younger son loves to build things and is a pro at building things from instructions all by himself -- he 's constructed probably a dozen 400/500+ piece Lego/K'Nex , etc , projects with virtually no help . So this is a kid who is very good at figuring out how things go and reading directions . Not this Transformer ! He found the directions to this extremely confusing and the plastic difficult to move/transform.I called in an expert : my engineering-loving teenaged son who spent some time with this toy only to dismiss it as `` crap . '' ( This teen has owned a number of transformers ) . He commented , for example , that the shield was stuck so hard into the fist that you feel like you 're going to break something simply by removing it . He lost patience before figuring out the transformation . So I took a turn . I have absolutely no idea what these instructions are trying to me . They have to be the most cryptic instructions on a construction toy I 've ever seen . I look at it and I feel like I understand what I 'm supposed to do , but when I try to do it the pieces do n't seem to go the way . We 've had this about a week now and we still ca n't make it go into a car.I had thought this would be a nice change-of-pace toy for my little 7 yo engineer , but I was really wrong . It 's too complex , too hard to physically pull out some of the pieces , and just does n't seem like a toy for children .	-1
Price . I prepaid for this several months ago for a Christmas present . Found it at costco for 79 $ ... Amazon said they would not help . Do n't get ripped off people .	-1
The title says it all . Do not spend your money on this product . It 's a piece of junk . I do n't know how this got any 5 star reviews but it 's definitely not worth such a high amount . First off it has a ton of stickers . It 's like lego made this or something . In vehicle or city mode it 's not very stable like another review said it 's too big for the box one of the arms has to be manually put on . And when you put on the stickers they either rip or do n't come off the sheet fully and the stickiness is left behind . Most of my stickers were mislabeled , meaning that the numbers did n't match the sheet . When I bought this i was very excited now I am just pissed I spent over $ 100 on a piece of junk like this . Everything was too loose hardly anything stayed where it was supposed to . I am not kidding people spend your money on something else a bunch of voyager or deluxe class transformers or something not even transformer related . DO NOT BUY THIS . I did n't even finish putting on the stickers before i sent it back . I can not stress this enough do not spend your money on this . I have never been so horribly disappointed in a product in all my life . Anyone who gives this 5 stars must be very patient or tolerant of crap . Back to the stickers you ca n't even fit your fingers where some of them go let alone see where they go . So to sum it up do not get this crap . Please pay attention to what I have said and spend , or save , your money elsewhere .	-1
As the subject says the toy itself is nice but I preordered over a month in advance . During that time Amazon continued to show available for preorder and never made it known that they would have stock issues . When it came out I waited over a week then contacted Amazon who had it showing in stock fulfilled by Amazon for other sellers but still had not shipped . They said they could n't tell any estimate on how long before they would get to my order or even how many outstanding preorders were still out there . When I closed the chat utterly frustrated I ordered from the Hasbro website and got it there instead . 9 minutes after I had just got off the chat with an Amazon supervisor who repeatedly said Amazon did not have any stock , I received an email from Amazon saying it shipped.So , I waited to receive them from both places since I collect and the one that came from Amazon had a slightly beat up box . The one from Hasbro came in perfect condition . Both were delivered by FedEx and the outside boxes were fine so the problem appeared to be on Amazon 's side.While I know a lot of the complaint is more with Amazon than the toy itself ( which is pretty awesome ) the buying experience is a big part of what makes you happy with the toy . As a result I went from super excited about it coming out to being extremely frustrated with how the situation was handled and ultimately receiving a beat up box .	-1
I was not impressed with the Darth Vader Figure because it did n't talk ... I thought that it was going to say a few words ... .It was a nice size and my grandson liked the figure ... .but paying that much for a doll ... .not good ... .	-1
There 's a lot to like about LeapFrog 's `` Read with Me , Scout '' , but you 'll quickly discover that Scout is no replacement for reading a book with your little one in your lap . This is true for parents AND ( more importantly ) the kiddos.Scout 's got a lot of tech crammed into him , much more than your average squeezable , interactive plush toy . Set up is a snap ( we had Scout unboxed with the help of a scissors in less than 3 minutes ) . You begin by pressing a color coded button on Scout 's collar that corresponds to the cover the chosen book . He 's got a pleasant ( but somewhat on the loud side ) voice that sings songs , giggles when hugged , asks your child questions that relate to the story being read ( e.g . : `` Do you feel happy or sad ? When you feel grumpy , what helps you feel better ? `` ) , and of course reads one of five stories . You can pat Scout on the head to move along with the story or follow one of his other instructions ( e.g . : `` Pat my cheek to hear my elephant sound ! `` ) .The interactive portions are above average in their creativity compared to other similar products on the market . Nonetheless , you 'll still get what you pay for . This is n't a supercomputer that has infinite variability and/or artificial intelligence . After one time through each book , the rapport starts to sound very repetitive . Kids pick up on this nearly as quickly as the adults who wish Scout was in another room . The replay value is therefore limited , which you 'll soon discover after you 've burned through the five short board books.The first time we played with Scout , play time lasted just over 15 minutes before my 4-year-old moved on to the bubble wrap he came packed in . ( Honestly , it held his attention almost as long . ) Play time has diminished since to the point where Scout is a nearly forgotten afterthought in our home.It 's easy for me to say , since I received Scout courtesy of the Vine program , but I can not recommend this highly enough : Take the money you 're thinking about spending on Scout , supplement your child 's library with quality picture books , and enjoy some precious reading time ... together .	-1
This is such a mysteriously awful product , it 's hard to encapsulate in words . Somehow it annoys well beyond what you would expect . Expect the tinny , poor quality sound . Expect irritating jingles . Expect it to feel light and even cheaper than you imagine possible.Be amazed at its remarkable resilience , because despite me trying to break it , it has resisted . I have stood on it , dropped it , and spilled water on it , and nothing seems to kill it.It 's like a zombie that plays octopus jam band tunes- the worst kind .	-1
My two-year child played with this a bit , but ultimately neither she as a child nor I as a parent cared for it . The thing is not very touch sensitive , for one ; it kept telling her to `` touch the tombone ! '' and when she or I would touch the trombone ... nothing happened , except a few seconds later it told us to `` touch the trombone ! '' Rinse , repeat five more times , and I turned the thing off . It is never silent , never just lets the kids make noise ; it wants to give them `` directed fun '' or something . Ugh .	-1
My daughter lives for music . At the slightest hint of a song anywhere , on screen , in the car , off the ipad , she 's up and dancing and singing . Any toy of hers that makes music is never far , except this one . She played with it for about 15 minutes , and has n't looked at it again . I think a few factors may be the cause:1. its not intuitive - its a flat panel toy , and different parts of the surface produce music when pressed . the only hint that a given surface produces music is the graphics on the panel . unlike most music-making toys that have graphic AND a 3 dimensional design to indicate an engaging surface , there 's not much to direct the player 's attention . yes , the graphics are quite cute , but there was no tactile response that involved my daughter ( unlike pressing a button ) . i suppose this is a bit surprising , given her ipad ( practically glued to her ) doens't have a tactile response either , but it does n't work for her.2 . sound quality - is awful . the embedded speaker is very low quality , and the sounds are muffled , with little audio fidelity . i 'm not expecting ipad-like sound quality ( itself not great , but light years ahead of this one , albeit at orders of magnitude more cost ) , but the sound was so weak that it was hard to discern the different instruments.3 . my daughter is 3 , which is the beginning of the recommended age range for the product . it didnt hold her interest at all , but it makes me wonder whether they should revise the range down . perhaps its more simple design would better appeal to a 2 y/o or so .	-1
I got this thinking that my 14 month old could not only handle it , but would embrace the smooth tactile-less 'ipad-esque ' non features . Maybe that was failure on my part , since he is well under the 3+ age range listed on the packaging . But , he loves the ipad or any phone he can get his hands on , so I thought this would be a good alternative.However , the smooth surface , while very responsive , does n't give any visual feedback , ( except for a few lights that light up ) . So lack of visual combined with lack of tactile , does n't equal up to an engaging toddler toy . And my toddler simply was n't interested , all he did was lift it up , set it down , slap at it and then walked away . No matter how many times I try to get him to enjoy it , he seems bored . It 's cute , it has lights , it has no hold over his attention.The sounds are kinda cute at first , but quickly become an unbearable loop when you , or your child , are n't pressing on the correct answer or if it 's being used in the free play 'compose ' mode . And I think that 's where the biggest failure comes in , it 's hard for a disinterested child to realize the cause and effect of his actions on this toy , it 's playing music practically non stop making it hard , to practically impossible , to tell which sounds you did pressing say the piano key , unless you know to listen for it , ( and you know a small child is n't , well , not mine anyway ! ) .Unless you try this in person I would look for a different music option , I think the idea far outweighs the actual product . Maybe in another year I 'll pull it out and give it another try . But , I have a feeling even with age on his side there will still be far more engaging options .	-1
The minimum age for this product is 3 years old , so I had a reasonable expectation that it would be fun for a just-turned-four-year-old . Not so.Overall , I think it 's an interesting idea . It lies flat , and is probably easier to transport than a keyboard or drum form factor . It is inspired by tablet computing . However , the lack of knobs and keys made it difficult for my child to grasp its purpose.When I showed him how it was used , he said it was a boring toy . This is a boy that loves music , that likes to dance , play with a real drum and ukelele . After seeing this toy , he asked me if we could use the REAL keyboard ( a synthesizer I own ) instead.Overall the product felt like it was trying too hard to be educational.If marketed at very young children - 1-3 - it might be a good toy .	-1
The top surface of this toy is smooth . There 's no way to see or feel where the 'buttons ' are to activate various features . Granted , it 's pretty forgiving . You can tap anywhere on the animals , anywhere on the keys , to make sounds . But after a few seconds of watching a kid trying to tap the light next to the drum kit instead of the drum kit itself , even i was frustrated.As with most LeapFrog toys , the voices are shrill and it defaults to being noisy and pestering . With a few taps , you can make it quiet so your child can explore the different musical notes and sounds , but unless you do , it 's just an endless loop of noise.There are three modes , 'Compose ' , 'Song ' , and 'Game'.Compose is a sort of free-for-all . It starts with the 'guitar ' loop playing , and kids can bang on the keys or the animals-with-instruments to add more noise.Song encourages kids to touch the different instruments to hear little samples of sound , or they can touch an animal-with-instrument to play a song . ( Now this would have been a great opportunity to actually teach something . If , for example , the keys lit up to show which note was being played in the song . But no , it just plays a song like 'twinkle twinkle ' . ) Game involves the device telling the user to touch a certain color . There are pretty much only two options - the key of that color , or the animal/instrument of that color . The device then tells the kid what they touched ( the key color , the animal name , the instrument ) , and starts again . Given that there are only 8 keys , 6 animals , and 4 instruments , the options are limited.There 's pretty much nothing this toy does that is n't done by every other toy on the market these days . Hit a button , hear a song . The only interesting education option , using the playing song to teach a little basic keyboarding , is n't one of the features.And in a bid to lighten the toy or lower the cost by reducing the material requirements , the back of the toy is mostly empty space with thin plastic bands for structural support . While not actually sharp , they do dig into a kid 's lap if they 're wearing shorts instead of long pants . I 'll post a picture of this ( the toy , not the red lines of my child 's legs after using it ) .If you want your kid to experiment with music , get them a keyboard . There are some pretty cheap , pretty good ones on the market these days that actually do teach kids how to play some simple songs . If you just want more noise in your life , this one 'll do .	-1
Who ? Why , you are scruffy lookin ' Black Series Biker Scout ! When I was a kid ( over thirty years ago ) , Star Wars was one of my favorite things . It 's been that way ever since I saw Luke , Leia , Han , and Chewie take on the Galactic Empire on the small screen in the first film . I actually saw the original film in the theater , but I was literally just a few months old . It was n't until `` The Empire Strikes Back '' came out that I got to see my heroes ( and villains ) in all of their glory . When `` Return of the Jedi '' was released , I could n't wait to see what new adventures the Rebel Legion would have and George Lucas made sure that I left the theater a fat and happy kid.As most of you know , tons of new creatures were introduced such as the Ewoks and the denizens of Jabba 's Palace . A new type of trooper was introduced in that film as well , the Biker Scout . They wore more cloth than their Stormtrooper brethren , and rode on those really cool speeder bikes . I fell in love with the look of these troops immediately.Being the eager lad that I was , I asked my mom if she would buy me a Biker Scout toy and she complied . All these years later , I still have that figure . When I saw that Hasbro 's Black Series would include a Biker Scout , I figured it was time for me to get the newer model . All I have to say is that it was a huge let down.The figure 's paint scheme is terrible . The joints on the feet and shoulders are black , cutting into the pristine white I 'm used to seeing ( and which Kenner got correct on the original figure ) . Also , while I appreciate the multiple points of articulation , many of them are extremely loose . On top of that , the plastic casing was hanging off of the cardback when I received the figure . Now , this particular problem is not exclusive to the Biker Scout or the Black Series . The Saga Legends and Mission Series plastic casings are also poorly adhered to their respective cardbacks in the 2013 run of Hasbro 's Star Wars line . Still , it 's disappointing to see on what is supposed to be one of Hasbro 's higher end figures.The only accessory ( which I do n't actually mind a lack of ) is the Biker Scout 's blaster . It sort of fits in his boot holster but I had a hard time getting it to stay in his hand . It kept popping out no matter how I tried to maneuver it around in the hand.Overall , I wanted to love this figure , but poor articulation , horrible paint , and bad packaging make this a figure I 'm glad to have purchased at a heavily discounted price . If you feel like modifying this figure ( as in painting it to match the screen version ) , go ahead and buy it , but I would try to get it at a deep discount if I were you . Parents buying this solely for their children to play with might have better luck , just watch out for the flimsy articulation.Bummed out over this one .	-1
for the little cousins into star wars , if you find this cheap then jump on itif not , its not worth it	-1
I love Darth Vader . I love Empire Strikes Back . That is the only reason I bought this figure . I wanted the blaster effect for the hand . It is NOT worth $ 10 . If you do n't have a Vader or you want the effect , grab it . Otherwise , there are better and cheaper versions of this figure out there .	-1
Little did we realise there was a problem with the standard vintage collection sized x-wing pilot figure ( like Wedge ) : it 's too small , just measure it against any R2 unit ( who stand up to their necks ! ) . But the figures were nice and poseable and the removable helmets were cool so no one complained.But this new Biggs figure corrects the size issue at the expense of looking ridiculously tall against the rest of your Red and Gold Squads - I mean he 's huge , like Chewbacca huge by comparison . Actually , if you stand him next to the recent TVC Bespin Han Solo he 's about even.What I want to know is , why did they decide to change NOW that they 've made all the other x/y wing pilots this size ? Thanks again , Hasbro ...	-1
It looks very nice , but the lightsaber and headress comes off when moving the figure . The robe is pretty flimsy and will tear easily . But , again , the face looks great . The printing was very good .	-1
Wel , actually the 1995 figure had 6 points of articulation ... so he 's more of a throwback to 1977 without the retro charm . Hasbro claims to be selling these to kids , but aside from my 2 year old , nobody else ever chooses the & # 34 ; Block-O-Vader & # 34 ; over my more articulated ones . Easy pass unless you have to own every single Star Wars figure ever made . Like me. & # 34 ; DO N'T BUY IT & # 34 ; - to all the Aunts , Uncles and Grandparents . Get them the Vintage Collection or Black Series version instead .	-1
Not what I expected , and the heat seal was missing . The figure was dangling in the box . Not sure what has been going on with Amazon 's QA	-1
I would not buy this again . The snails that go with it are great , but the truck fell apart way too quickly . Terrible quality .	-1
The subtle green on green squares are difficult for my 3 year old to distinguish when counting spaces . It 's also hard to tell which direction you should be moving . The bases for the game pieces are quite large and makes multiple people in a square or nearby squares hard to fit . The spinner is cheap too . I think I 'll be take the advice of another reviewer and switching the spinner for a single die and find better/smaller pieces for the game tokens . I 'll try it a few more times with my young son before deciding if it 's actually more fun than frustrating to play .	-1
My girls enjoy beading and jewelry , so I thought we 'd give this a try . I 'm less than impressed.The heart of this thing is a flat , plastic paddle on a spinner . It allows to whirl around clay to make a swirled effect . I think you could do the same thing between your hands and it would be easier . The paddle itself is a little awkward to operate , and it is really very simple.The kit comes with air hardening modeling clay and some jewelry making supplies . You could just buy these things separately - which is what I 'd recommend .	-1
Let 's be honest : this does n't really make jewelry , in the sense of `` pretty accessories that someone would actually wear or that you could give to a friend as a gift they will enjoy . '' The creative process is fun , no doubt , but the end product is chintzy junk that will instantly be eaten and thrown up by your dog or end up clogging your vacuum . Eventually it will make its way into its permanent resting place : the landfill . Not at all worth it . There are so many crafts you can do for less money , with less waste .	-1
This is going to sound really mean , but the whole time my daughter and I were using this , we both kept saying & # 34 ; this is stupid & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; this is really stupid. & # 34 ; The spinner in the center of the station makes dradle shaped beads . You 're supposed to put the beads on the spokes to dry . While trying to but the beads onto the spokes , you end up mushing the bead some , no matter how careful you are . Some of the clays are more foam like , while others ( particularly neon green ) are very sticky and gummy and hard to work with.The accessory pieces to make the pendants etc are very cheap/dollar store kids jewelry-like . I am not sure what girl over the age of maybe 6 or 7 would want to actually of the finished pieces of jewelry . I am thinking that may even be too old . The girl on the box is definitely way too old and I assure you that in real life , she would never wear any of these . You could probably make some beads that are wearable without the accessories and decorations , but then most of the kit is a waste.I hate to give such bad reviews , but this set is just bad . No matter what you do , the beads end up messed up in some way after you form them , due to the texture of the clay and how easy it is to mush.The glaze makes them look kinda neat , but again , still nothing a girl over 5 or 6 would wear . Very juvenile looking and cheap.I would recommend buying supplies separately at the craft store . You would have a great variety of great quality supplies that a girl would actually want to wear .	-1
The idea behind this toy is interesting , but it fails in execution . There is a purple gel behind a plastic covering that you displace with a stylus or with your fingers . ( I am not so sure that this mess-free toy will remain mess-free . I am not going to try to break the cover , but it certainly does n't seem like it would take much . A little bit of effort from a curious kid will most likely result in a mess of purple goo . ) Because you are using pressure displacement to draw , it 's hard to actually draw and it 's hard to clear the screen.I think I could have about as much fun with a little bit of corn syrup , food coloring and a zip-lock bag ... .	-1
My 3 year old was really interested in this for about an hour . She thought I had given her an iPad , and doodled on it a little bit . Then she realized it was n't an iPad and nothing she draws on it comes out very well . That was the end of that , and it has been under the coffee table with a dump truck parked on top of it ever since .	-1
My toddler loves to draw , so I was very excited about this toy and hoped that it would live up to my expectations . It does have a lighted background which she can change between colors and it will play child-friendly music , but it is a terrible drawing toy . The surface of the pad is a gel-filled tablet and you can squish shapes into it with either your fingers or the provided stylus . Unfortunately , the gel seems to move rather freely so that once you have pressed a line into place , the gel oozes back over it almost immediately.The only way we managed to get any drawings to stay on the board for any length of time was drawing on it when it happened to get let in a rather chilly room overnight . The next morning , simple drawings with widely spaced lines would stay visible for longer periods of time . But I 'm sure prolonged exposure to the cold would ruin the electronics inside.The toddler likes to scribble on it , but seems to get frustrated that her pictures disappear and often ends up abandoning it in favor of traditional crayons and paper .	-1
My kids ( 2 and 4 years old ) LOVE the magna doodle drawing things that are similar to this one , so I thought they would love this , but not so much . It has purple gel inside of it , which looks cool when it 's lit up , but b/c it works by the gel simply being displaced when you `` draw '' you ca n't really write/draw anything . When you push down w/ the pencil or your finger , the gel just squishes to another part of the surface and erases the parts of the line previously drawn . This was very frustrating b/c my kids wanted to draw a big , cohesive pic , but could n't . The lights and songs are OK , but get really annoying after a while . Overall , we were n't impressed and wo n't be using this as a regular play time toy in our house.I would recommend this for toddlers who love to draw : Classic Doodler With 2 Stampers , Classic Purple	-1
i bought this for my son and the gel is already crusty and has like air bubbles like its been leaking or evaporating over time . It does n't show lines good either . It is just an all around crap toy do n't waste your 20.00 on it . I have never been disappointed in crayola products and I have been using them since I was a kid . This was in fact a total disappointment . I wish I lived closer to Target because I would return it and get my money back	-1
This product requires too much pressure , so much that I can barely draw anything on it myself . It worked so poorly that we ended up throwing it away after trying my different times to get it to work properly .	-1
My daughter liked this for 30 minutes and then it was never touched again . I think it was due to just the novelty of drawing on a squishy gel ( the product is just a gel covered with a plastic type cover ) and the fact that you cant draw much of anything on it . I 'm not sure how they made that sun picture on the product image and i cant get anything close to it , so dont expect anything of that quality . But i think it a decent , cheap , and durable toy for a small toddler to waste some time on .	-1
The pictures on the box show children who have supposedly successfully drawn pictures on the color pad . And those pictures are clear , vibrant , and stay long enough for a photographer to snap a picture.There is only one explanation ... those children are Wizards ! My own , perfectly normal , non-magical child could n't draw a clear picture on this thing to save her life . Immediately upon using either the included stylus , her fingers , or any other thing around the house that we tried to draw with , we noticed that most of the time it is impossible to even draw a clear line - and in most cases , the gel refills any lines immediately . However , being an industrious child , she immediately grabbed some markers and decorated the boring white frame that surrounds the gel pad.I imagine that an infant might be fascinated by the texture , the lights , and the music . And an infant ca n't draw anything anyway , so would n't be disappointed if their drawing suddenly disappeared or never appeared at all.However , if you have a child who likes to draw and likes to actually see their drawings stay in place for more than a split second , you will likely have a child who is very disappointed with this product.However , if your child is either an infant or a Wizard ( or an infant Wizard ! ! ! ) , you may enjoy this one . * Two Stars simply for use by infants ( or Wizards ) .	-1
This is yet another Crayola review I write , with two kids and the older ( 6 years old ) being a huge Crayola fan , this should not come as a surprise . How does this product perform then ? For starters , the selling point is that this is designed for small hands and it is also mentioned this is supposed to be `` mess-free '' . Well , the size of the pad is just about perfect for a toddler , but it did feel just about right for my older kid ( 6 ) How does this work ? after installing three AA batteries ( not included , so keep that in mind if you get this ) you should be good to go . On the back of the pad there is an ON/OFF switch where you can select if you want color lights or color lights with music . Just to give you an idea we do not use the music at all , it is just too loud and there is no volume control to change that , also , like with any other similar toys , it gets repetitive and eventually , annoying.The way this is built so it is mess-free , is that the pad is made of a dark blue gel covered by a thin plastic layer , so by using the included stylus you basically draw by removing the gel . This is very practical and clean but as you can imagine , frustrating : since the pad is made out of gel , it is practically impossible to draw without the figures deforming . Also , once you 've used it , there is no easy way to restore the gel completely . You have to manually spread the gel , making all kinds of shapes with your hands in the process.After watching my kids play with this for a while I came to the following conclusion : younger kids ( 1-2 years old ) may feel drawn to the music and colors but not actually use it as intended . Older kids who could use it to actually draw things may end up frustrated because of the issues caused by the consistency of the gel on the screen . I guess what I am trying to say is that this may work better as a baby toy , but there are better baby toys out there than this one.I am giving this item two stars , but I will also say there are other Crayola products you can get on the same price range that may suit your needs better.One final comment , anyone else noticed how Amazon warns about the choking hazard and mentions this is not for kids under 3 ? I mention this because the box in which this comes has a huge sign on the front suggesting this for 24+ months kids . The only choking hazard I could find was the stylus and yeah , I put the thing away from my younger kid .	-1
The only real plus for this product is that it 's mess free , but that does n't matter much if no one wants to play with it . Little ones can use their fingers to make a design on the gel-like substance or use the stylus that 's provided . There are six colors and different music that plays along with each color . Neither of my boys seemed to care too much about these features . My oldest boy ( 3.5 years old ) loves doing crafts , but has n't been at all interested in this toy . After several weeks , it 's gotten almost no playing time . In my opinion , it 's bit of a dud .	-1
I was really expecting this toy to be more functional . The drawing disappears almost immediately . As an example , my 3 1/2 year old daughter tried to draw a simple face . She drew 2 eyes , a nose , and then the mouth . By the time she had drawn the mouth , the eyes had disappeared . After playing it for about 5 minutes , she proclaimed it `` broken '' and asked me to fix it for her.I thought that perhaps I had gotten a defective unit , but after reading some of the reviews here , it is just how the toy works . Cute idea , poor execution . We 'll stick to using a Magna Doodle , which has stood the test of time .	-1
I tested this with a 3 year old and an 8 year old . The 8 year old quickly discarded it , but she is probably not the target audience for a toy like this anyway . The 3 year old was fascinated with the colors and the ability to draw with his fingers . However , the images quickly faded or became distorted , which confused our little artist . We then changed how we presented the toy and instead of suggesting he draw pictures , we took turns drawing gibberish and watching it change . That was a little better , but not entertaining enough . I thought the music was annoying , but he liked it.I wish it worked as described , because it could have been a lot of fun for him . Overall , we found this toy to be disappointing and unimpressive . It will go on a shelf in the toy closet where I 'm sure it will sit , unrequested , for a long time .	-1
As a marketing professional , I bring a critical perspective to products that others might see in a much simpler light . Take a crayon case , for example . Crayola , the KING of crayons , thought consumers would love a case to hold 152 crayons . I thought my kids would love it , too . After receiving it and trying it out , I can not help but think of all the cool things this case could have been , rather than just a yellow hunk of plastic that holds crayons.I normally like to point out all the great things about products , but this is an exception . Other than holding 152 crayons , this case really does not offer much . Instead , I will focus on all the things YOU WILL NOT FIND with this product , that would have been really neat.THINGS I WISH THIS CASE OFFERED , BUT IT DOES NOT:1 . Spinning/Carousel Base : It is impossible for a little one to see all the crayons that are arranged to face 4 different directions around the center of the case . So , why not make the case rotate , rather than making the kid walk around it or pick up the entire case ? 2 . Grouping/Organization : Rather than 152 colors dispersed somewhat randomly , why not use the case to help bring some sort of organization to the colors ? For instance , there is one box that is full of metallics . There is another box full of glitter crayons . However , the only way I knew this was by pulling out the individual crayons and using deductive reasoning . Why not label the groups and do more groups to help make sense of such a large assortment ? 3 . A Lid with a Clasp : There is a very cheap plastic lid with this case that I am certain will be discarded by most purchasers who think it is simply packing material -- not worthy of keeping for the long haul . However , if you do n't keep that cheap piece of plastic , then you have NO LID AT ALL . It would have been nice if they had thought about a case of crayons that will almost certainly be transported by a little one who might drop it.4 . Cooler Sharpener : This case has a sharpener , but it is inconveniently located in the middle of the case , and it is sunken down low . It really is n't even all that easy to see . Then , to sharpen a crayon , a kid must hold the crayon vertically and turn it . Sure , all of this is possible , but with a big case like this , a better solution could have been designed that is easier to access and use.5 . Refill Friendly Design : My kids use washable crayons , which do not come with this case . However , the only way that I could put their crayons into this case would be to buy 16-count boxes of crayons , as this case is really only designed to hold that size of box ( actually , there is one box in the case that holds 24 , but the rest hold 16 crayons ) . Practically speaking , the life of this case is going to be pretty short if it is not easy to refill with one 's own crayons down the road.In summary , if you are just looking for a throw-away plastic case full of 152 crayons , then this product is for you . If , on the other hand , you are hoping for a case that is designed to stand the test of time and provide some unique and useful features and benefits for your little ones , you 'll be disappointed like me .	-1
My young daughter is a big fan of products such as this , and even takes orders from her classmates for the creation of custom jewellery.Unfortunately , this product was a disappointment for her - the instructions were just too vague ( even with me helping ) and the product too cumbersome - to come out with any keepers.~A_E~	-1
Let me start out by saying I am of the shrinky-dink generation - and puffy paint - and paper mache masks using white glue and newspapers ( or globes using a balloon if you want to get fancy ) . I would like to believe that I am somewhat able to succeed at a kid craft especially when under the direction of a cool-under pressure able-to-whittle 9 year old , but I failed at this - mostly because I found it frustrating . The offspring persevered and was rewarded with some color swirl blobs pierced through the center and placed on the Peacock stand alongside my puce colored beauties . They had lovely puce color variations within though.Getting started:1 ) The Peacock stand was assembled by the offspring in about 45 seconds sans instructions . It was simple and keeps the bead holes open while they dry . I have no complaints about the Peacock stand aside from the fact it is now adorning my dining room buffet alongside her mantids and their required fruit flies . So yes , keep in mind this requires drying and space for drying ... and may end up living in space you did not intend to populate with kid stuff.2 ) The roller apparatus is preassembled . We were up and running in under 5 minutes . We are girls who appreciate instant gratification and were happy with unpacking and mostly lack of extra packing materials ( although I wish they used reclosable bags for the supplies ) 3 ) Kit components include pink , blue , yellow , and purple clay , some pendant holders , clay punches , a device for hole poking , plastic clunky bracelet clasps , elastic and string ( I am not clearly not employed in marketing ) .4 ) The instructions are ... minimal ... and clearly supposed to be written for the offspring 's benefit ( about a 3rd grade reading level , laid out fairly nicely ) except they bounce around a lot ( e.g . if you are making a swirl bead do steps 1-2 for regular beads , then swirl , then repeat steps 3-4 ... ) - flattening position versus rolling position could have used a picture for the younger crowd . No instructions for round ( obvious ) and square ( obvious enough for us , but maybe not for a younger child ? ) beads . A couple ok project ideas.5 ) I like the clay . It is vibrant and soft ; it is not so messy or crumbly ( just be aware of the `` may permanently stain ! '' warning when choosing location ) .Making stuff:1 ) We decided by committee that the pendants were clunky . Most of this decision arrived from why do you have to flatten with the roller then smoosh it in the pendant holder . Pointless - and clunky . We did not like clunky . However , these are easy enough to make , but remember there are only a few.2 ) Onto beads : 1 ) choose 2 colors 2 ) Use hole in crank arm of roller to size the pieces 3 ) roll the pieces and align them 4 ) turn roller to standing position 5 ) insert clay in back and crank away from you 6 ) put roller flat 7 ) put flattened clay in back and roll out - in theory the flattened piece will hit the bottom roller , push against it and coil ... . which brings us to 8 ) take flattened coil out , repeat 7 , repeat 8 ... 9 ) eventually put pressure on bottom roller have some success albeit with now puce clay 10 ) realize pressure did not work and manually start coils 11 ) realize it was easier ( and less error/offset coils ) to just roll by hand . 12 ) punch hole ( no problems here but hole is big ) and 13 ) add to peacock rack to dry3 ) Embossing clay : there are pretty designs lightly etched on the sides of the roller apparatus . According to the instructions you can use this to emboss your coils . However ... they are so subtle that no matter how we tried the result in the clay was faint as to hardly see and then was marred as soon as we touched it . It could be there is a magic time during the hardening process that you can properly emboss the clay without cracking it using too much force . However , if this was meant for embossing the design should have been more prominent.6 ) Glazing : subtle sheen and glitter . No problems - it is drippy so plan accordingly . The peacock holder was helpful for glazing . Clear nail polish with added glitter I think would be cool to try.Bottom line : I think there few supplies included for what you actually get - although I was for whatever reason enamored with the stand ( it did not tip over and it actually worked ) . This is more of a `` getting started '' pack , but I could easily see a crafter using these up in one sitting . I found the coiling frustrating using the roller . The roller is good for flattening . I asked the offspring what she thought and she said it was fun to do with me but she thought it was kind of dumb and not anything she would wear ( so maybe 9 too old ? ) . She did not think this would be a good gift for her friends or her younger cousin ( 6 ) . She thought her younger cousin would not be able to follow the directions and would not be able to roll the beads . Maybe so . Maybe not . YMMV . So for us , this was not a win as a rolling pin , toothpick , and better jewelry supplies would have gotten better results for less money . It is not worth the current list price . So , bottom line - no I would not recommend this unless the roller is modified so that it can grab clay better and has deeper embossing indentations . Then ... maybe for the 4-7 crowd .	-1
This kit is a set of clays , glazes , and rollers , together with some plastic mounting lockets for clay . The general idea is that kids use the rollers to roll clay ribbons into tulip shaped beads , punch holes in them , glaze and dry them , to make colorful flower beads and other accessories.I 'm not sure if this kit is a good fit for many kids , though . It 's recommended for ages eight and up , but my eight year old found it frustrating , and the best case scenario for the jewelry probably wo n't appeal to kids much above eight . I think it 's worth a try if an adult is able to give a *lot* of help , but otherwise , might go for a different clay or jewelry kit .	-1
Unfortunately this is another Crayola craft project I have to give the thumbs down . I am disappointed at how cheap and cheezy the jewelry from this kit is . It 's frustrating to work with , but it would be ok if the results were at least something you could enjoy . They really are n't . For the price charged you would think they could come up with something a little better than this .	-1
It 's barely an ok set . You would be better off buying your own clay and just rolling the beads yourself . It would be cheaper and you would get much more clay and colors . 4 small foil packs of clay are included . The glitter paint that is included in this set smells strongly of ammonia . My daughter pointed that out to me right away . She said it smells like glass cleaner , but it was the ammonia smell that she was referring to . You could substitute glitter nail polishes instead , if you 'd like , if you decide to buy your own supplies instead of this kit.The clay takes a long time to dry and the finished products are n't very cute and look extremely juvenile . This is definitely a set for the younger girls.The press/roller gadget is smaller than you 'd think and does n't do very much at all . It would be quicker and easier to roll out dough with a small rolling pin , which could be picked up for a dollar . The device does not do anything except roll out the dough flat.The picks to poke through the beads to let them dry and add the hole for the string/ribbon are about the most useful part of the set , but again , you could definitely substitute with something else..wooden kabob skewers for example.Of course this set is more cute and colorful than just buying all of your own supplies and makes for a better presentation in terms of gift giving . I would say the younger girls ( ages 4-8 maybe ) would be the most satisfied with it . The color , designs and types of beads that this set makes have a really & # 34 ; young & # 34 ; look to them . An older girl would not actually want to wear them , and I do n't think they would have much fun creating the jewelry with just the items that are included in this set . I really feel like this would appeal more to 4 - 6 year olds , actually.The charms/pendants that are included look really cheap and cheesey . All you really do with them is stick clay in the inlaid part - there 's not much more you can do . There are little studs then that you can poke into the center and they stay raised away from the pendant and clay.This set is really a let down and is way over priced . I feel bad to give it just one star , so I gave it two because I am sure it will appeal to SOMEONE out there , and it seems to be of good quality , but honestly I would have to recommend to pass on this unless you 're buying for a little girl in the 4-6 year old range . I can not see an older child being interested in it or liking the finished products .	-1
My 10year old daughter really loved this when she first saw it . Unfortunately the product itself didnt live up to its hype . Her complaints included the following : the finished product is ugly , the bead roller was mostly useless , the clay didnt harden well and broke , and the glitter didnt stick onto the clay properly.When i asked her if she 'd buy some more of the model magic clay with her allowance she said no . Thats pretty telling to me and why i dont recommend this product .	-1
Crayola has the sort of elementary nostalgic branding that recalls first boxes of crayons . It is a successful brand that spans generations , and that typically be counted on to both encourage and entertain . So why they would slap the Crayola brand on this dud , I ca n't even speculate . The Crayola Light up Dry Erase set , is a dry erase board that is backlit . It also includes eight crayons . Here 's some of the issues my eight year old and I identified with this toy : -The dry erase crayons are hard to erase . It takes some effort ! Even once done , some traces remain permanently . Although it preserves your drawing longer , it defeats the purpose of a draw erase board.-Complicated . My kid is fairly intuitive and builds Lego toys and models and assembles her own toys most often . Yet she needs assistance setting up this toy . There are a lot of pieces involved in the set up and you have to align the thing just so to switch backgrounds ( from black to white ) .-4 AA batteries , required , not included . Batteries should be included on all toys period . No problem replacing , big problem obtaining 4 batteries to even to begin to use the toy.-Inferior quality . The frame is cheap flimsy plastic and the white board itself is cardboard.-The sizing is off . The crayons are jumbo and the screen is smaller than a sheet of paper , so you ca n't really do much more than doodle . Smaller crayons ( orthin markers ) OR a larger board would have been better.-Not a lot of fun . This one is subjective , but my child spent more time setting up the board then actually playing with it.In the end , your doodle does look kind of cool once backlit , but my kid and I agree , it is n't worth the effort .	-1
The pieces do n't fit together well , and the lights are pretty lame . Holding it all together while the kids played with it proved to be more than they wanted to deal with . They ended up drawing one time looking at it with the dim lights and grew quickly bored . The lights do n't shine over the whole board , so they become almost secondary . The drawing surface and backdrop keep sliding around and do n't lock into place . Overall , this is n't a very well conceived toy .	-1
The Crayoloa Dry Erase Light Up Board seemed like a big hit when I told my 8 year old son about it . As soon as the item came he was quick to open the package and was eager for me to help him set it up . Unfortunately that is when the excitement faded . As we put the board together it turned out to be very cheaply made with construction that does not look like it will hold up . Once assembled the final result is a flimsy looking product that was difficult to use . The pictures do look cool once lit up but honestly it was not enough to hold my son 's attention for more than 15 minutes . Add to this the difficult clean up and my my son did not want to play with the light up board again . This could have been a great product but its poor execution made this below average .	-1
I thought this would be a good replacement for the magnadoodle that my 7 year old has outgrown . He always loved that and I thought he would love to draw on this now , but it did n't really work as planned . The board comes out of the holder so you can draw on the white or black side , it does n't fit in the `` frame '' really well , it 's wobbly . We also tried drawing the the plexiglass that 's in the frame and that did n't work too good either . It was hard for my son to erase too , he asked if it was meant for older kids since he could n't get the crayon off . He has n't touched this since the first time he tried it , so I think it 's a dud .	-1
I like having a clean house . Cluttered house - that 's okay ... but having a toy in the house that would smear on skin , carpet , and is a pain to clean is really not for me - particularly if the toy does n't work all that great . Crayola Dry Erase Light Up Board is great in concept . Draw on board , light it up , everyone 's happy . Unfortunately , this is not like the picture depicts . The board light up feature is n't all that bright . In a darkened room , the lighting was dim ... only okay . The crayons themselves are a mess . They smudge on everything from skin , the carpet , to clothes ... this stuff is annoying as heck . To add insult to injury , this stuff is a pain to clean off - particularly from the board . While my kids had a good time using the board , I would rather give them a dry erase board and a bunch of markers - while that too would get on them a bit , at least it 's dusty and not waxy to get off and the board clean up would be much easier.This was a toy that was great in concept , but not quite in execution . I would pass . Not recommended .	-1
The concept is great , a dry erase surface to create art with crayons so it does n't make all the mess of a marker board . The board is white on one side and black on the other , the crayons write well on the board itself and cleans up easily with the erasing cloth.The board goes into a frame where you draw on a clear surface on top of the board and it lights up with color change effects and looks pretty cool . Light effects look much better in the dark . This fun stuff is not all fun though , the board does not go into the frame all that easily and it is not secured in any way once you do get it lined up properly . The instructions tell you to color directly on the clear surface to use the light effects , the problem is that it 's really tough to get the crayon off with the cloth when you 're done.You think of a dry erase surface as wiping easily , this one you have to scrub and do n't plan on young kids being able to wipe it off themselves . The idea I really liked but the end result was overall disappointing .	-1
First of all , the title of this product is misleading . It uses crayons . It 's not dry erase in the sense most people think of , with markers.Where should I start with things I disliked most about this product ? The plastic frame is so cheaply made ; it feels like it will break or fall apart if it 's dropped or the screen pressed on too hard . and that 's just with me using it , not a child who 's moderately hard on toys . Really , it feels like $ 0.10 worth of plastic is all Crayola used . Terrible construction . If it was n't a Vine product , I 'd send it back.The crayons are n't that easy to erase . After drawing on it a few times , my 7-year-old son gave up because erasing it took too much effort , and I have to agree . After using the screen heavily , the crayons leave a film behind , which makes it look cruddy -- especially in its glow-mode . Since I assume the crayons are specially designed for this product , should you lose them , the toy is useless.The backlit `` glow '' leaves something to be desired . It uses two small lights on the bottom left and right of the frame . The glow effect is decent , except for dark a triangular void between the lights at the bottom . It really needed a third light in the middle . The lights have three modes : normal , slow fade , and flashing . In my opinion , it 's too little to make up for its lack of quality.I can not recommend this toy . For a reusable drawing board , get your child a MagnaDoodle . A pad of paper and crayons/markers/colored pencils works too , and it 's far less expensive than this disaster .	-1
The crayons are the best part about this toy - they are durable , bright colors . The concept of the Dry Erase Light-Up board in an innovative one , but the execution is n't so great . The product is made from flimsy plastic . My boys enjoyed drawing on it a couple of times and then watching it glow in the dark , but the novelty quickly faded when it took quite a bit of work to get the crayon off of the plastic in order to draw something new - it takes some significant scrubbing to clean it and start fresh ( not something little kids can do by themselves , it requires an adult to do the cleaning and scrubbing ) . It 's substantially overpriced ! Overall , it still needs some work .	-1
We expected this to be a great way for our 6yo son to be creative , but instead , it 's gathering dust on the shelf . It 's messier than we expected and actually has a lot of `` parts '' between the various uses . Things get scattered easily when he takes it out to play , instead of just being a clear-cut , intuitive toy . As other reviewers have said , it 's also not very easy to erase what he 's already drawn , making it more trouble than it 's worth . Forget the light-up board feature of this - my son would rather ( a ) play with a plain dry-erase board , or ( b ) play with a good old fashioned Lite Brite more than he would like to play with this again .	-1
We never could get this to work like it was advertised . The crayons just smeared and did n't erase and the construction of it was horrible . My kids could n't move it around without it falling apart .	-1
My daughter loves her larger dry erase board , and I ended up getting her this for entertainment for when she 's in the car . Unfortunately , I missed the writing on the bottom that mentioned 'crayons ' ... this is not a true 'dry erase ' board which is used with markers ... this is simply crayons on plastic.First , out of the box , the size is very disappointing . The 'product dimensions ' listed above is for the entire box , not the toy . The board itself is is only 11 '' x 9 '' , with the actual drawing space measuring 9 '' x 7 '' ... smaller then a standard piece of paper . The drawing area is also recessed 3/4 '' , making it difficult to draw comfortably . The board includes a piece of clear plexiglass that serves as the main drawing surface , and a reversible board with a black side and a white side that can be drawn on as well . Both are removable , and even when inserted correctly , moves quite a bit , causing additional issues when drawing on.Drawing on the colored reversible board , then inserting it into the frame behind the plexiglass and drawing on the plexiglass is suppose to give a dimensional effect , but it really does n't ... even the lighting , with its three modes of full-on , blinking , and fading on/off does n't provide the lighted 'neon ' effect that the toy implies.The colors , when the light is on , look way too similar on the black background . The light tends to make everything look blueish and the drawings look no where near as vivid as shown on the box.Lastly , erasing the board takes some scrubbing ... my daughter ca n't do it very well herself , so my it must be done by me or my wife.Overall , this toy fails on just about every level ... nothing works as I expected it to . My daughter still enjoys using it from time to time , which is why I went with 2-stars rather then 1 , but it 's nothing like what I expected and is obscenely overpriced .	-1
What a disappointment for my child . She could't wait for this toy for x-mas , it was one of her top wanted items . In her own words she has said it does n't even work right . It does n't do any of the things they showed on TV . So after giving this product chance after chance now she does n't even use it . By the way , for this type of toy , it was n't cheep but Santa likes to please very good little girls . Crayola products usually are quality products . Not this time .	-1
I bought this for my children at the thought that it would be cool to have dry erase crayons . I thought wrong i like the board itself but the crayons are hard to simply wipe off the board my children became easily frustrated with this product .	-1
There is not a lot that is positive that I can say about this toy , from concept to execution . Granted kids will sometimes gleefully destroy their creations , or their sibling 's creations ; ) However other sets we have from Lego , Tinkertoys , Lincoln logs focus on building , creation and imagination , not destruction.This set offers a bit of that , as kids make buildings , cars . There is not as much imagination involved , as they are using molds which are complete buildings and cars.Included in the set are 2 colors of modeling compound ( red and blue ) , some plastic molds , a molded plastic dinosaur catapult and coated play surface . None of it is done well , starting with the box which is not recloseable and needs to be taken apart to open the set . There is no way to put it away again.The modeling compound is gritty , has an interesting texture . It has to be kneaded and then pressed into the molds . it is very difficult to get out again ( without ruining the model ) , and does not come with a tool , unlike the PlayDoh Fun Factory The clay has to dry for 24 hours to harden , at which point the little modeled rocks thrown weakly at it are supposed t destroy those buildings ? It does n't work , nor does the catapult . Since I am discussing the clay , nowhere did I see the word non-toxic . I would not buy this for young children . Additionally , the instructions caution that it may stain household surfaces . Really , this is about the worst modelling compound I have seen in a set for children ! The molds are hard , not flexible plastic , which is what makes removal of the clay ( either hard or soft ) so difficult.Probably the highlight of the set is the dinosaur , which is relatively sturdy . The catapult , however , is not much of anything.Finally , there is the play surface , laminated cardboard with a street and parking lot , boxes for where buildings go . It is nether sturdy , nor something which encourages imaginative play.The set may serve well to help parents vent holiday shopping stress , if you can find a way to actually destroy the buildings ( and not house-hold surfaces ) .	-1
Crayola 's Create 2 Destroy Dino Destruction Stomping Mall takes a great idea and fails to deliver on it . This arts and crafts project comes with two tubs ( red and blue ) of putty that feels like wet stand but sticks to itself and not to anything else . When I first opened the putty and we started playing with it , I was impressed . The idea is to take the putty and squish it into the provided molds to make small cars , buildings and other objects so that your included dinosaur ( looks like a Stegosaurus with a tail that can flick balls of putty that you can mold inside the dinosaur 's shell ) will be able to destroy them later . The problem is that the putty takes forever to dry . The larger molds will take a few days to dry through depending on humidity . If you take the putty out before it is completely dry , you 'll end up with garbage . Obviously , if you choose to then destroy your creations , you 'll run out of putty . The putty is not very easy to work with in general and it is fairly difficult to make anything out of it with or without the molds .	-1
So let 's see , what do we have here ? -Putty that scratches and stains any surface it touches.-A tiny mat so you can use the putty.-Molds for the putty.-A Happy Meal quality toy dinosaur , worth maybe $ 1.This product seems designed to annoy and disappoint parents and children equally . A disposable , destructive , annoying box full of soon-to-be-trash.Save your money .	-1
This set was not as much fun as anticipated . Getting the dough in the molds is easy , getting them out is another story . If you want them to dry , you have to wait days.. if you try to take them out before they are dry , they do not come out in the shapes.. they pull apart . There is no easy way to get them out . You 'd be better off to just make shapes and pieces with your hands and skip the molds all together.The playing surface is jut cardboard . The dino toy is rather small . The shapes that the molds make are very small , which lends to them being so difficult to remove.I think you could have just as much fun , if not more fun , with any other clay/dough and some action figures or toy dinosaurs etc . This set is too much of a hassle and just not worth it in my opinion.The dough itself is fairly unique though . It is very gritty and the texture is very appealing to kids to squish around in their hands . It is more fun just to & # 34 ; mess around with & # 34 ; and experience the feeling of it , than to play with it as intended with the whole set .	-1
Not worth the money . As soon as my 8 year old was done with this , it went in the trash . Poor quality , messy and regular markers work way better .	-1
My son likes this toy , but I HATE IT ! Its so hard to figure out how to use it , and when you do , it makes a huge mess . We set it up , used it for a day and then promptly hid it so that he would n't want to use it again .	-1
No doubt , this is all my kids want to do . They love it . But they only want to make them , not use them ... or worse , give them away ( they are too expensive to give away ! ) . Unless your kids are great at following the `` recipe cards '' and are able to exhibit self control , strict adult supervision is required . There is no way to limit the amount of juice they put into the measuring cups , they easily overflow or tip over because the base is so small . Sure , the stuff washes off with water ... unless it is on their hands . So we have like 30 brown markers because that is what you get when you mix every color together blindly . Oh well , they had fun .	-1
An all day science project according to my sister in law . She threatened not to talk to me after doing one marker . Said it 's a messy nightmare .	-1
I can not rate this item as it was not sent to me . Based on this and other reviews on this item as well as others , this seems to have happened a few times already.We recieved the Crayola Dino Destruction Metropolitan Mayhem instead , which we liked .	-1
If with dad 's help my 8 year old found this really time-consuming to build and then it was very difficult to use the catapults . I doubt it will ever get touched again .	-1
If I could have actually built this set , it might have been fun . Even then , though , I really question its concept . The problem is with the clay . It 's not simple play-doh , but rather it 's gritty like sand is mixed into it . It says not to get it on furniture and the like because it can scratch the finish.So the concept is that it provides molds to make two different fortresses , then battle it out using the catapults . You get three colors of clay , the molds , and the box doubles as a play mat . The clay is supposed to harden , but it never hardens fully . Add to that two additional problems : The molds stick to the clay and do n't release it . The molds are really durable and heavy duty , but this means you ca n't bend or twist them well to release the clay . Therefore , I could n't get the pieces out without destroying them.That was a real disappointment after waiting overnight and then some . This is where the overall concept is flawed . Most kids wo n't want to fill the molds , then wait multiple hours as it instructs . It says not to add water to try and re-hydrate the clay , so I 'm assuming that if pieces break , crumble or get lost , you 'll need to buy additional clay instead of adding some water and re-forming.Between the clay not coming out of the molds in one piece , not being able to try and reuse it , and the fact that your kids will be shocked to learn they are expected to put everything in the molds then wait a few hours before playing , I do n't recommend this product .	-1
Let me start with a positive . I like the feel of Morphix better than Play-Dough . It has this neat gritty texture . It feels like a foam more than a dough . It will be damaging to the surfaces of your tables . So , as a stand along toy , the Morphix is a lot of fun.I was a little confused about how to use this play set . When the compound was still wet , it was hard to get out of the molds . Impossible , really . So if you want to create the pieces , you have to let the Morphix completely dry in the molds . ( And even then , they are not so easy to remove . ) So now , you have dry Morphix that ca n't be remolded and is eternally stuck in these molded shapes . Hard dry blocks that are not nearly as good as Legos . That 's what you 've got .	-1
My grandson , approaching five years old , was the target for this toy . But when we opened the package we were quickly disappointed . The contents did n't look like the items in the front cover : Two boys catapulting items to each other behind a high wall . It 's better suited for small action figures and the children sit behind a low table with the blocks as a sort of fortress wall , albeit not very tall.The cardboard mat does n't sit securely on the table surface , yet because the clay material leaves residue on coffee tables ( a sticky , cloudy seal ) , this is not recommended for indoor play on or near nice furniture . The pieces are too small for outdoor use as well.My grandson tried this out for a few minutes and then lost interest , telling me `` It 's boring , Oma ! '' What a shame as he loves other Playdough products more suited for young boys .	-1
My oldest one said , `` this is no fun . '' That 's a first . Until now all toys were fun.The benefit of this toy is that it includes 3 medium size round containers of a fun-to-manipulate clay-like substance.The demerits of this toy include the fact that it 's not like the illustrations on the box . The board is really a relatively small section of cardboard . It looks and feels cheap . The castle ( s ) can not be built because the material to do so is the clay substance and there 's not nearly enough of it for that purpose.I felt that the molds were not that serviceable because it 's unlikely children like mine will use them more than once.Finally , the catapults shoot the clay all over and can not really be used to shoot at such close range . The balls of clay then can potentially become a mess . Mainly the gap between the box illustration and the contents was too large .	-1
Just like my review for the Dino Destruction Mayhem item ... . this item confuses me as well . The & # 34 ; clay & # 34 ; that you have to put into the molds is a strange mixture and it does n't come out of the molds , you have to twist the molds and squish them just to get the stuff out , so then it loses it shape of whatever it was supposed to be and some of it is still stuck inside the mold . The & # 34 ; launching & # 34 ; of the & # 34 ; boulders & # 34 ; does n't work because the clay stuff did n't really dry so it was just a lump of stuff . My son did n't like this one either .	-1
I like the overall concept of this toy which allows kids to endlessly create structures to destroy . However , everything about the toy just feels cheaply done.The toy does n't even come in a real box , but rather a taped cardboard sleeve . This means there is no place to store the toy when you are done playing with it . You will want to get your own storage container to keep the many components in one place.As soon as I pulled the toy out of the packaging sleeve , the thin , plastic , clay containers fell on the floor and broke.The playmat is made of thin cardboard which wo n't lay flat well which is sort of important if you are trying to balance a structure on it . You are better off just not using the playmat and building on a table surface.The catapults are made of decent quality plastic . However , the molds are made of thin , flimsy plastic that will get distorted easily.The manufacturer states the toy is appropriate for ages 4+ but I think that is too young for most kids . I think it is better suited for much older kids maybe around 8 years old and older . You need a more mature kid to have the patience to build the fortress , not mix up the different colored clay , be gentle enough not to break the molds , and clean enough to pick up all the clay and put the many components away.I really like the concept of this toy which allows kids to be creative and build disposable structures . If they came out with a premium version with quality components , it could be great .	-1
Crayola Create 2 Destroy Fortress looks really cool on the box ; unfortunately , reality does n't live up to the picture portrayed . The molds are extremely cheap and the `` dough '' is rough and scratches easily . It 's interesting that the box notes that it can mar counter tops , floors , etc . but no where in the description online do I read this warning . It is strictly for outdoor play . The mold to make the catapult bombs did n't work well and we had to pull the stuff out and mold the item by hand . The catapult did work but you had to use both hands unlike the one finger shown in the picture on the box sleeve . The `` play mat '' for this set is actually the cardboard sleeve unfolded - we thought we were missing the playmat until we realized just how cheap the company had constructed both the box and the play mat . For the price , I would have expected more of this set.In the end , I would not buy this or any other morphix product in the future .	-1
This is basically scratchy Play-Doh - 1 tub each of blue , gray , and red . There are also molds to make bricks for a fort , catapult balls , and soldiers , some plastic catapults to shoot the balls at the other side 's bricks and soldiers , and a battlefield mat.It 's a cool idea , but the execution is underwhelming . The box makes it look like you can build giant structures , but there 's only enough dough for several small bricks and a few accessories . After struggling to make the various pieces , then trying to get them out of the molds , you basically end up with the world 's tiniest , most tedious snowball fight . Not recommended .	-1
With a name like `` Create to destroy '' , I thought surely my grandsons would go nuts . However , as soon as I saw it was not furniture friendly , I decided this was a really nice OUTDOOR toy . So that solved that problem , but there were others . The blocks that were supposed to create the walls were tiny , and not fun to knock over , since they were basically only a few inches tall . The picture on the box was very deceptive there . You would need much more clay to make a `` fortress '' of any decent size . While the kids did get some play value out of this , they have not wanted to play with it again . This toy is inexpensive , but you dont get much for your money .	-1
I got ta be honest , here , I really hate this toy . I am a patient person , very patient . But this thing drove me bat-crazy by the time my 7-year-old and I were done with it.You 've seen the other reviews , and the product description . `` Morphix '' , a gritty playdo substance , is pressed into various molds to build castles , knights and other items . You use the provided playmat to stage your battle , and use this plastic catapult to lob morphix globs at your enemy 's fortress.For me , almost everything about this process was frustrating , until the apocalypse we unleashed at the end . You see , after a good hour of castle-building we could n't really succeed in knocking down each other 's castle , even with a number of direct hits . I asked my son what his favorite part of the toy was and he said `` throwing my castle at your castle to knock it apart . `` Here are a few Bullet Points of Frustration : -The instructions are minimal . We spent most of the first 15 minutes trying to figure out why the Morphix was stuck in the molds , we could n't get them out , despite vigorous banging on the play mat ( which put dozens of little dents in it ) . Could n't they give some tips on this and other related subjects ? -The morphix itself is weird , and even after extensive kneading , still shed some of its sand/grit , which ultimately required a vacuum at clean up.-Once you 've made your shape and gotten it out , there 's about an 85 % chance it 's going to get squished in some way within moments of getting it out of the mold.-the catapults will only toss something that 's within a mm or two of an exact size , so stock up on ammo , and re-shape it frequently-you ca n't use the catapult with 1 finger like in the picture on the instructions . you need both hands.-the morphix does n't hold together after an hour or two , with handling pieces start to flake off.-there 's no easy way to get the packaging back together after you 're done with it . It took both of us and a Houdini-like flourish to get it all in there ... . then a few minutes later when we found a Morphix catapult bomb a few feet away , we both decided just to throw it out rather than risk having to pick everything up again.There would be so many ways to improve this toy . I look forward to having my son play this w/ a friend of his and see how THAT goes . I set the `` educational value '' to 3 stars , 2.8 of which are the educational value of how to deal with frustration . Overall 2.5 stars , an average of 4 from him and 1 from me . Time will tell , though , how often he/we come back to this toy . Right now I 'm feeling like we keep the catapults and toss everything else.If I have anything to add upon future blissful playtimes with `` Create2Destroy '' I will.UPDATE 10/17 : It 's been over 2 months since we played with this toy , and although I 've left it prominently displayed several times , my child has n't ONCE asked to play with it again !	-1
I was pretty disappointed in this . A cardboard base , weird play dough stuff , and while I was hoping at least for a decent catapult , it was n't . A terrible waste of money . My son and I were interested in it for about 3 minutes before we both decided it was just a bunch of junk .	-1
This looks so cool . My kids could not wait to open this . After we finally read how to do it and put it together , it was not fun . I think that this would of worked better without using the clay and use Play-doh like we did . The play-doh was much easier to create the objects . The clay dried and crumbled . If you have Play-doh this now becomes a great set that why three stars .	-1
This set is a disappointment ! By the box , you would think it would be loads of fun . Catapults , `` destruction , '' forts and of course making the pieces with the clay and molds . What more could a boy want ? Turns out , it is more fun to look at the box and imagine what fun it could be than to actually play with it and use it.The molds make tiny pieces - like lego sized . Imagine how many legos you would need to build a decent sized fort or any other structure . You only get 3 tubs of the sandy , gritty , odd feeling clay , and there are not enough molds to make enough pieces at one time to be able to construct a fort or worthwhile structure . I mean , you can make the various pieces , but it does n't amount to much and it is hard to get the hardened clay out of the tiny mold formations . The mold strips are pretty rigid , so there is no twisting it to try and pop them out or release the sides.You are to let the clay in the molds overnight to harden . So , that makes this a long process of play.The play mat is just part of the cardboard box.When the catapult works , it overshoots the boulders because it is too strong/powerful for the little , lightweight boulders.There is a lot of anticipation that gets built up with this set and then is quickly destroyed . The kids had more fun just playing with the clay , squeezing it in their hands , marveling at the odd texture etc. , than they did playing with the whole set as intended.This set is a bummer . Sorry Crayola .	-1
My daughters are obsessed with art and love Crayola products . We had just visited the Crayola factory and they had so much fun with the model magic that I thought they would enjoy this . They were very excited to get it , until actual playtime . The clay is different from Model Magic and my youngest did n't even like touching it . My eldest was enjoying herself , until you had to remove the clay from the mold . We could n't get the clay out . I even made her let it dry overnight , but this did n't help either . She was n't very interested in it that next day very much , anyway . It really takes too long for the pieces to dry before you can destroy them . And I thought there would be more molds .	-1
I do n't recommend this toy . I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because at least it is a construction toy that has three little tubs of clay ( gritty clay ) and a set of molds . Other than that , the set is a bomb . The clay is called Morphix , and the directions warn you explicitly that Morphix is abrasive and may damage surfaces ( like tables , floors ) . For the intended age range , I 'd rather have a product that does not require clay police . The molds themselves are very small , and the finished product does not , in my view , measure up to what appears on the box cover . When using the molds , the directions suggest turning them over and tapping them to get the clay out , but sometimes the clay just gets stuck . I do n't mind that kids have to wait overnight for the clay to dry ; we have plenty of building sets that require days to complete . But the whole result is underwhelming . The catapults are cheap and do n't work terribly well . The play-mat is small and just part of the cardboard box . I think you 'll end up finding this set deeply discounted at an arts and craft store near you .	-1
My boy and his friend did not like this at all . I will review this based on what they told me . At first they were very excited about trying this one out . Once they got everything out and set it up they played with it for about an hour . They said the stuff was cheap and boring . The worst part of this product was this construction compound that did not stay hard and made a mess ( I had a feeling that was going to happen so I had them play one the hardwood floors for easy cleanup ) .Thumbs down ! Get something else for your kids !	-1
Tried via Vine.Fun : 2 : It took awhile for my girlfriend and I to mold out the bricks . The Crayola version of Play-Doh is pretty terrible in our opinion and several times you could n't just 'tap ' the Morphix from the mold , you 'd have to take a ball and try to pull it out , so it took awhile . We finally just rolled the gunk into vague structures . The catapults are kind of fun once you get aiming and the like figured out , but this set is definitely not much fun . I think most kids would like Play-Doh more.Education : 3 : I 'd say you could go either way for Morphix , but the catapult and all can be semi-educational . I 'd just put it in the middle of the ground.Durable : 2 : The molds are pretty hard except for two thinner , semi clear strips with trees and ladders , which was flimsier than I 'd like , but the pieces should last if you know how to take care of 'em . I could n't give more stars for the whole set because Morphix is basically Play-Doh filled with sand particles , and boy , can you tell it ! There were little sand grits all over our playing area when we were done , so you 'll continually have to 'sweep ' up the dirt using the Morphix . I guess this was done for legal reasons or something , but it definitely takes the fun out of it . The box doubles as the playmat , and I think it should have at least been vinyl because it 'll take lots of punishment if kids do play with it lots.Overall : 2 : I do not think this is worth 25 or so dollars by any stretch of the imagination , regardless of how much free sand you 'll get from it .	-1
This toy is useless . It is suppose to be able to launch play-dough at buildings that you build . The play-dough was to be inserted into a dinosaur mold but the play-dough gets stuck in the dinosaurs mouth and thus you ca n't get it out . This terrible toy has no education value other than creativity.The set comes with two launchers , four molds shaped like houses , trees , etc. , and play-dough that seemed like it was mixed with moon sand.Overall this toy was boring . The molds are not too hard to make if you use enough play-dough but the launcher is not very effective.I would not recommend this toy .	-1
I ca n't find anything about this toy that I like . The set includes 3 small tubs of a clay like substance called Morphix . Unlike clay or Play-Doh , Morphix is abrasive and can damage wood surfaces.My 7 year old nephew played with this set for about 20 minutes , after which time he declared it `` boring '' . That was also 20 minutes of my life that I spent hovering over him , making sure that he did n't accidentally get it on my wood table and damage the finish . This toy wo n't be making a reappearance in my house .	-1
To wit , hard to assemble and 3.5 year old lost the interest very fast . The end . Yes , I know it says the age is 4 to 15 but this one usually has no problems with the toys for 4 year olds .	-1
First of all , I signed up to receive THIS product - the Crayola Fortress Invasion - and was sent the Dino Destruction play set , which was NOT what I wanted . But I understand the confusion with product fulfillment , as the UPC code at the bottom of the Dino Destruction box does , in fact , read `` Fortress Invasion . '' Hey , Crayola , Amazon , or whomever is responsible - get your packages straight ! ! But the frustrations do n't end there . The molding compound and molds are likely the same in all play sets , so I 'm sure this will apply to whatever Create2Destroy set is ordered . The molds are mostly non-descript rectangles - I could hardly tell *what* each mold was supposed to `` be . '' And the compound does NOT come out with a `` simple tap '' from the mold - it totally sticks , and falls apart in the process of trying to get it out . The compound has an odd texture after a while , too . Once I did finally get a mold to come out and placed it on the play mat , the mold would stick - the texture of the compound touching the mat turned into something resembling chewed gum.I will say that my 5yo son had a great time shooting rolled-up balls of the compound from the catapults , but that 's the extent of the real fun here . You would be better served by just using your own building blocks and toy cars to create a city/fortress/whatever , and then rolling up the compound to make projectiles to shoot from the catapults . Or else ... you know ... just not buying this set in the first place .	-1
The recommended ages for this set are 4 to 15 . I 'm not too sure about the ability of most 4 year olds to make these forts without a lot of frustration . I would tend to have 5 or 6 year olds on up and then also have my doubts concerning anyone over 14 , but as usual children are different . My 10 year old grandson turned his nose up at these and left his 8 year old brother to have his fun with itAlso realize , these are not building blocks , it is a gritty play dough type material which , even with the included play mats can create more of a mess than a parent or grandparent might be happy with . I did not appreciate all the ` crumbles ` that were created during play and during the construction of the blocks.The art work on the box is misleading ; the blocks are not even an inch tall . The blocks did not knock over very easily with the ` boulders ' that were catapulted at them . The plastic molds that you put the substance in does not always want to release the blocks and I vetoed the idea of using spray cooking oil , which just would have added to the mess.Sad to say , between the mess and the small rubbery type blocks , which my grandsons agreed ... that this would have been more fun with heavier plastic blocks , this seems to be an almost one use toy .	-1
It probably makes great markers , but we never even got that far . Its so complicated to figure out how to use it that we never even made them . My year old was disappointed and I was just plain frustrated .	-1
I love most Crayola products but the Doodle Magic Lap Desk is a piece of @ ! # % * $ ! The 'markers ' smell horrific and you can barely see the marks that they make when used upon the lap desk . I can not even believe this inferior product was put on the market . Crayola - what were you thinking ? ? ? Returning first thing tomorrow .	-1
Crayola Doodle Magic Lap Desk is a grand idea but unfortunately , the markers are awful . I thought they were dried out but bought some more and they were the same on this set . My 3 year old grandson played with it and mostly enjoyed the way you had to prime the eraser to remove the color from the slate . It is a sturdy toy and fits nicely on his lap but is so disappointing not having markers that color brightly !	-1
This is one horrible product ! It 's rare that I 'm THIS disappointed in a toy for my children.These markers are so light when used that your child can barely see what they 've drawn ! It 's about as much fun as using a white crayon on a sheet of white paper , which is frustrating to a child ! After a few minutes , both of my oldest boys ( 2 and 4 ) ended up just playing with the markers and stacking them on top of each other or putting them in their `` holding '' spot on the desk . Drawing , which is the purpose of this desk , was n't the least bit of fun for them.Since this was such a disappointment , I decided to take a chance on dry erase markers . Dry Erase markers **DO NOT** work with this desk ! It does n't come off . I 'll keep trying to clean our board , and if I find something that works , I 'll come back and let you know . Truly , THAT will be this toy 's only saving grace . Otherwise , it 's a total waste of money ! About the only thing I do like is the storage areas included . On the back of the desk , there is a holding spot for everything , except the washcloth . While in use , there 's holding spots for the 4 markers that are included.Another huge disappointment is that magic eraser . The magic solution looks a great deal like a bit of dishwashing liquid and water . When it runs out , though , it 's gone . I twisted and turned and tried everything , short of breaking it , to get the magic eraser open for a refill . Apparently , it does n't come open ! I searched and could n't find replacements , either . Such a disappointment ! ! Overall , I ca n't recommend this product , unfortunately .	-1
