To say his style has changed says that YOU only listen to what has been played on the radio . Weezy has set sail on a new voyage to take over hip-hop . `` Best rapper alive '' sounds arrogant , but who is n't arrogant in the business ? Kanye thinks he 's the best thing to happen to hip-hop , T.I . is screaming King Of The South and Wayne now spits his yada-yada . Who cares , like it or not Carter II is about to take him to that next level . What I see here ( again , I received an advanced copy well over a month ago ) is the same MC spitting the same styles over different producers beats . It 's time for dude to move on.Im a older cat form the boom-bap era of hip-hop . My acceptance of this southern hip-hop has been gradual at best ( I live in the dirty ) . I 'm not the biggest fan of Weezy , largely due to the others in his crew I dont care to much for . I have all but 1 of his previous albums , but after the last 2 releases I 've grown to like dude alot.When you 're done reading this review , search `` Robin Thicke '' ( great CD by the way ) here on Amazon and listen to the track `` Oh Shooter '' . Now listen to Wayne 's version here on track 16 . He killed it ! Big up Thicke for letting him get that one.2006 should be a nice year for Weezy F	1
I 've read a lot of these reviews and a lot of them are saying that the beats on the cd are n't as good as Mannie 's . Thats a lie ! I would say they are just as good if not better . But its just different styles so we cant really compare too much . The bests beats on this cd are probably : 7 ) Best Rapper Alive , 9 ) Oh No , 14 ) Hustler Musik and 17 ) Weezy Baby .	1
Lil Wayne is hot but go get ... the real Lil Wayne screw the majors ... ... Dedication 1 and Dedication 2 is where youstart ... but if you want hot mixtape getSouthern Slang 9 ... . is the one to get if you are only going to buyone album thia year ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
Wayne might be the hottest lyricist in the game right now . Pick this CD up .	1
Great CDWorthy of tha star count5 stars to da boy mos deftlyCop this mayn	1
I aint goin say too much besides Lil Wayne got talent but I would take him more serious if he wasnt tryin so hard to be like an up north rapper . The beats , flow , wordplay , even the swagger is that of an up north rapper . I dont even like to say oh thats an up north style and thats a down south syle cuz music is music but DAMNIT..Weezy ... YOU TRYIN TO HARD ... LOL . Nice album tho	1

Lil ' Wayne 's no longer little with his fifth solo release , eighth total and the second volume , Tha Carter . This album is a continuation of Tha Carter , but lyrically potenant than the previous releases as his newfound freestyle flow over this 22 track release contains fewer hooks and or choruses . It was hard to conceive how this album would turnout with long time producer Mannie Fresh absence , but the tracks were carefully picked to emphasize the flow . `` Money On My Mind '' sounds like a Texas style track as he struts his confidence and his drive of getting money . The lead single `` Fireman '' shows exactly how he 's matured and gained a swagger that alerts other emcees / rappers how hot this ex-Hot Boy is . The reggae , Jamaican whine production by Yonny on `` Mo Fire '' is a different approach that is exactly what the title states . Another Yonny produced track with the help of Matlock , `` Oh No '' has Wayne free styling continuous over the entire track as one of the many highlights of this LP . Switching over to a mainstream feel , `` Grown Man '' featuring Currency is a mature approach to the women in more than one way . The multi-laced track produced by Robin Thicke whom also did the featured vocals on `` Shooter '' for an anti-Hip-hop / rap tune where Weezy 's verses takes aim at the media over his music based upon his demographics . `` Weezy Baby '' featuring Nikki quotes `` ... if you do n't call him Weezy , then you must say F. Baby , if you do n't say F. Baby then do n't say it at all ... '' He features Birdman over the `` Paid In Full '' sample on `` I 'm A DBoy '' . `` Get Over '' featuring Nikki is about getting over death and life 's obstacles for a reality aspect through his eyes . This album is nearly flawless , and Lil ' Wayne is holding it down for 17th Hollygrove New Orleans . Hip-hop / rap have a new face and a new name Weezy F. Baby .	1
I do n't listen to that much southern hip-hip . It 's not that I 'm hatin ' , it 's just a matter of preference . Hell , I 'm the first to admit that the South has the rap-game on undisputed lockdown . I copped this Lil ' Wayne album out of curiosity due to all of the high praises on this website . I must admit that I 'm shocked at how tight this platter is - not only from a lyrical perspective , but the conceptual totality of the package . Weezy may have to replace `` Lil '' with `` Big '' because he has pushed his game to top-tier status . This is the type of album that takes a rapper to the next level . This is a clout album , a statement album , a mess with me now album . With this disc I put Weezy in the top-five category of active MC ` s . There are numerous standout cuts on this disc , with a considerable amount of stylistic variance . Aside from a couple of skip-tracks , my only real beef is that there are a couple of cuts when Wayne sounds a bit like Jay-Z and Kanye , and style-biting is never-ever acceptable . In Wayne 's case it 's unneeded because his individual talent and style can stand alone . However , I offer him one bit of career advice - cut your hair , put on your shirt , and make real music money .	1
This is a nice album , which is much more lyrically indepth than any other Cash Money release . I became a fan of Wayne after hearing him last year on Tha Carter , and his interesting flow and nice punchlines become quite addicting . Is this better than Tha Carter ? Lyrically , yes . Production wise , it 's good , but I prefer Mannie Fresh 's beats . If Mannie could 've been on board for this album , instead of falling out with Cash Money , this may 've been a classic . As it stands , though , this is an above average release from Weezy . Best rapper in the game since the best rapper retired ? No , he 's not , and I hate to tell Wayne , but Jay-Z was definitely not the best in the game before hand . Is this a very good albums though , with little to no filler ? Yes , and for that , I commend Lil ' Wayne . I look forward to future releases from him , as he is still very young , and his growth as an artist can expand greatly .	1
While i found a couple songs on Tha Carter II not to be to my liking just about everything else here is on point and for the most part above a lot of the stuff that was out when released . Songs such as Shooter , Hustler 's Musik and Receipt help make this one a cd that isnt something to be ignored also very interesting the first track of the cd . It feels like a battle freestyle rap not a bad thing in the least . It goes well to setting up the rest of the Carter II that ends on the same high note that it starts . Lil Wayne is doing his thing and this one is hot minus `` More Fire '' i didnt care for to be honest but i was feeling `` Fireman '' not my favorite track . It is evident though that he continues to up his lyrical game with each album or song that he appears on . Recognize Weezy is here and will continue to rock the mic with the best of them .	1
I HONESTLY DIDNT LIKE LIL WAYNE BEFORE THIS ALBUM , BUT THIS ALBUM HE PROVES THAT HE CAN SPIT . HIS LYRICS HAVE DEFINITELY IMPROVED A WHOLE BUNCH SINCE HIS EARLIER YEARS WITH CA $ H MONEY . EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ALBUM MAKES IT A HOTT ALBUM . THE BEATS , FLOWS , CONCEPTS , AND LYRICS . NOW LIL WAYNE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MC 'S NOT JUST CUZ OF THIS ALBUM , BUT ALSO CUZ OF HIS LATEST MIXTAPES .	1
Taking a little bit from T.I . when he first came out with dat title right ? Lil Wayne is definitely one of the best rappers in the game after this album Tha Carter II . He can even make a case for that King Of The South title ! That should speak volumes for Lil Wayne since this is coming from a guy who thinks T.I . is the best rapper out right now and one of his favorites of all time . I always liked Lil Wayne all the back from his Block Is Hot days but I never thought him to be better than BG or Juvenile but Lil Wayne has progressed..significantly in flow and lyrics . Nowadays I ca n't get enough of Lil Wayne ( Rick Ross - Hustlin RMX , Chris Brown - Gim me That RMX , Lloyd - You RMX , etc . etc. ) . It 's a reason why he is one of the most sought after mc 's in the game today.Every song is tight to me , and lyrically Wayne rips the whole cd to shreds . The production is undoubtedly tight even without Mannie Fresh ( although the album would have been even better with Mannie ... just check T.I . - Top Back for proof ... that beat is FAR superior to any beat on this album ) . My favorite song ( since I 'm a laid back guy ) is Grown Man which is just hotness even though the remix with Bobby Valentino is even better . Do n't be surprised if that song is the 3rd single especially since it 's summer time . However the whole cd bumps and you should n't have to skip any tracks . A definite dirty south classic and one of the best albums in a while . 5 stars .	1
This Double CD proves once and for all that Lil Wayne is one of the best rappers around .	1
This is Wayne 's best album it is good from beginning to the end . There are so many good songs on the album its hard to choose a favorite track . Top 5 songs Money On My Mind , Mo Fire , Best Rapper Alive , Fireman , and Tha Mobb	1
I PERSONAL THOUGHT ALL HIS OTHER CDS WERE GARBAGE SO I DIDNT EVEN BOTHER LISTEN TO THE 1ST CARTER WHICH THAT WAS A MISTAKE CUZ ITS NICE BUT THIS CD IS GREAT . MUST HAVE !	1
Although he was only 23 when this was released , Lil wayne has been puttin out album for 8 or 9 years , so his is n't a rookie . I honestly can say I 've enver been impressed by what he has put out other than a song here and there , but after a bunch of good reviews and people tellin ' me I had to check this out , I finally gave in , and I am very surprised . Claimin to be the best rapper alive ( far from it but this album puts him heading in the right direction ) . I do n't have many Cash Money albums ( about 4 ) , but this is a very ice album . With 19 songs , more than half are definitely worth checking out ( # 's 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 , 9 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 19 , 20 , 22 ) . Guests are minimal on 3 or 4 songs , and the production is good ( that has been a constant with Cash Money releases thanx mostly to Manny Fresh ) . A must have album and one that should n't be slept on.DeWayne Carter -- b . 9/27/82 -- New Orleans , LAcheck all my reviews	1
I remember dude when he came out with the block is hot when cash money was a fad record lable surplanting no limit as the new king of the N.O.At the time he was ok he was a kid I did n't expect much . I figured he would ride the cash money fame , sell alot of records because of the labels popularity and disapear never to be heard from again thank you and good night . Well weezy hung around releasing albums even when the label was dead . He released the carter and the only thing I thought of it was nice title . I still thought he was just ok even though I had n't heard him rap in a while . He released the carted 2 and I was like did n't he just use that title . Well fast forward to when the shooter video was new I thoutht wayne sound alot better , a couple of weeks ago the leather so soft video hit for some reason I liked that song . I got the father like son cd . Weezy flow was straight heeeaaaat . I was like this ni @ @ a is alright . Because baby was on it , it detracted from wayne so I got this . This ni @ @ a is on of the best out right now forget about it . His flow is fresher than jays yeah I mean Jay Z . The beats are right the flow is right the swagger is right . It kills me this ni @ @ a just got good and is cocky as ever . But , he actually can rap so I 'll give him a pass . I do n't mind if you boast as long as you can back it up unlik cam ron but that another story . I like listening to him rap he has kind of a light raspy voice but it works . Bottom line by this you will not be diappointed 41/2 stars . Peace	1
Lil ' Wayne once again puts the rap industry on notice . Tha Carter 2 is one helluva album . Credit must be given to Lil ' Wayne and his team on surviving the untimely departure of the finest producer in the business , Mannie Fresh . I must admit , at first I was a little skeptical after learning this , but Lil ' Wayne shows astonishing growth without Mannie by laying down some of his hottest lyrics to date . Beats/Productions are solid , but not Mannie great , and the lyrics are second to none . Lyrically , this is by far Lil ' Wayne best work , and in my opinion the best is yet to come . **** 4 stars	1
This is not only my fav . lil wayne Cd it 's one of my fav . Cds of all time . I recomend this Lil Wayne is a rapping beast !	1
me being a indie artist and all in the south , its hard because folks want the flashy talk about money , cars , and crunkness . I lost hope on the south ever being a standout for lyrical showcases . Lil Wayne , the cash money boy that I thought was going to fade out , changed the game up . The cd is every bit as good as good as the carter 1 . His lyrics is up there with the NY rappers . But as with most of the southern pop . they like crunk music . U wo n't find too much crunk here , just straight lyric torching and ripping through it . For the folks to listen to real music , you got ta pick this up . 4 out of 5	1
I would 've never thought that Lil Wayne , when he was talkin about Drop It Like It 's Hot , would turn out to be one my favorite lyricist . This cd is extrememly HOOD . He does n't even need to feature a lot of people on his cd . I was still listening to the Carter , now all I listen to is the Carter 2. Who says sequels suck ? I love this cd , and I recommend it to everyone everywhere !	1
I can honestly say that I had no idea what Cash Money Records was or who were the artists on there until I saw Juvenile 's video for `` Ha ! '' . As far as Down South music was concerned I had just got into liking No Limit Records and I had awlays been fans of Down South artists like Outkast , Scarface & The Geto Boys , etc . Eventhough , I liked Ha ! , I did n't know what to expect from a Juvenile CD , so I did n't purchase any Cash Money CDs . When I saw B.G . 's video for `` Bling Bling '' that fetaured all of the Cash Money artists then I decided to purchase Juvenile 's `` 400 Degreez '' and B.G . 's `` Chopper City In The Ghetto '' . After listening to both CDs , Cash Money was addded to my favorite Down South list , especially once No Limit Records started getting weaker once they let their producers , Beats By The Pound , stop producing the majority of their tracks.One of the first tracks that I remember hearing Lil Wayne on was a track called `` Play'n It Raw '' that was on B.G . 's `` Chopper City In The Ghetto '' CD . The song featured B.G. , Juvenile , Lil Wayne & Turk , which I would later find out were The Hot Boys . Once I heard Lil Wayne on that track , I knew that once he made a solo CD that he would be a force to be reckoned with . Once The Hot Boys came out with `` Guerilla Warfare '' , which was a nice CD by the way , Lil Wayne was amped and ready to drop `` The Block Is Hot '' . Once I heard that CD I knew that Lil Wayne would be ready for big things . The CD would end up in heavy rotation and my favorite tracks ended up being the title track , `` Kisha '' w/The Hot Boys , `` High Beamin ' '' w/B.G . and my all time Lil Wayne favorite track `` Loud Pipes '' w/Juvenile , B.G . & The Big Tymers.Lil Wayne 's next CD was entitled `` Lights Out '' . He had nice tracks on there but `` Lights Out '' was n't as good as `` The Block Is Hot '' , in my opinion . My favorite tracks ended up being `` Hit U Up '' and `` Shine '' w/The Hot Boys , and `` Get Off The Corner '' . Once controversy started hitting Cash Money with Juvenile and B.G . leaving , Mack 10 getting overpaid and the breakup of The Hot Boys , I did n't like the direction Cash Money was going in so I did n't purchase `` 500 Degreez '' especially after hearing `` The Way Of Life '' with TQ of all people.However , Lil Wayne rebounded immensely with `` The Carter '' . Backed with Mannie Fresh beats , Lil Wayne even surprised me with his lyrical content and the overall flow of the CD . My favorite track was `` BM J.R. '' but I loved the singles `` Bring It Back '' & `` Go DJ '' and his tribute to the Hot Boys , `` I Miss My Dawgs '' .To be honest with you , after I heared that Mannie Fresh was leaving Cash Money , I was saying to myself even if Lil Wayne decides to come out with a `` Carter 2 '' that it would n't be tight without Mannie on the boards . I can admit , however , I was wrong . `` The Carter 2 '' starts off with a wicked 5 and a half minute , no chorus track entitled `` Tha Mobb '' where Lil Wayne sounds like he is freestyling over a Heatmakerz track . After listening to the track twice , I said to myself , I guess he does n't need Mannie Freah after all . Then the 3 part track which includes `` Fly In '' , Track 13 , `` Carter 2 '' and `` Fly Out '' , I was amazed by how Lil Wayne is basically rapping which appear to be freestyle rhymes . Tmix & Batman should be commended by the track , as well as , giving the production over these tracks that are fed by Lil Wayne 's lyrics . `` Money On My Mind '' features a tight sample and Lil Wayne is able to contibute 3 nice verses over the track . Now I know I may upset some people with this assessment but `` Fireman '' and `` Mo Fire '' are the two worse tracks on this CD . `` Fireman '' is clearly an example of when people say do n't judge the CD by the 1st single , because if you did you would think `` The Carter 2 '' was terrible . Lil Wayne could have easily released `` Shooter '' , `` The Best Rapper Alive '' , `` Receipt '' or even `` Grown Man '' before he released `` Fireman '' . `` Fireman '' will definitely have you missing Mannie Fresh providing Mannie Fresh . `` Mo Fire '' is not even worth discussing . However , Lil Wayne rebounds very quickly by the time you get to Track 7 . `` Best Rapper Alive '' is definitely in the running with `` Shooter '' with my favorite song on `` The Carter 2 '' . Big D should be commended with his production and the clever use of the sample on this track . Before Mannie Fresh 's production would win over Lil Wayne 's lyrics . Now with Mannie Fresh no longer producing him and with his lyrical wordplay stepping up , Lil Wayne 's lyrics overshine the production . At first listen , `` Grown Man '' wo n't be one of your favorite tracks but the more you listen to the song that features Currency the track will be atleast something that you do n't mind listening to every now and then . It 's a contradiction to what Lil Wayne would usually make because usually he would make a song degrading women instead of making a nice rap song for the grown and sexy . `` Receipt '' is another one of my favorite tracks as once again , the proudcers on the track , Heatmakerz , makes a clever use of an old school sample and Lil Wayne takes care of the rest . The more you listen to the track you will definitely think that this track is dedicated to his boo Trina . `` Shooter '' was taken from a track by Robin Thicke entitled `` Oh Shooter '' that was on his debut CD . Robin Thicke incorporates his use of the song and Lil Wayne is still able to drop 3 verses to this track . The reason why this track is one of my favorites is because this track is different from what Lil Wayne is accustomed to doing . This track should be the next single , but we 'll see . Robin Thicke has a nice track out with Pharrell entitled `` I Wan na Love You '' . `` Weezy Baby '' is a very catchy track as Nikki lays down some nice vocals to this midtempo track . `` Get Over '' is catchy as well as Nikki returns to lay down some more vocals and Lil Wayne is actually able to bring some substance to his tracks instead of trying to win with clever metaphors . The track sounds like a dedication to one of his homies . `` Get Over '' is a nice change of pace because most of the tracks on `` The Carter 2 '' end up sounding alike.Other than `` Fireman '' and `` Mo Fire '' there are n't too many things wrong with `` The Carter 2 '' . There are times where the metaphors that he uses are n't as strong as the others and there will be times when you hear a song with tight lyrics and wonder how the track would have sounded with a Mannie Fresh beat . Some of the tracks sound the same but you can pretty much listen to every track on this CD.Cash Money may be on life support as a whole but Lil Wayne is doing his best to keep the label on his shoulders . If you liked `` The Carter '' then you should like `` The Carter 2 '' , even without the production of Mannie Fresh . If you liked `` The Block Is Hot '' , `` Lights Out '' and `` The Carter '' , then you will like `` The Carter 2 '' James ' Top 51 ) Tie Best Rapper Alive1 ) Shooter w/Robin Thicke3 ) Money On My Mind4 ) Fly In , Carter 2 , Fly Out ( Same Beat ) 5 ) Tha Mobb	1
I was n't expecting the production on this album to be as good as usual ( without Mannie Fresh ) , but the production is suprisingly great . Lil ' Wayne 's lyrics are straight fire as always . Lil ' Wayne truly is a great rapper . If he makes another great album like this and `` tha carter '' then I 'd have to say he 'd be THE BEST rapper alive .	1
He talks too much about how great he is . He raps the same in everysong . Actually 3.5 .	1
Well first off , nothing gets 5 stars from me unless its is peferfect in every track.Lil Wayne messed it up again with wack skits ; as he has done throughout his career . They are shorter this time , thankfully , but they still exist . Also , some of the beats are harder to bounce to ... and fly in/outs ' beats are n't too good . They could have been more monumental . They should have been.I 'm gon na go on a limb and say Weezy is definately top five rappers in the game now.Def order this cd .	1
Michael Watts was the right man to call for the job . He put that extra stank on it making it able to be smelt right through the bag . Pick it Up . Peace	1

Lil ' Wayne 's 4th album , 'Tha Carter ' , marked a huge lyrical jump from his previous 3 albums , and his work with the Hot Boys . I 'm not sure what exactly sparked this improvement , probably some combination of maturing as a man and MC ( you have to remember Wayne was VERY young when he signed with cash money , he was 16 when the Hot Boys debuted ) and just working on his writing and flow.Lil ' Wayne is now back with his latest offering , 'Tha Carter II ' , with the absence of Mannie Fresh , one of the key players in making 'Tha Carter ' such a good album . I anticipated this would really effect this album negatively , considering Weezy has never worked without Mannie Fresh altogether , and because Mannie Fresh is just a great producer in his own right . As I expected , Weezy is on point the whole album , but the production here is much better than I would have thought it would be . The Heatmakerz ( 'Tha Mobb ' & 'Reciept ' ) , T. Mix & Batman ( 'Fly In ' , 'Lock & Load ' , 'Grown Man ' , 'Carter II ' , 'Hustler Musik ' , 'I 'm A DBoy ' & 'Fly Out ' ) , The Runners with DJ Nasty & LVM ( 'Money On My Mind ' ) , Doe Boys ( 'Fireman ' & 'Hit Em Up ' ) , Yonny ( 'Mo Fire ' & 'Oh No ' with Matlock ) , Big D ( 'Best Rapper Alive ' ) , Robin Thicke ( 'Shooter ' ) , Deezle ( 'Weezy Baby ' ) & Cool & Dre ( 'Get Over ' ) all contribute beats in place of Mannie Fresh , and do a great job for that matter . The 'Fly In ' and 'Fly Out ' songs are sort of a continuation of 'Tha Carter 's 'Walk In ' & 'Walk Out ' , with 'Carter II ' being the 'Inside ' of this album . All 3 tracks have the same beat ( as did the ones on 'Tha Carter ' ) which features a great piano loop , and an orchestral part that increases in intensity as the verses go on.Lyrically , you definately get more than you would expect from Lil ' Wayne , but he still has a ways to go to become an elite MC . He 's one of the best in the game when it comes to punch lines & metaphors , and he has proved that he can carry an album , but he still needs to work on his subject matter , which is largely uninteresting and pointless . Another thing Lil ' Wayne has greatly improved over the years is his flow . He has perfected his trademark sloppy southern drawl , into one of the most original and interesting flows in the game . 'Tha Carter II ' finds Wayne even more mature musically and lyrically than on 'Tha Carter ' , and I think this is why I would give the edge to the sequel over the original , which I loved also ( But , 'BM JR ' still might be better than every song on 'Tha Carter II ' ) . But still , I highly reccomend both.Top 5 Songs ( In Order ) :1 . Shooter - A remake of Robin Thicke 's 2000 song 'Oh Shooter ' , and it might be one of the dopest songs of 2005 . Very original production , stuff you would never expect to hear on a rap album , and this is just a song anyone with an open mind should love.2 . Fireman - It 's the popular lead single , which often comes off forced and cheesy nowadays , but the great production and some of the best and catchiest lines from Weezy make this a banger.3 . Feel Me - Probably the best song lyrically , and just overall one of the best songs on the album.4 . Best Rapper Alive - Love the production , and another overall dope song.5 . I 'm A DBoy ( Featuring Baby ) - Great hype song with the drums sampling Eric B & Rakim 's 'Paid In Full ' . I do n't like Baby as a rapper any more than the next guy , he has a decent flow and goes well with this track.Worst Track : Mo Fire - Mediocre beat , annoying hook , and just not a very good song.Lyrics/Substance/Subject Matter - 8.5/10Flow/Delivery - 9.5/10Production - 9.5/10Overall Feel - 8.5/10Guest Apperances - Kurupt , Currency , Nikki & Baby - 5/10 - All of the guests only do hooks besides Baby , and they dont really play much of a role here at all.Overall Rating - 9/10 - If you liked 'Tha Carter ' , you 'll love this . Actually , if you 're a fan of rap in general , you 'll love this . One of the best albums of 05 . Pick it up .	1
I think I 've probably listened this album over 50 times now ... Simply Incredible . I love practically every cut on this album , especially the 3 versions of Carter II ( particularly Fly In , omg dude is insane . ) I remember back in the day i did n't really like wayne too . I guess goin to art school improves your flow . I also like how a lot of tracks on this album are different from your everyday rap album . `` Mo Fire '' with the reggae feel , and `` shooter '' with ... i do n't even know how to describe it . Ironically my least favorite track is his first single `` fireman . '' Dude 's lyricaly ability definately improved tho , i mean , going from lyrics of `` bling bling '' to `` in the clouds where the thunder 's crying '' is a huge jump .	1
We all knew Lil ' Wayne would be a hip-hop great when we hear Tha Carter , but Tha Carter 2 solidifies his greatness . He will be placed among greats such as Tupac , Biggie , Nas , and Jay-Z . His lyrics are off the f*ckin ' chain , he has FLOW , I cant stress that enough . As for the beats , GOD , they fit the content well and are the best beats i 've heard in a while . In comparison to Tha Carter , he stepped it up a few notches in every category . This album excels in every single category an album can be rated on .	1
greatest rapper alive . i love how he didnt use any big producers and switched it up with some very different beats and the best part is ; im really feeling it . cop it . best of the year . hands down	1
People have been sleepin ' on Weezy for years ! If this album do n't wake 'em up , I do n't know what will . As usual , Weezy spits the illest rhymes the south has ever heard , and he may in fact be the best rapper alive , since I 've yet to see anyone challenge him in ANY sort of way . Only two other artists are on the album , and they 're doin ' hooks ! Nothin ' but Weezy flowin ' from 'Tha Mobb ' , until it 's time to 'Fly Out ' ! Be easy..- Mike	1
who is lil wayne and how did he get so good ? 14 year old rappers are supposed to get their 15 minutes of fame next to the great rappers whose songs that they are featured on ( juvenile in weezy 's case ) and then be forgotten . wayne 's third album , 500 degreez , was not very good at all . but something happened to him , and two years later he came out with `` the carter '' which was an absolute classic . a year and a half after that comes `` carter 2 '' which proves that the birdman jr is easily the best rapper the south has to offer.now , I love t.i . and lil ' flip ( though flip has n't put out much recently ) , but they just ca n't compare to wayne 's lyrics . weezy has a flow like jay-z but mixed with a southern accent and together those two features are amazing . the beats are stellar , ranging from soulful ( `` receipt '' , `` hustla musik '' , `` shooter '' ) to hardcore ( `` money on my mind '' , `` fireman '' ) or a mix of both ( `` tha mobb '' in particular ) . a lot of people thought cash money would fall without mannie fresh , but wayne does n't need him as long as he has his unique style . `` carter 2 '' is easily the second best album of 2005 , behind none other than common 's `` be '' and just ahead of the game 's `` documentary '' , kanye 's `` late registration '' and little brother 's `` menstral show '' . `` carter 2 '' will be remembered for years to come , do n't be left out and wondering what it is .	1
How can anyone say this is n't a good album ? To the people who think he needs Mannie to have a good album he just proves that he does n't with every track . He 's really starting to prove that he 's got some real flow and proving that the south does have real lyricists . There 's not one bad track on here in my opinion . I think it 's a definite candidate for album of the year , along with Sound of Revenge . Wayne is straight fire on this album and you ca n't deny it . The best rapper alive ? From what i 've been hearing from the rap industry recently , he may be right .	1
When this album came out , I did n't find it any better or worse than Wayne 's breakthrough album , Tha Carter ; Wayne stepped-up lyrically , but I severely missed Mannie 's beats . It was hard for me to adjust to a Cash Money release lacking Fresh 's infectious beats , but once I took this for what it is ( which is a Wayne release ; not Mannie ) , I actually began to appreciate it more than its predecessor.I wo n't lie , and say I followed Wayne before Tha Carter . The only time Cash Money ever appealed to me was through the Big Tymers ' I Got Work , as well as Juvenile 's 400 Degreez . I honestly did think Cash Money was a dead empire before 2003 , when Juvenile 's Juve The Great brought some mainstream spotlight back onto the label . Juvenile did n't have an extended stay on the label , but it did n't matter ; later that same year , Wayne picked up the ball , and ran with it , releasing Tha Carter . Tha Carter was built on Mannie 's beats and Wayne 's newfound flow ; Mannie laying the foundation to this complex , and Wayne building from there with his rhymes.I think all of us were worried when we found out Mannie severed ties with Cash Money , because Tha Carter 2 seemingly needed Mannie 's beats to once again cememt that foundation . However , Wayne did n't allow his house to crumble ; instead , he brought in a cast of underground , east coast producers , and created Tha Carter 2 ; arguably the greatest release to ever come out of Cash Money Records.The sound is nothing like previous Cash Money albums ; and that 's why it succeeds . With production handled by a handful of cats , they provide the perfect musical backdrop for Wayne 's unique flow . While Tha Carter was a great release , Wayne sounded a bit too comfortable flowing over the beats Mannie produced ; changing his enviorment like he did on this release brought out the best in Wayne . On The Carter , Mannie 's production sometimes overshadowed Wayne 's lyrics ; on Tha Carter 2 , they perfectly compliment them.This is a great album from beginning to end ; saying this will become a classic within the coming years would not be an overstatement at all . As it stands , it IS a Cash Money classic , and one of the best modern commercial hip-hop releases you 're going to find from any region . Wayne may not be the deepest of individuals , but he has a supreme way with wordplay , an infectious flow , and an ear for truly hot beats ; make sure to pick up this release if you 're a hip-hop head .	1
i first thought this cd was so overrated when everybody said this ( ... ) was the classic ... especially because of the fact that i did n't like fireman that much ... but i was wrong , this cd is the BEST cd of 2005 ! i do n't think he needs mannie fresh that badly , he got T-MIX and the DOE BOYS ( who produced the most of the songs ... ) the best songs are ... GROWN MANHIT EM UPHUSTLER MUSICRECIEPTI 'M A DBOYFEEL MEGET OVERanyways , THA CARTER 2 is less commercialized cd which is a classic ... .	1
Good album , its a album that got me in 2 his music . the mobb , best rapper alive , and Hustler Musik , its hard 2 give this album a five , cuz im very judge mental on album 's being a 5 , that means the whole album classic , this album 's not classic , everybody said this boy came out hard , Not really Bossman comes HeLLa Harder . these fools say `` HE SPITS FIRE '' , but IN MY MIND , WEEZY GOTS MAD SKILLS AND SEEMS 2 hold Them Back.thats why i gave it 4 , he lacks the ability 2 just be like F*ck it and go out and murder a track . it left me wanting more so i say carter 1 is alot better . after listening 2 both of them i think his fans made the carter 2 sound better then it was .	1
This album surpassed the expectations that I had of it . I hoped it would be good but I did n't get my hopes up too high because a lot of rappers could n't have pulled it off . LIL WAYNE IS THE HOTTEST RAPPER ALIVE.This is one album that you can bang in the hood , chill wit your girl ( cuz some of the music is so mellow ) , or just listen to and think about life in general . If you loved Jeezy and Bun B 's Trill , then cop this because it is one of the best albums of 2005 . Dirty South Baby ! !	1
This is Wayne at his best and I have been listening to Wayne since the Hot Boys and always thought his voice stood out and his lyrics got better and better through time ! ! When he wants to rap he is easily a top 3 MC right now peace	1
After the successful release of the almost platinum album , `` Tha Carter '' , Lil Wayne does n't take long to dish out another plate of his new style . On `` Tha Carter II '' , Wayne is out to prove just how dominent he is in the game . It was released in December 2005 and currently has sold over 1 million copies.1 . Tha Mobb - 4/52 .

Some of Lil Wayne 's hooks just do n't sound right . Production is on point for the most part but you can definitely tell the absence of Mannie Fresh . Cop this album and support a real southern artist .	1
This cd truthfully might go down as one of the best cds to ever come out . .as in classic material . Thats all I 'm gon na say . .YOUNG MONEY BIOTCH	1
Weezy is killing it . i was sold on the carter of how talented wayne has become . i think after he got out from under juvi and bgs spotlight ppl were able to start noticing him . he has also grown as an mc i think this is due to his age when he entered the game . bc now he is rapping woth more depth and substance then wen he was younger . i would have to put him within the top 10 in the game right now.Now speaking on the carter 2. this is a very intelagent creative album . there is very little guest apearances i think one from the birdman a song with kurupt and a few other minnor features . i was sad to c wen i first bought the cd that mannie didnt do any of the beats . then i listened to the cd . the production has no big names but doesnt need them it is a great produce cd even without mannie . there is realy only one club banger which is fireman , this is like the carter 2 's go dj . there is maybe 1 or 2 songs that i am not all the way feeling but they are still tight . also like the first cd carter 1 they have a few tracks like the walkin were the same beat is used one 3 dif songs , its like one track has been cut into 3 and spaced out through the cd . the best track by far on the cd is a song called shooters . this song is one of the most creative songs i have heard in a long time . the hook is hott and weezy spits with so much fire and emotion . im not sure but it kind of sounds like it samples a beatles song but i could be wrong.lil wayne definatly left everything he has on this cd and that is a whole lot . he has deffinatly earned his spot as one of the best in hip hp right now and i think is way beyond the money and ice rapper that he once was and is now one of the `` best rapperes alive ''	1
I 've been listening to Houston underground since 1996 , and SwishaHouse has always held it down since the late great Screw ! ! The best rapper alive ... .definetly ! And to make it even clearer , Watts slowed it down to make you hear and pay attention to his words . If you do n't know anything about the screwed and chopped movement ... .do n't buy the album !	1
This album has got to be Lil Wayne 's best album to date . It 's even better than last year 's spectacular Tha Carter . It 's even more amazing that he freestyled the whole album and did n't write anything . He 's developing into a true lyricist . Forget T.I , Lil Wayne is the true King of the South ! Wayne could become a legend if he keeps this up . In fact he could be the Dirty South 's Jay-Z . This is a real southern classic and one of the year 's best albums .	1
First off For all who do not own a copy of this album and bash it to convince people to listen to 'real hiphop ' are wasting time ... ..Stop telling people what to listen to , nor whine about an artist you do not like if because its NOT relevant to the album at all.Second off , Ive listened to this cd for a few days now , and the beats , more impressive than I thought . Theres a mix of southern and New York style-ish beats on here , so theres good variety on this disc right here . Lyrics ? More distinguishable than the previous Cash Money releases , but this time around it feels much more serious and actually like a complete record thats been taken time to fully create . One of my favorites on here , 'Reciept ' rocks a typical east coast sounding beat with a nice soul sample , on this one Wayne shows some more versitality on here , instead of throwing a bunch of words together to make a rap like it seemed like he used to . Theres More delivery , more punches , not bad for a southern artist like himself . THis is the direction he shouldve BEEN taking his skill of lyricism too , now all he needs to do is roll on with it . There are conceptual songs on here , such as 'Grown Man ' , 'Hustler Musik ' 'Reciept ' are fine examples of this . There are punches and metaphors he uses on the versus and they do stand out , most are basic , but nothing to played out nor wack . If you ever doubted the southern rap scene , give this one a try , I personally believe its one of the better southern hiphop cd 's to be released all yrGood production , good to exceptional/respectable lyrics , not quite there in 5 ' star range in my opinion , but its pretty damn good .	1
As one of the year 's last major rock releases , System Of A Down sure helped close 2005 with a bang by releasing `` Hypnotize , '' the second half to their two-part album . `` Mezmerize , '' the first half , was released this past Spring and was such a great album that it had me pumped to hear what else the guys had in store for us . `` Hypnotize '' does not disappoint and definitely helps take System Of A Down to the next level , musically and professionally . I remember when they first came out , nobody knew what to make of them and they hardly got any positive press . Today , the tables have turned , as System Of A Down have become one of the most respected rock bands of the new millennium . You ca n't open up any music/entertainment magazine without seeing something about them . As of 2005 , System Of A Down have successfully infected the mainstream . And what a way to do so.The first handful of songs , `` Attack , '' `` Dreaming '' and `` Kill Rock N ' Roll '' do well to get the blood pumping , while not straying too far from System 's signature sound . The title track and first single , `` Hypnotize '' is one of the most simple , yet beautiful songs System Of A Down have written to date , and from there it 's a bit more challenging . I got ta admit , the first few times I listened to this , I was a bit indifferent to what I had heard . A lot of songs on here , such as `` Lonely Day '' and `` She 's Like Heroine '' ( which are Daron-dominant tracks ) simply are n't instant hits , but glue themselves to your brain after a while . However , severe adsurdity prevails in `` Vicinity Of Obscenity '' which will defnitely make you feel at home . The closing track , `` Soldier Side '' is a continuation of the opening track on `` Mezmerize '' and serves as an epic closer to this piece , and the perfect way to connect both albums . Because afterall , they are one in the same.Of course , everyone has preferences as to which part they like better . Personally , I 'm still stuck on `` Mezmerize '' and probably will be for a long time . However , put 'em together , and you get one hell of an album . Surely , they could have cut out a few tracks here and there and released this all as one album , but who cares . It was worth the wait and worth the money . System Of A Down never disappoint , and if you were mezerized by `` Mezmerize , '' then `` Hypnotize '' is definitely a worthy trip .	1
Well , at first , and still even , i am not quite sure how to describe SOAD 's new record . It is actually a bit more unusual than Mezmerize , but unfortunately not better i do n't think . I think at times on this they tried too hard to be out of the normal sound . I love their past releases because it feels like the songs came natural but these seem forced and some are only decent . But after all that it is truly an enjoyable listen.1.Attack 9.5/10 ... One of my favorite soad songs . It starts off very heavy with the fast drums and the melodic chorus makes it a great song.2.Dreaming 9/10 ... Definitely a song that grew on me . At first i was n't a big fan of it , but it has certainly grown on me . My favorite part is the middle with the breakdown and Daron singing.3.Kill Rock N ' Roll 8/10 ... Eh . Another Cigaro type fun song . But , it 's really only decent . Too hard to understand the message if there is one ... except for the grass part.4.Hypnotize 9.5/10 ... A more serious side of SOAD that i love to see . Such a melodic song and i love the intro into it.5.Stealing Society 8/10 ... Another decent song . The beginning is a tad annoying but it ultimately turns into a good song.6.Tentative 10/10 ... Probably my favorite song on the cd . Great lyrics and you ca n't beat the chorus or the bridge where the heaviness kicks back in . Good stuff.7.U-Fig 9/10 ... The beginning guitar is so cool sounding and then the song explodes . Serj owns the vocals all the way so it 's great stuff.8.Holy Mountains 9/10 ... A five and a half minute epic . Softer more melodic verses with eratic outbreaks of the chorus which is extrememly heavy and pretty fast paced . New ground for SOAD and a great song.9.Vicinity Of Obscenity 7.5/10 ... One of , if not the weirdest song every by System . I loved it , but it gets annoying quick and it 's kind of pointless.10.She 's Like Heroin 6/10 ... My least favorite on the cd . Just not good , Daron on vocals , it 's almost nauseating , kind of like Old School Hollywood without the guitar breakouts and the techno voice.11.Lonely Day 7.5/10 ... Eh . Another not so great song by Daron . Just kind of boring , and i ca n't get past the line `` the most lonliest day of my life . '' It does n't make sense , anywho , just ok.12.Soldier Side 9/10 ... Thank goodness . A Great song to end a pretty good cd . Great lyrics , some of their best , and it 's very epic.Overall pretty decent , i recommend picking it up along with Mezmerize because they 're both good , but I highly recommend their first 3 albums , because that 's where the real System is .	1
`` Hypnotize , '' the second half of System of a Down 's 2005 opus , is clearly a continuation of their first album , `` Mezmerize '' ( which was released earlier in 2005 ) . In addition to not being very far removed musically from `` Mezmerize , '' this album also follows about the same blueprint . The songs on `` Hypnotize '' are very corky and energetic . It combines jokes with serious , bold political messages , and heavy songs ( `` Stealing Society '' ) with slower , ballad-esque numbers ( `` Lonely Day '' ) . Plus , many of the songs have several tempo changes . ( `` Dreaming '' combines `` Chop Suey '' -esque singing with tempo changes that bring `` B.Y.O.B . '' to mind , and `` U-Fig '' and `` Holy Mountains '' are chaotic , off-the-wall tunes with whiplash speed changes and even acoustic guitar breakdowns . ) And , finally , guitarist/songwriter Daron Malankian gets more time at the mic than he did on the band 's first two albums . But most of his singing , here , is actually pretty good . ( Track one , `` Attack '' begins with fast , ultra-crunchy riffs , before Daron begins to croon nasally , and he actually sounds as good as Serj . ) There are a few throw away tracks on here . `` She 's Like Heroin '' goes absolutely no where , and `` Vicinity of Obscenity '' is so silly , it could be a `` Steal This Album '' b-side . But there are several more good songs than so-so 's , and there are a few mature moments ( i.e . `` Kill Rock ` N Roll '' and the title track ) , which sound more along the lines of a traditional System of a Down song.Upon my first listening to this album , I was not at all impressed . I thought System were trying to hard to be funny , but usually ended up coming across as goofy . Fortunately , however , I gave this disc repeated spins and it grew on me quite a lot . So I recommend you do the same ; buy it , and give it time to sink under your skin ( something it will most definitely do ) . It is n't a great C.D. , but it 's still quite good , and worth buying if you 're a fairly big SOAD fan ; if you 're a casual fan , however , you could probably just be satisfied with any one of System 's five records .	1
system of a down has not recorded one song that i get tired of , i can play them over and over , it 's rock opara and it 's flipping awesome , this is their best so far , each new album surpasses the one beforehand . hynotize is great it 's all the previous for chalked up into one , plus a ejaculation a new stuff , this stuff is great to do anything to , just get system of a down blast it and do something , try blindside and embodiment and flyleaf to , and kittie , i am telling you you can not go wrong . Jared what a guy .	1
I 'll be the first to admit that Mezmerize was a mild letdown . Needless to say I did n't rush out to buy Hypnotize . It kills me that they would put Daron Malakian in charge of a majority of the vocals when you have a truly incredible vocalist like Serj in your band . Serj made this band for me all those years ago and continues to be my favorite part of System Of A Down . However , after countless listens to not only Mezmerize , but also Hypnotize , I can honestly say that I 'm thoroughly impressed.System Of A Down have always been ahead of their time . Serj 's insane vocal-stylings boggle your mind at times , the lyrics are always strangely intricate , and the music never fails to get your blood rushing . Those things have n't changed a bit.Attack is the most reminescent of the older System stuff thanks to the excellent sing-along quality of the chorus . Dreaming shows Daron 's vocal ability off quite well , particularly towards the end of the track . Hypnotize has great dual-vocals with great lyrics and music . Tentative is one of the few tracks where Serj conquers the running time and , as expected , he commands your attention . Holy Mountains serves as the best song , along with Attack . The beginning is quite haunting until you get to the intense chorus . Vicinity Of Obscenity is your typical strange SOAD track , much like This Cocaine ... was on Mezmerize.My favorite songs are Attack , Hypnotize , Tentative , Holy Mountians , and Vicinity Of Obscenity . Hypnotize was far from an instant hit with me so if you 're anything like me and dismissed this after the first couple listens I definitely recommend going back and giving it a few more detailed listens . This is still SOAD and all the elements that made them so amazing are still prominent . So yeah , if you 've yet to hear this check it out .	1
I just bought this album today , with Mezmerize . I do n't want to make a huge review , cause it 's 1:07 am . It 's a great cd , unique and different .	1
Mezmerize and Hypnotize are brutal slabs of truth served up by SOAD . This stuff never stops abrading , pushing , screeching , pounding . Wonderful .	1
Sound : The short story , System Of A Down have written one of the best of records of their career , of the year , and of the decade . Hypnotize is the perfect blend of blazing screaming crazyness that was very present in their self-titled effort and Toxicity , and the more safisticated blazing screaming crazyness that was Mezmerize . Anyone who had doubts of a band selling out when Daron Malakian started singing will have their doubts thrown right back at them . System Of A Down managed to blend both Daron and Serj voices perfectly into these group of songs , while perfectly mishmashing guitar crunching with well organized riffs . There 's not much more to it . This is the perfect combination of what System Of A Down does best . // 10Lyrics : Lyrically Hypnotize shines . Perfectly blended with very heavy symbolic messages and flat out screaming and noises , and no matter which on of the two it is , or somewhere in between , it will get your attention , and bury somewhere deep in your head . The riffs and lyrics will stick to you , a gift System of a Down has mastered , undoubtly a huge part of their massive success over the last couple of years . Hypnotize also sees the horizon broaden lyrically for System Of A Down . They tackle issues such as War , of course , with songs like Soldier Side , the continuation of the intro from Mezmerize , which sees the songs taken to epic proportions , one of the biggest sounding songs System has ever done . Not to mention the songs that are just down right crazy , like Kill Rock n ' Roll or Vicinity Of Obcenity , but System of a Down would n't be System Of A Down if they did n't load it full of symbolism . The one big surprise comes in Lonely Day , the only really personal song System Of A Down has really done , with lyrics like `` If you go , I wan na go with you , and if you die , I wan na die with you '' really touch a nerve that System has n't explored before , and they do it amazingly well . // 10Impression : It is no doubt that Hypnotize will outsell anything System of A Down has ever done , and it should . Mezmerize blazed the trail for this albums much anticipated release , and System deserve any praise that this album gets . They perfectly tweeked a sound that has driven them to the top , mixing what their self titled album and Toxicity did for them to be the one of the most respected bands in metal , and what Mezmerize has done for them to be one of the most respected band in music today . // 10	1
This release is definitely better than the first half of System of a Down 's double-album project this year , the horrifically misguided Mezmerize . Hypnotize partially redeems the project with a generally stronger set of songs , but releasing the new material on two albums has had middling results at best . Like all double albums , this material could be boiled down to an incredible single album , but as a double it 's just bloated and unfocused . Eliminating stone-cold garbage like `` Cigaro '' and `` Old School Hollywood '' from Mezmerize , and `` Kill Rock n ' Roll '' and `` She 's Like Heroin '' from Hypnotize , would have made SOAD 's recent product look much more focused and hard-hitting.As for Hypnotize itself , SOAD 's strengths are exercised a little better this time , especially in a commanding trio of tracks in the center of the album & # 8211 ; `` Tentative , '' `` U-Fig , '' and the band 's most haunting look yet at the Armenian genocide of the early 20th century , `` Holy Mountains . '' Unfortunately , the momentum is then broken by the stupid `` Vicinity of Obscenity . '' Of course , the band uses such nonsense as an artistic statement , and they 've even done it successfully in the past , but here the point just does n't come across . Meanwhile , the useless `` Lonely Day '' proves why SOAD should not be doing ballads , though the full version of `` Soldier Side '' can nearly match `` Aerials '' as the greatest of SOAD 's powerful slow-burners . But the overall lesson of this double-album project is that the efforts of SOAD ( and particularly Daron Malakian ) to expand their sound are not leading to true advancements , with a real shortage of their former triumphs in breakneck songwriting and fearsome chops.Malakian has earned respect as an outstanding songwriter , but in his baffling drive to advance his own less-than-stellar skills on vocals and guitar , he is egotistically wasting the incredible talents of his bandmates . The relentless rhythm section of Shavo Odadjian and John Dolmayan has been pushed to the background , while Serj Tankian is now crushingly underutilized . Metal singers who can truly sing are terribly rare these days , and Tankian 's incredibly inventive phrasing and terrifying delivery make him one of the best ever at forcing the listener to really think about what he 's doing . It is downright insulting to watch Tankian be reduced to a fraction of lead vocals , and to have to listen to him singing backup to the far weaker vocals of Malakian , whose whiny and reedy voice is seriously damaging the power of SOAD 's material . In the future , Malakian must retreat back to his core strengths as a songwriter , so the band as a whole can exercise its incredible power once again . [ ~doomsdayer520~ ]	1
to give system credit theyve played it quite rightly here they put all the radio frendly hits on mesmerize and then release this much closer to the old system than mesmerize was in my opinion much better as good as mesmerize was it seemed empty and seemed to end to soon the two albums are best together in my opinion so buy both if your intrested here is a low down of the tracksattack 9/10 nice opener to the album sounds like its going to be another song in the same vien as prison song until it switchs to a softer verse and then the chorus hits you like a sldge hammer definatly leaves an impressiondreaming 10/10 this song is very strange the verse is over dubbed sounds like something out of a horror film there is a nice middle 8 at the end witch is surprisinly poppy it dosnt end how youd expect it to has some amazingly melodic moments this song craft was slightly lacking from mesmerize its good to see system trying it againkill rock n roll 9/10 this is a good song it sounds great the verse would of been better had serj sung the lead but the chorus is memorable and catchyhypnotise 8/10 weve all heard this one by now definatly has more of a single tructure a nice song slowely builds up the chorus at the end is louder than the verse witch is relitivly quietstealing society 10/10 this is a strange song has a nice feel to it repeats the same phrase of notes but in different pitches hard to explain and the point when it changes moods and daron comes in is brilliant its the one song in witch i would say darons voice is truely stunning it sounds a bit like the sex pistols at the end it kind of shifts from that melodic strangness into raw punk agressiontentative 10/10 this is one of my faverotes on this album the verse is brual and harsh the lead up to the chorus sounds like a desperate cry for escape `` can you hear us we are rotting '' towards the end the song shifts again and ends quietly this song is where art and music meetU-fig 9.5/10 first time i heard this song i realli didnt like it unlike the rest of the album but after listening to it more than once it has grown on me sounds alot like the toxicity period ( toxicity in my opinion is there best album ) this song needs listening right through and i always enjoyed the chilli esque guitar in the bridge section a good songholy mountains 11/10 now this is a realli good song has so much too it its emotional and haunting and rivals mettalica ( when they where good ) for epic song writing you can hear the emotion in serjs voice as he sing and the crys of LIAR KILLER DEMON have some kinda of demonic voice in the background one of the best on the albumvicinity of obsenity 8/10 this is where the album changes the mood of holy mountains instantly changes ( only complaint i have about the album ) the other songs have been relitivly serious and thought provoking this one just made me lauf i still love them for there wacky moments this is quite an enjoyable oneshes like heroin 7.5/10 this song is probably the 2nd ( other than lonely day ) weakest on the album although its good theres something i dont like about the first chorus when they shout the word arse otherwise would of been a good songlonely day 7/10 i always judge music above lyrics but the lyrics here are awful they dont realli seem to fit the tune is it gets goot after the first chorus not there best by a milesoldier side 11/10 after two relitivly weak tracks this one comes up this is a beautiful song sounds like armageddon feels like it two as always the melodys here are wistful and moving the lyrics poetic and daron and serj harmonising on the song is phenominal this song sounds like a desperate plea for help `` god is wearing black and hes never coming bak '' possibly a song about the funeral of the world its like a sad march of a deafeted and distraught army beautiful haunting excellent ending to an excellent albumso this is a worht a buy its a very good purchase worth your cash but buy both your opinon may differ from mine there are good songs on both albums	1
This is right their with their first Album . It is a very good Album .	1
SYSTEM OF A DOWN is such a great unique HEAVY METAL band ... .SERJ TANKIAN is a great lyricist and singer and the band is BRUTAL with strange nuances on the sound and a UNBELIEVABLE drummer ( one of the best ! ) ... .HYPNOTIZE comes nearly after the HUGE BOOM of MESMERIZE , and got many great tunes too ! ! ! ! If you like the SYSTEM METAL style you will like HYPNOTIZE too ... GREAT BAND ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
Now that we 've heard it all you got ta wonder precisely what the whole point of the whole 'Mezmerize/Hypnotize ' scheme . It seems obvious , paying twice for a double album that actually coulda fit on a single cd anyway . But if you got them right when they came out you probably only paid like 9 bucks for each of 'em , so the monetary difference ai n't much of a concern . Still I think the consumer came out a little behind , not because we paid too much but because we got more than we needed . Simply put , when SOAD needed to come up with 20+ songs in a single session they came up with a few more clunkers than usual . ( A problem typical of most double albums and pseudo double albums ) So , finally meandering to my point , 'Hypnotize ' has 3 lousy tracks . 'U-Fig ' is mostly just bland and uninspired , other than the chorus which is truly grating . ( Though it 's worth noting that I 'm in the minority on this issue , as most people seem to enjoy that piece of crap . In fact I seem to have received psychic comeuppance for my denouncing of the track as I just poured soda all over myself . Back in a sec ) Sadly , 'U-Fig ' is quickly overthrown as the most irritating SOAD song as we arrive at 'Vicinity of Obscenity ' and 'She 's Like Heroin ' . Here SOAD 's goofiness gets the best of them and they churn out to hideous novelty songs for those who ca n't distinguish between what 's catchy and quirky and what 's simply annoying and ridiculous.Still , the other 9 tracks are good , often great . They retain the greater sense of melody they found with 'Mezmerize ' and incorporate plenty of harmonies , which I feel really augment their sound . Many hate Daron 's singing and while he is annoying at times I think he 's mostly acceptable and , again , works very well while harmonizing . The instrumentation is strong and energetic and though they are n't really a Nu-metal band the instruments still largely just provide a base for the vocals . There are a few neat riffs , but this ai n't a thrash album or anything like that . 'Attack ' is what you need from an opener , very energetic and driving though it still has SOAD 's trademark sudden starts and stops . 'Dreaming ' is perhaps the strongest track , with a great epic , harmonious chorus and strong dynamics . 'Tentative ' is the next best thing , huge and emotional and apocalyptic . 'Holy Mountains ' is the most ambitious , multi-faceted thing here . Not every instance of it works , but it 's very good overall . They get a bit more emotional at the end , with the simple power-ballad 'Lonely Day ' and the closer 'Soldier Side ' . This last one is perhaps a bit melodramatic at times , but they pull it off anyway and it 's a fine capper to the whole project.Still , it shoulda been only 1 album . Lop off those 3 track I mentioned here and combine it with 'Mezmerize ' minus 'Old School Hollywood ' , 'This Cocaine ... . ' and maybe one more relatively mediocre track of your choice and you 've got the best SOAD album of their career . But 't was not to be , and it 's not like anyone is making me listen to those tracks , so I suppose it 's no huge loss.Lastly , the way the packaging of these albums is supposed to combine is lame , but whaddya expect .	1
Mesmerize seemed to be the transistion alblum this amazing alblum . It 's a throwback to the older CD 's and the songs are so dynamic . Definately not Underworld dynamic but extremly dynamic for a rock band . This isnt nu-metal at all . And my favorite songs off of Mesmerize sound more like ones on Hypnotize . A huge change now is Daron 's and Serj 's voices are working together instead of separately this along with way more changes within in the song make this one of thier best . It does have a more cohesive sound to it whereas mesmerize had experimental stuff going on all over . As with Mesmerize they have gone more political , focusing on the war and war in general . With this alblum they proved they could better themselves and i cant wait for the next alblum now .	1
5 stars should be given . SOAD is going on break and I think they have a right to after this album . Like Mezmerize , it has its fun , slow , and hard rocking moments . Vicnity of Obscenity is a fun and odd song , Lonely Day and Soldier Side are perfect examples of slow emotional songs , and hard rocking moments like Attack , and Kill Rock N Roll are perfect examples of the diverse act that is , System Of A Down . Like I said in my Mezmerize review , they threw Daron 's voice in to mix it up , I mean we are talking about SOAD here . Already a wacky music group , and Daron 's voice adds flavor . System of a Down finishes the year off with a bang just how they entered it ...	1
Despite the fact that I love Aerials , Toxicity , Chop suey , I never bought a SOAD album before this one . They were screaming too much for me . Now they have found the right balance between the two vocalists ( the beauty being Serj and the beast Daron ) .My favorite song on this one is `` Soldier side '' . I 'll buy myself an electric mandolin just to do that song . In second comes `` Holy mountains '' , to be listen very loud just to hear that scary `` can you hear feel their haunting presence '' . `` Hypnotize '' is third , but was the reason why I have asked for this album . The beggining of `` Kill rock'n roll '' make me think of `` Joy division '' ? ? ? I love all songs except maybe `` Stealing society '' wich I find very average.What I like the most about them , is their shifting beauty and beast mood . They go from absolutely georgous to angry metal .	1
System of a Down has finally released part 2 of the 2 album set , so how does it stack up against their previous work ? In short it was much more than I expected . After listening to the entire album , I believe Hypnotize retains the heaviness from SOAD 's earlier albums but goes to places they have never been before . Mezmerize , I thought , was an excellent album that was unique because the band was expanding its musical boundaries . Hypnotize continues this expansion but in my opinion it is a lot better than Mezmerize . I believe this album will be the favorite of the 2 sets among the true System fans , but that is my opinion . So what is so awesome about this album ? 1.Attack- starts the album off with a bang , thanks to frantic vocals from Serj and alternating vocals from Daron.2.Dreaming- a bit less frantic than Attack , but it sounds like something from Steal This Album . very nice.3.Kill Rock n Roll- this song amazed me when I heard it at the concert in Atlanta . The studio version is even better . One of my favorite tracks right now.4.Hypnotize- we all have heard this by now . It is definitely a surprise because it is a different direction for SOAD . I love it though because it has a punk feel to it towards the end.5.Stealing Society- Daron and Serj alternate vocals on this one and it is crazy ! Might be my favorite overall at the moment.6.Tentative- slower than the previous tracks , but still a powerful song.7.U-Fig- excellent guitar work on this track.8.Holy Mountains- this track was floating around the net and sounded awesome . the studio version does it justice as it sounds excellent . slower type of song but very strong , I am impressed.9.Vicinity of Obsenity- this is the craziest song on the album . chorus repeats `` banana banana banana , terra cotta pie '' . It is hard to find the meaning of this track but Serj is all over the place in this one ripping it to shreds.10.She 's Like Heroin- Daron stars in this track . this is a terrific song , one of their best I think.11.Lonely Day- my least favorite of the 12 tracks . Dont get me wrong , it is a good song but it is so plain that a lot of people may not like it . Probably the slowest song from any System album.12.Soldier Side- WOW ! this track is unbelievable . It picks up where Soldier Side Intro left off on Mezmerize , and I think these are the most personal and emotionally strong lyrics System has written . It ends the album on a very high note , leaving you Mezmerized and Hypnotized over what you just heard.I hope this persuades some new listeners to check this band out . The true fans do n't need any persuasion . I have been a huge fan since the self-titled album and I am completely amazed by Hypnotize . If you thought Mezmerize brought them to new heights , you have n't heard anything yet .	1
First off , 95 % of nu-metal sucks , other than maybe soad , slipknot and flaw still hold my attention . This is an album worthy of 4 stars . Serj is a great vocalist . However , Daron YOU SUCK as a singer . I 've been a fan since the `` System of a Down '' album . Which is classic , along with Toxicity . The lyrics have also lost alot of serious value . It is alot of goofy and corny type stuff now . Which is alright but can get obnoxious at times . Also , I am not one to act holier than thou if I have been listening to a band longer than a few others . However , it is REALLY annoying to hear people who have only heard this album talk like they know everything about SOAD . So , please stop it . Song 's like Kill Rock N ' Roll , Hypnotize , Tentative , U-Fig , and Soldier Side make this album really good in fact . However song 's like Lonely day ( What is worse , Daron 's vocals or his sappy cheese filled lyrics ? ) just bring the album down . If you are new to soad and are impressed with this album , check out `` System of a Down '' and `` Toxicity '' to really be blown away . Also , look at the song `` She 's like Heroin '' Serj 's parts are great and make the song listenable , , then Daron 's singing is just God awful . Seriously , who gave this guy a mic ? I would have given this album 5 stars if Serj had done all the vocal 's . I do recommend this album though , as long as you can deal with Daron 's vocals . Enjoy .	1
The follow up to the # 1 Billboard album 'Mezmerize ' that was released earlier this year , 'Hypnotize ' completes the double album release.If you love the band 's approach to politics , war , society and love , you 'll love this album . Do n't expect a mezmerize part 2 . This album is more serious , yet has those frantic and crazy moments in U-Fig , vicinity of Obcenity , etc.The only thing wrong with it is that daron sings . to be honest , daron cant sing.. hes the worst singer ive ever heard . why did you give up your spot as lead singer , serj ? daron should realize that he has an atrocious voice and stick to hes day job as the guitarist . so ... heres the song breakdown1 . Attack 4/10 worst song on the album2 . Dreaming 10/10 way more SOAD than the first one . i love the chorus3 . Kill Rock 'N Roll 5/10 darons singing ruins this song . he should stick with the guitar.4 . Hypnotize 6/10 overplayed5 . Stealing Society 8/10 this is when the album takes a u-turn for the best and turns into a good record . this song is pretty good until darons voice comes in . after that , the song is corrupt.6 . Tentative 10/10 this is a good one . not much daron.7 . U-Fig 10/10 excellent song . the second the song started i knew it was going to be great.one of the best songs on the album . more of the system of a down humor in this.8 . Holy Mountains 10/10 good song also . no daron in this also . just back up . very angry yet soothing.9 . Vicinity Of Obscenity 20/10 this in the only song that competes with the new version of soldier side . great song hands down . very fast singing reminds me of revenga alot.10 . She 's Like Heroin 9/10 this song is kind of bazzar but good . lyrics about men whereing dresses snd selling yourself for heroin remind me of the old days.11 . Lonely Day 10/10 darons peak of the album . this is the only song that darons voice sounds good . excellent ballad.12 . Soldier Side 20/10 absolue best song on the album . this is a greatending to the first soldier side and the album . alot of irony is used in this song ie . `` they were crying when their sons left ; god is whereing black '' overall , if your a true fan you should purchase this . if your new to SOAD and like this album , you should check out their self-titled cd , Tocicity and Steal This Album .	1
I 'm going to focus my brief review on System of Down 's Hypnotize more on their questionable decision to split the album 's up and release them 6 or so months apart.Now , if each CD had been over 40 minutes then that would 've been justified since a CD can only hold 80 minutes worth of music.But the previous album half called Mezmerize was only 36 minutes long and this newer half is only a little shy of 40 minutes long . That 's only close to 76 minutes worth of music folks.While I like both releases ( though I feel that Mezmerize is the stronger of the two ) , I have to give this business decision to screw people by making them pay 28 dollars for 2 releases that could 've ( and should 've ) been put on just one CD just one star.Burn both CD 's onto just one 80 minutes CDR and listen to them all the way through from start to finish . It makes a very cohesive listening experience and makes the whole even stronger than the parts.I 'm surprised that more reviews on here have n't mentioned that SOAD are making people pay double for just 76 minutes of music.That bothers me , but then again , the albums ARE really good stuff and really catch the band in an incredible transitional period which really makes me excited to see where they go next.Hopefully the rumors of them splitting up are just that , rumors.I 'm a fan back from the beginning when they first came out and I think they 've just gotten stronger and stronger with each release .	1
After nearly 4 years since their last official studio effort ( not counting 2003 's `` Steal This Album ! '' ) System Of A Down boldly returned in May with their newest offering `` Mezmerize '' . `` Mezmerize '' proved to be well worth the wait , and when I heard that it would be the first part of a double album , the second part being released 6 months after , I was very excited . But after the excellent return with `` Mexmerize '' , where did that leave SOAD to go ? `` Hynotize '' clearly answers that question by being one of the best and most refreshing rock/metal albums of the year . Everything you 've ever loved about SOAD is fully intact on the release , and in fact is much better than it has ever been . `` Hypnotize '' is everything its predessecor `` Mezmorize '' was and more , making it a must hear for all fans.Opening up with the blistering anthem `` Attack '' , System of A Down ups the ante on all levels . `` Attack '' features amazingly well written lyrics about our government and its nact for attacking things that do n't necessarily need attacked , however it 's not just the typical `` no war in Iraq '' song . No SOAD relates how our own government could eventually turn around and just attack us all , because they could . The excellent lyrics of Serj and Daron 's lyrics are just as impressive as always on the release , something which I have always loved about the band . Songs like `` Kill Rock And Roll '' and `` Hypnotize '' are fairly different from anything the band has written before , and pieces like `` Stealing Society '' and `` U-Fig '' recall their roots from their Self-Titled album . Musically the band is on the same level as `` Mezmerize '' , which is not a bad thing at all . Daron gives a great performance on guitar , throwing out thrash inspired riffs in heavier tunes like the afformentioned `` Stealing Society '' and `` Attack '' , but is also capable of laying down soft and intricate portions on thought provokers like `` Lonely Day '' and `` Soldier Side '' . If you listened to `` Mezmerize '' you probably noticed Daron 's increased time on the mic , which is carried over into this album as well . His vocals are n't bad by any means , but Serj Tankian has always been the reason why SOAD had such a unique sound , and really I 'd like to hear Serj more than Daron . As for Serj 's vocals , there are great like always , showing his usual range of zany stylings evident through out all the top tracks like `` Attack '' , `` Kill Rock And Roll '' and `` Stealing Society '' . Shavo Odajian and John Dolmayan back the band in stellar fashion once again and propel the heavier the songs , and well as balance the slower ones . The album moves at a great pace , and is 12 actual songs ( `` Mezmerize '' was 10 songs and an intro ) so you have plenty to choose from . Standouts include `` Attack '' , `` Kill Rock And Roll '' and `` Stealing Society '' .In the end `` Hypnotize '' is everything I hoped it would be and more . This clearly surpasses the precedent set by `` Mezmerize '' , and is one of the best albums you 're likely to hear this year . In typical fashion there is a nice variety of SOAD tunes found on this record , and all fans of the band are going to find something about this cd to enjoy . The cover art is particularly cool , and the way it fits with the cover of `` Mezmerize '' is very well done . Like `` Mezmerize '' before it , it 's nice to hear a great band like System Of A Down returning to top form in a time where the original movement they were a part of has slowly died away . This proves that the band was not just a product of their time , but a band with the power to stay years after they debuted . `` Hypnotize '' is a testament to that . Having the heavy , catchy tunes that initially drew us to the band , slow and introspective pieces that give the album depth , and plenty of craziness and politically charged lyrics to satisfy the most hardcore fans , `` Hypnotize '' is flat out a must hear release this year . Do n't delay .	1
I was struck down by the sheer genious of 'Mesmerize ' the songs were vibrant , topical and very dynamic . Rock songs with strange folk tunes in the middle was something I had never heard.When I put on 'Hypnotize ' the first song was a let down . Just a luggish metal song with a grunt . Nothing special.It did get better however . Was the experience as great as the first part of this double . No . But System Of A Down is still a unique band and one of the few bands that can still surprise me after listening to 1000s of records .	1
Well now this is more like it . I was a little disappointed after hearing mezmerize . Still a great cd but too much daron ! We want to hear SOAD not system of a daron some ppl said . Well this album is miles better than mezmerize . Right from the frenetic opener Attack to the closing song Soldier Side , this cd doesnt skip a beat well it does if im jumping around like a mofo but still . Fav songs on the album : Holy Mountains , Kill Rock N Roll and Stealing Society . I love this cd its so great as soon as you hear attack you just got ta listen to the whole thing.Buy it and prey that their next album after their hiatus will be just as good	1
System of A Down once again brings an exceptional release with HYPNOTIZE , the second half of the double album MEZMERIZE/HYPNOTIZE . The production by Rick Rubin is excellent as always with crazy driving guitars . The songwriting is just as polished as MEZMERIZED , though there is the lack of a hit say the caliber of `` B.Y.O.B . '' which did very well on the pop charts . I like the fact that System of Down thinks outside of the box rather than just being like everybody else . They are in an elitest group that I consider to include The Mars Volta , Coheed & Cambria , and even NIN . One positive thing that I like particular about this album is the humor on such tracks as `` She 's Like Heroin '' . I just love their who approach.My favorite songs are `` Attack '' , `` Kill Rock & Roll '' , `` Dreaming '' , `` Hypnotize '' , `` She 's Like Heroin '' , and `` Soldier Side '' . Very well done . There is no need to elaborate any more . SOAD is doing so many things right that it is hard to find anything to complain about . My biggest downer against them is that they should 've released MEZMERIZE/HYPNOTIZE as one album . For 36 Minutes and 39 minutes respectively , the album is just priced a bit much seperately . Where quality is concerned , this for me is one of the best rock releases of 2005 , easily .	1
A recent article in The Washington Post so accurately assessed that System of a Down luckily , and yet , unintentionally , rode the coattails of the nu-metal era , though it can not accurately be limited to the definition of nu-metal . Indeed , with the near death of that obviously baseless sound , System of a Down , unlike Korn , Limp Bizkit , Mudvayne , etc. , remains a Billboard behemoth because this Armenian foursome possesses a truly unique formula.The second half of its 2005 output , Hypnotize , to me , is much more of a logical step from Toxicity than the very good , yet still regressive , Mezmerize . Where that album toyed with a more tempered and simplistic formula , Hypnotize is a lethal dose of aggression and mayhem filtered through a refreshing maturity in the songwriting department.Possibly throwing a middle finger to the critics who question the musicianship of the group , Hypnotize contains System of a Down 's most impressive technical performance since its self-titled debut , hands down . I mean , in no way has this become a technical band , but the songs are far more dynamic , the time signature changes more frequent and complex , and the riffs noticeably more intricate . In fact , `` Lonely Day '' ( not one of my favorites ) contains a solo from Daron , which should put to rest the critique that he has limited ability while simultaneously highlighting the fact that he obviously does not believe in shameless self-glorification over song quality.And speaking of Daron , the primary songwriter for the band is featured more prominently on the vocals here , and though this has already tragically and predictably led to tabloid-maniacal fervor over the possible dissent in the ranks ( see aforementioned The Washington Post 11/20/05 article ) , Malakian 's added vocal role takes nothing away from Serj 's ability to command attention . Instead , the two attain a level of harmonization not present on any previous releases , and the result is SOAD 's most impressive vocal performance yet.This obvious cognizance and intent is what leads me to praise this release as a more fitting heir to the genius of Toxicity . I mean , I do enjoy Mezmerize , but that effort demonstrated standard SOAD originality , but no growth . With Hypnotize , you have the eerily composed and epic nature of `` Holy Mountains '' , the vocal oddities of `` U-Fig '' , the never attained before heaviness of `` Attack '' and `` Dreaming '' , and the ever-present intensity that was such a strength for Toxicity all coming together as evidence that this band has accurately identified its strong points , and is now ready to expand and exploit them.Whether it 's the to be expected quirkiness of tracks like `` Vicinity of Obscenity '' , or the cohesion of the title track , System of a Down has reaffirmed the widespread accolades it received for its monumental Toxicity . Retaining every bit of unrestrained fury and unmatched personality of that landmark release , Hypnotize also does what Mezmerize could not ; provides evidence that this is a band we have yet to hear the best of .	1
How many bands come out with two albums in one year ? `` Hypnotize , '' following closely behind the release of `` Memorize , '' is the stronger album of the two . Perhaps they were conceived as one larger project , I do n't know , but they are very similar . While not exactly a great band , SOAD is one of the more interesting groups putting out material today . A worthy follow-up to `` Toxicity . ''	1
I say this to justify my perspective on this band.I grew up on `` hard rock '' ( before metal ) , went through prog , punk , new wave , alternative , and everything in between . I always dreamed of a band that had the crunch of metal , the lyrical smarts of punk , and the musical ambitions of progressive music . System of a Down is the culmination of those dreams . `` Toxicity '' is my favorite hard rock album ever . And System of a Down is easily one of the five or ten greatest live bands that I 've ever seen -- and I 've seen a lot of great bands . They 're the most important band making music today -- better than Radiohead , U2 , or any other pretender , if you ask me . They are Hall of Fame material , if by then there is any justice regarding selection.Anyway , `` Hypnotize '' is n't quite as good as `` Toxicity '' , but it 's better than `` Mesmerize '' , with greater lyrical depth , fabulous songs , impressive musicianship , and terrific vocal harmonies . I 'm not going to dispute the fact that Serj 's vocals are better than Daron 's , but their tandem vocals complement each other well , adding a musical wrinkle they did n't have on `` Toxicity '' . A couple of songs near the end tend to flag , but the album ends with a bang , and the first two-thirds of the album is flat out awesome if you ask me . I would say it 's SOAD 's second best album , which only makes it one of the best damn CDs ever made.Did I mention I 'm 51 # & @ $ ing years old ?	1
Mezmerize had alot of songs that were catchy such as `` BYOB '' `` Revenga '' and `` Violent Pornography '' Hypnotize is very similar to Mezmerize being very agressive with songs such as `` Attack '' and `` Kill RockNRoll '' System of a Down has always been known for their great song writing , and they really have shown it on these last to albums `` Hypnotize '' and `` Mezmerize '' The remain to hit # 1 albums on Billboard because of their unique still in song writing vocally performing their songs . With agression tone and sure madness . If you bought any other Systeem of a Down CD , this is a great buy and a great follow up to `` Mezmerize ''	1
Rather than review each portion of this album separately ( Mesmerize/Hypnotize ) , I 've decided to review the collection as one whole . First , I find it amusing that when `` Mesmerize '' came out 6 months ago , everyone thought that it was great . Fast forward to now and the response seems partially luke warm with some being outright negative towards `` Hypnotize '' . I think had this second part to the overall album just been released as a double album , everyone would have loved it . Perhaps the band made a miscue by dividing the releases apart from one another ? Or perhaps System Of A Down has hit the beginning of their popularity downslide . This seems to be the case with any artist : once they hit their popularity peak , there 's nowhere to go but down . Granted , U2 has seemingly defied those odds by consistently releasing bad albums that the public herald as `` classic '' but for the rest of the bands on Earth , it 's all a game of how long they can stay atop the wave before they get sucked into the current.I 'll put it this way : `` Toxicity '' was truly a landmark album for this band . It not only made System Of A Down a household name but beyond the hype , it is an album of truly great songs . They established themselves an identity and broke far and away from the term nu-metal all in one fell swoop . Naturally , this album will likely always be their benchmark with most people and though it 's not their most creative album by any stretch , the strength of the songs solidified it as a truly classic album . With `` Mesmerize/Hypnotize '' , you might be able to scrape together a similar amount of strong songs between the two as you got with `` Toxicity '' by itself . From my perspective , System Of A Down has grown creatively and musically since `` Toxicity '' and the level of experimentation is obvious but in the end , they may have sacrificed the opportunity to `` strike while the iron is hot '' in terms of having songs the world will love.To that , I say who cares what the world wants . The world 's ( namely America ) music audience has a very short attention span and it always will . Though I think System Of A Down has hit a weird period in their career , I think the combination of creativity and songwriting is going to result in their best works in the future . Unfortunately , with some people seemingly already jumping ship , who knows how many people will still be around to enjoy it .	1
You people should stop your complaining immediatly ! I bought the dualdisc today and I was not let doen one bit . The CD is great , the DVD side is awesome and that 's it.Mainly , the best part is the CD ! ! ! ! ! Here , we have 12 amazing tracks by an amazing band called System Of A Down . It has many great tracks such as Hypnotize , She 's Like Heroin , and Vicinity Of Obscenity.The DVD is cool , with a so-so documentary and 2 music videos hard to find on TV.It is worth all the money .	1
Hypnotize is a great metal album . I really like Mesmerize , but i think Hypnotize is more raw and furious . All the two Mesmerize and Hypnotize are great , with many high moments.Hypnotize is even better and heavier than Mesmerize .	1
Disappointing . It 's as if they put all their good songs on Mezmerize and the 12 leftovers on Hypnotize.- Hypnotize 's songs do n't even come close to the intensity of Mezmerize and Toxicity . Sometimes the songs are even mellow sounding.- The songs are more political , and there 's lots of words , and it could sound better- I could handle Daron 's voice in Mezmerize , but he does n't even try to sing in Hypnotize . Serj is n't as good as before either . It 's just different- In Mezmerize , when Serj and Daron sung together there was amazing harmony and counterpoint . In Hypnotize , sub-par.FINAL THOUGHT : The songs are n't that bad really ... it 's just that Mezmerize and Toxicity are too good .	1
Well , after Mezmerize left me with a great , but ultimately far too small taste of the new direction System is now taking , I of course had to wait impatiently for this second half to be released . I loved Mezmerize , and aside from the somewhat mediocre `` BYOB , '' I thought it could compete face to face with any of System 's other albums . It was n't perfect , in my opinion , as it had some of System 's laziest lyrics . But it was still a shocking revelation of how much System has grown and matured . Instead of slowly deteriorating and giving in to the wishes of short-sighted marketing executives like almost every other band from this era of metal , SOAD continues to create art and progress . For a more in depth opinion of Mezmerize , I have written a separate review , but of course this is a review of Hypnotize ... .and to be honest , I was disappointed upon first listen . The songs just would n't gel for me , did n't grab me emotionally like the best songs on Mezmerize . But this turns out to be a bit of a grower ( albeit it a very fast one ) : three spins and I was hooked . Sure , it does n't resemble the self-titled in quite as many ways as Mezmerize did . But it takes those elements that Mezmerize brought back into the equation and develops them even furthur . The frenetic , progressive Mr. Bungle-esque time shifts and dissonances are more seamlessly combined with the melodic sentiments carried over from the Toxicity days to create a new sound of sorts . System is going forward and wo n't be looking back anytime soon.One major difference between Mezmerize and Hypnotize is variety - while Mezmerize had a more interesting variety of different sounds ( `` Old School Hollywood , '' `` Cigaro , '' and `` Question '' for example , ) Hypnotize shows a more cohesive sense of flow . Many of these songs are the same blend of addictive melody and old school SOAD punk-metal energy . This can work for or against the album , depending on your preferences . Either way , though , it splits this `` double album '' into two distinct albums . And all for the better ... who wants to sit around and listen to the same sound for 80 minutes ? Another major difference is this : Hypnotize is easily the darkest SOAD album since the self-titled . Even my friends who are n't particularely sentimental or over emotional when it comes to music say that this album does something to them ... it hits a nerve somewhere . A lot of the best examples are towards the end , like `` Holy Mountains '' which I see as being a far more mature successor to `` Ariels '' and one of the best songs on this album . After the comic relief of `` Vicinity of Obscenity '' comes the ungodly creepiness of `` She 's Like Heroin . '' Despite sloppy lyrics , `` Lonely Day '' is still a haunting melody . And of course there 's the full version of `` Soldier Side '' which sends chills down my spine still after listening to this album for a week.Even in many of the other songs , this emotional intensity can be found in assorted choruses and bridges . `` U-Fig '' seems to have a Dredg-like antsy quality to it and the apocalyptic `` Tentative '' foreshadows the too-close-for-comfort intensity of the last few songs on the album ( and at the same time manages to evoke the meloncholic vibe of Steal This Album 's better songs . ) The title track was the perfect choice for single , and it was the first song to grow on me . In many ways it is the oldest-sounding song and could have been a track off of the self-titled if it were not for Daron 's lead vocalizing . By the way , while I 'm on this subject , I would like to share my opinions on Daron 's voice ; many people seem to unfairly dismiss new System solely based on his voice . While I will admit that he does n't have the `` nicest '' or most well trained voice , I could cite dozens of worse singers in any form of popular music . He may not have the outright beauty of Serj 's voice , but he has style and energy that I think benefit this new direction System is going in . Besides , Daron is n't REPLACING Serj , the two voices are simply playing point and counterpoint . If anything , Daron-critics should like Hypnotize more because it has more Serj than Mezmerize did.People who complain that this album is n't enough like the `` old '' System need to stop being nostalgic whiners that are afraid of change . System of a Down have changed as a band , matured , developed - and thank God for that ! Had they stayed the same to appease the fanatics , they 'd be down the drain with all those other nu metal bands . I could n't be happier with the changes System has made . I will always have a place in my heart for the self-titled , it was my favorite album for a long time and I do n't think they 'll be able to top it in my book ... but I would rather they change and continue to become a different band that makes more cds that are great in their own unique way than drive the same formula into the ground repeatedly until I stop liking them altogether . In art , change is survival . Learn to embrace that concept , or be left behind - your choice .	1
2005 was the best year for new music I 've seen since 2001 . Sigur R & oacute ; s , Opeth , The Mars Volta , and the Eels all put out extremely strong efforts . However , after a few listens to this , I can say that it tops anything else I 've heard that was released last year.Each song rolls off the stereo with a certain `` oomph ; '' an energy that 's very hard to replicate . They sound kind of like early-Metallica-era speed metal ... but then you start thinking , and they really sound more like the sort of juicy psychedelic pop bands like Jefferson Airplane and Country Joe and the Fish churned out `` back in the day . '' All of a sudden , you realize that they 're singing about some pretty heavy stuff , like genocide and air raids ( `` Tentative '' features an eerie chorus with the line `` no one will save us now , not even God '' ) ... and terracotta pie and `` ghosts of hooker girly dudes . '' The album is great for bouts of extreme depression ... and bouts of extreme euphoria too . It is a little bit of all the simple joys and terrors of this world packed into a 40-minute CD.Is this as good as Mezmerize ? It depends on what you 're looking for . Mezmerize seems more like a cohesive whole than a colleciton of songs ... but Hypnotize definately has some of that `` collection of songs '' vibe to it . However , the songs here are much more interesting and well-developed in my opinion . It 's scary just how good System of a Down has gotten at writing amazing pop songs . They have now reached a point where they can write a song with hokey-sounding lyrics on paper ( `` the most lonliest day in my liiiiiiiife '' ) that WORKS like nothing else and actually has an emotional impact . If you like pop , metal , rock , or just plain interesting music , this is well worth your time . Yes , it is fairly `` mainstream '' in terms of sales , but it sounds nothing like all those awful contrived fake-metal bands out there . Trust me : this is the real deal right here . From the sudden onslaught of `` Attack '' to the false calm created by the acoustic bits of `` U-Fig '' to the masterpiece that is `` Soldier Side , '' Hypnotize resembles a sonic orgasm.And yes ... in case you were wondering , Serj sings a lot more here than on Mezmerize . Not only does he take the lead more frequently , but his harmonizing sounds signifcantly stronger . These guys are getting pretty close to The Beatles as far as vocal harmonies go .	1
` Hypnotize ' is the second half of the double album release from SOAD and as I mentioned on my ` Mezmerize ' review , the sound is slightly ( but only slightly ) different to past albums , but still manages to retain their own distinctive style . You get their unique sound , great lyrics and vocals and as much passion as on all their other albums . ` U-Fig ' is a particular favourite and I could listen to ` Holy Mountains ' over and over ( and frequently do ! ) where the passion and vitriol shines through oh so clearly . ` Lonely Day ' was released as a single and EP and is a great softer track on this album before leading you to the album closer ` Soldier Side ' , which links the two albums together ( it is the opener on ` Mezmerize ' ) and it sandwiches the tracks in between perfectly . Again , the artwork is great and Rick Rubin is at the producing helm crafting another superb album . Worth a listen for all fans of SOAD and a top album in general.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page .	1
I ca n't think of any other band that sounds like these guys . They are truly unique and although I do n't like everything that they do , there is certainly a lot of talent to be found here . The music combines elements of Nu-metal , progressive rock , and Zappa-ish mayhem . Some of it is funny , some serious and some just plain over the top . Lead vocalist Serj Tankian has an almost operatic voice that is very different from anyone else I can think of out there . The band remind me a bit of The Mars Volta at times , although SOD 's music is more blunt and to the point . Highlights include `` Attack '' , `` Kill Rock N Roll '' , `` Lonely Day '' , and `` Soldier Side '' . This is a band that I have to be in the right mood to listen to , and I kind of have to take them in small doses , but there is no doubt that SOD are one of the more unique bands in mainstream rock today .	1
`` Hypnotize , '' the second half of System of a Down 's 2005 opus , is clearly a continuation of their first album , `` Mezmerize '' ( which was released in May ) . In addition to not being very far removed musically from `` Mezmerize , '' this album also follows about the same blueprint . The songs on `` Hypnotize '' are very corky and energetic . It combines jokes with serious , bold political messages , and heavy songs ( `` Stealing Society '' ) with slower , ballad-esque numbers ( `` Lonely Day '' ) . Plus , many of the songs have several tempo changes . ( `` Dreaming '' combines `` Chop Suey '' -esque singing with tempo changes that bring `` B.Y.O.B . '' to mind , and `` U-Fig '' and `` Holy Mountains '' are chaotic , off-the-wall tunes with whiplash speed changes and even acoustic guitar breakdowns . ) And , finally , guitarist/songwriter Daron Malankian gets more time at the mic than he did on the band 's first two albums . But most of his singing , here , is actually pretty good . ( Track one , `` Attack '' begins with fast , ultra-crunchy riffs , before Daron begins to croon nasally , and he actually sounds as good as Serj . ) '' She 's Like Heroin '' goes absolutely no where , and `` Vicinity of Obscenity '' is so silly , it could be a `` Steal This Album '' b-side . But most of these songs are very good and there are a few mature moments ( i.e . `` Kill Rock ` N Roll '' and the title track ) , which sound more along the lines of a traditional System of a Down song.Upon my first listening to this album , I was not at all impressed . I thought System were trying too hard to be funny , but usually ended up coming across as goofy . Fortunately , however , I gave this disc repeated spins and it grew on me quite a lot . So I recommend you do the same ; buy it , and give it time to sink under your skin ( something it will most definitely do ) . It is n't a great C.D. , but it 's still quite good , and worth buying if you 're a fairly big SOAD fan ; if you 're a casual fan , however , you will probably be satisfied with just one of System 's five records .	1
This may be System Of A Down 's best offering to the human ear . For fans and critics , your LOVE THEM/HATE THEM attitude , this album is for you.As with every album of theirs you are taken on a journey ... ... ..into sound through arrangements , to places in your mind that seem to last for hours yet the albums on average are about 39 minutes long.Though 'Mezmerize ' ( it 's counterpart ) with its mature yet lazy attitude seemed a little hollow as a whole now seems to make sense . With 'Hypnotize ' there is a sense of urgency with a big bold sound behind it . One that fully surpasses 'Mezmerize 's greatest moments.The Dualdisc adds a bit more with two videos and a somewhat lackluster look at the making of both albums.Separate they are great albums but together they become a unique package that interlocks with wonderful artwork.With 'Mezmerize/Hypnotize ' you 're traveling on a quest for knowledge . If you have n't gotten on the ride yet ... ..you might have missed it ... ... .	1
Of the two major SOAD releases this year , I personally like this one a lot more . For me , what pushes Hypontize from 4 to 5 is the more consistent tone . It rocks from end to end , whereas Mesmerize has quieter moments . SOAD is great in those moments , but I think the momentum on Hyp is a lot better modulated.I almost did n't give this 5 stars because the guitarist , God love him , should stick up to backup vocals . His voice is n't bad at all -- it just does n't mesh like Tankian 's masculine spasticness does . It works well on the title track , in my opinion , but he simply sounds too juvenile compared to the rest of the sound , which is decidedly muscular and punchy.I have to say though , that terra cotta pie is damnable thing to get drilled into your brain right after diving into the fantastic and chilling `` Holy Mountains , '' probably the most epic song SOAD has crafted . Terra cotta terra cotta ... ack ! ! `` Vicinity of Obscenity '' might have been better off as the last track . Or a hidden track . Or not on the album : pWhile `` Stealing Society '' felt a little unimaginative , and `` Lonely Day '' was pretty emo for my tastes , I find something to enjoy out of every other track on the album . On `` Tenative , '' it 's the gorgeous harmonizing on the chorus and refrain , and the haunting lyrics -- listen close for a pronoun change when they talk about falling bombs . On `` U-Fig , '' it 's the hilarious dynamic changes , which I picture jarring the squares out of their seats . `` Soldier Side , '' the most approachable track on the album in my opinion , is once again edgy with the lyrics , gorgeous on the harmoning , and haunting with those minor chords.Oh , and these guys will metal your socks off , too .	1
Easily one of Daron Malakian 's best lyrics on an album packed with memorable , quotable sentiments and images . The incredible title track is one of System 's best songs ever and confirms what longtime fans have known for a decade , SOAD is one of the most innovative , musically accomplished and genuinely brilliant bands of the 21st century . Everything on `` Hypnotize '' works , from the thrashing , warp speed rockers , to the longer ( for this band anyway ) tracks , most notably the excellent `` Holy Mountains '' . My biggest relief ; the fact that the band has n't lost its sense of humor , songs like the shapeshifting `` Vicinity of Obscenity '' and the herky-jerky `` She 's Like Heroin '' are two of my favorites , in short , I 'm glad these guys are still weird and proud of it . This LP is a very intense , 40 minute scream that almost never lets up , but leaves the listener both exhilarated and exhausted .	1
2005 saw System of a Down release two albums in the year , the second one which connects the liner notes to the first . I 've been a SOAD fan for a few years now . I had huge expectations for hearing new SOAD since I loved `` Toxicity '' so much , and got around to buying the other albums by then . I was totally blown away by `` Mezmerize , '' and I know it 's an unpopular opinion , but to me , that 's the best work they 've done . Every song on there is wonderful , and while it may not have been too serious , it was kind of refreshing to hear , and only two songs were actually political.Here comes the sequel to that one , `` Hypnotize . '' In my opinion , the other album was a lot more moving , but this one is n't too bad . The hits `` Hypnotize '' and `` Lonely Day '' are okay , but for me , they are not what SOAD are best at . The former is well-performed but to me seems like it was kind of written to be a hit more than connect with the band 's artistry . The latter has some of the band 's weakest lyrics , never getting in depth on what makes the day so depressing/lonely . A tale of a prostitute and drag queen on `` She 's Like Heroin '' is okay , but that 's not really one of my favorite songs from the group , either.This album is far more political than `` Mezmerize , '' but many of the songs deal with the Armenian genocide issues . The greatest songs , for me , do n't match with the other disc , but it is still pretty good . Not as quick and quirky as the predecessor , but songs like `` Stealing Society '' and `` Vicinity of Obscenity '' show the group has plenty of creativity in them and are totally exciting to hear . It is also a more bleak album than the past one , speaking of some hopelessness in `` Tentative , '' `` Holy Mountains , '' and `` Soldier Side . '' That being said , all of those are great songs . While not as speedy as its counterpart , it still has edginess in the majority of the album . Like everything SOAD , not everyone will connect with it as it is an acquired taste.As for lumping the guys with n & uuml ; -metal : They transcend the sub-genre . They play faster than most of the mid-tempo groups and also unlike those , they change the tempos more often and have loads of creativity . It 's not just teenage angst . `` Hypnotize '' is definitely a worthy listen and worth adding to your musical collection . Even when SOAD do n't make completely amazing music for me , it is still excellent .	1
Of course what 's not to love . This is MJB ! I love her music .	1
The Breakthrough has bought Mary back with avengence . There is no competition and the pain and the triumph gets no more real than it is here . This album is for everyone , there 's a message in at least on of the tracks on this album . Buy it at your own risk , it is addictive !	1
I could not wait to write a review about this album . First off I have to say , This is one of the best albums I have heard in a long time . Every single song on this album is a cut , not just good but a cut . No one can sing like Mary , and no one can bring songs to life like her . You get everything on this album , great songs ( writing is really good ) , tight beats , and great singing . This is by far my favorite album of Mary 's . I give every single song no less than a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10 . I really did n't expect it to be this good.This album is packed with some old school vibe type cuts , and some with the new sound ( i.e . be without you ) . Do n't be fooled , Be without you is a great song but it is not the best song on the album , everything is just as good . This will be Mary 's biggest album I predict , I did n't skip one song on the album , nor was I even tempted to . Each one has some kind of meaning behind it that makes you want to keep listening to it just to see what 's she 's going to say next . I love the way you can just feel and hear the struggle in her voice on some songs.Classic album , hands down the best R & B ; cd to come out this year , it leaves everything in the dust . This is a must have , and it 's only $ 8.99 ! at CircuitCity . Get this and you will not be dissappointed .	1
Great Album By Mary J. Blidge . This is the second Album Of Hers I Purchased , and another Album Where All Songs On It Are Hits . This Shows The True Talent Of A Musical Artist . Great Price . Worth The Buy .	1
The Breakthrough is a slamming affair with just the right panache of tragedy , angst , forlonnery and salvation . Mary lets us know that the pain that she went through makes her a stronger woman . Every track has a hidden message about love gained , love lost , love that should have never been caught , etc.She takes us on a epiliptical journey through the nothings of the heart . Just looking at the title , people may think that this is a dismal album , but truth be told , it 's not . Each and every song has a lesson earned and learned . Mary utilizes Will.I.am , Jam , Lewis , Saddiq and a slew of other artist to help her capture the spirit of this album . I love the entire album .	1
Mary is finally back with songs that are actually worth hearing ! That Diddy reunion on Love and Life was not working at all . And she is actually singing for once , not screaming . My favorite songs are `` I Found My Everything '' and `` Father in You '' . The faster-paced songs do n't really move me : although she 's the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul , that sound does n't work for her anymore . She sounds more comfortable with ballads .	1
Here 's another example how over hyping an album turned me away from it to a degree . Nevertheless I just finally gave it a chance and first off I have to say it 's a far more inspired album overall than her previous release to thisLove & Life . That 's not to say they do n't have they 're similarities . Songs such as `` Enough Cryin '' and `` Gon na Breakthrough '' are heavy on the rap , both featuring Brook but that is n't a bad thing because both songs are really strong , funky and dancable hip-hop soul/funk . Same story goes `` About You '' with Will I Am and `` No One Will Do '' . One thing that might settle differently with other listeners about this album is the numerous lyrical references to what she 's `` been through '' and how she came over them to let us now about it empowered her . Not a bad thing at all on the surface but if your aware of Mary J 's career thus far it 's a concept she 's by this point long ago worn into the ground so she was more than repeating herself on that note considering that was the entire concept ofNo More Dramawhen you got right down to it . Three of the most impressive songs on this album are `` Good Woman Down , '' Ca n't Hide From Luv '' and `` Ca n't Get Enough '' -all of which showcase a strong grounding in the Chicago funk/soul style that grounded Mary J 's music in it 's 70 's based tradition for quite awhile at this point and they are part of the glue that holds this album together . On `` MJB Da MVP '' she 's actually looking back on her musical past and talking of how her career moves . And on we go to the last part of the album where her whole outlook comes to an important conclusion . `` I Found Everything '' brings in Raphael Saadiq in for a gospel/soul tune that owes a lot to Mary 's connection witht eh late 60 's Aretha Franklin Atlantic era recordings . `` Father In You '' and `` Alone '' again dip into the funk , not just in terms of music but against lyrical ideas about semi-Freudian relationships revolving around men . `` Father In You '' strikes a very important chord with me because how similarly it relates to someone I know who 's had similar experiences . Of course this also contains `` One '' , a duet with U2 and although it 's an very compelling hybrid of both of their dramatic musical styles . Even if , considering the fact Bono in particular seemed to be everywhere during this period the concept seemed all too obvious . This is kind of a new beginning for Mary J . In the end I still have to say though thatMy LifeandMaryare still her finest overall recorded achievements thus far .	1
This album is clearly one of the best R'n'B albums in a long time . I have n't really been much of a Mary J Blige fan before , but this album is just FANTASTIC . It has the numbers you wan na dance to like Enough Cryin and Baggage and nice slow songs like the first single Be Without You . Mary sings with so much soul and passion and you can really feel what she 's been through . Her vocals are also so soothing yet amazing , especially on songs like It Ai n't Really Love . Mary should keep up this fantastic work because I really feel for her . Also , her re-make of U2 's One ( in which U2 actually duet on the track with her ) is absolutely brilliant . If you were dissapointed with Love & Life , or even if you were n't , I strongly suggest you try out this amazing effort by one of the best R'n'B female singers of all-time .	1
I have been a Mary J. Blige fan since her heyday in the early ` 90s ; in fact , I even remember when she used to sing backup for Father MC . But while her first four albums were great , her next two albums were kind of average . Also , as my brother said , her voice was starting to weaken . But as soon as I first heard `` Be Without You '' on the radio , I was blown away and I had a feeling she was making a comeback . And she does just that on The Breakthrough.There are great songs aplenty on here , so it 's hard to pick any one as the favorite . But introspective tracks duly impress , like `` Father In You '' and the motivational `` Good Woman Down '' . `` Baggage '' is also stellar , as it has Mary telling her man that she 's not bringing her problems to THEIR relationship or blaming him for them ( why ca n't MORE women say things like tha -- never mind ) .Other highlights include `` Take Me As I Am '' , the cover of U2 's `` One '' ( complete with U2 ) , and the Raphael Saadiq-assisted `` I Found My Everything '' . And while I never really cared for Mary 's rapping alter-ego Brook-lyn , the rap in `` Enough Cryin '' actually makes a great song even better . That always is n't the case , though , as evidenced by `` Gon na Breakthrough '' .There are n't many fast songs to be found on here , which is good because that 's what brought her last two albums down ; case in point : I did n't care for the hidden bonus track . And the musical timeline found in `` MJB Da MVP '' would be great if it was n't for the lazy sample of a sample ( it lifts 50 Cent 's chorus from Game 's `` Hate It Or Love It '' ) . The album as a whole is also a tad long at 73 minutes.But The Breakthrough is still great . Take heed , though : do n't buy this expecting another What 's the 411 or My Life . Just enjoy the album for what it is , and I 'm sure you 'll be as pleased with it as I am.Anthony Rupert	1
One of the most gifted vocalists of our time , Mary J. Blige offers up what is most definitely her strongest work to date with The Breakthrough . With absolutely NO FILLER whatsoever , this album is full of back-to-back strong up and down-temp R & B tracks , ballads and aching songs of love lost and heartache . Mary J 's voice soars on tracks like No One Will Do , Take Me as I Am and Enough Cryin . Collaborations with Will.i.Am , Jay Z and U2 ( ! ) add additional value and originality to this groundbreaking album . With first single , Be Without You , Mary J offers what is her strongest performance since the haunting No More Drama , and with songs like Ai n't Really Love and Alone , this album is a very likely candidate for album of the year !	1
recieved earlier than expected , All of the MJ cd 's i have recently purchased is an anniversary gift to my sister in law , She loves this artist , And boy will she be surprised when she recieves this gift .	1
The Breakthrough~ Mary J. Blige is a real well done album . The sound is crisp and the studio production is top notch . Ms Blige has amazing vocal skills and the lyrics are well written and heart felt without sounding forced or contrite . The book-let is very nice but I am perplexed by the decision to make it fold like a poster and gets minus points . Ms Blige is a very beautifull woman but some of the outfits make her look a bit too ghetto and that does not fit a lady . The cover photo is absolutely stunning and she looks like a greek goddess . I highly recommend this album to fans of good r & b and to good music in general .	1
THIS ALBUM IS A TRUE HIPHOPSOUL CLASSIC.IT COMBINES THE SOUL THAT WAS IN THE ALBUMS'NO MORE DRAMA ' , 'LOVE & LIFE ' , 'MY LIFE ' & ALL THEM OTHER OLD ALBUMS ... AT THIS POINT ITS EVEN DIFFICULT FOR ME TO TELL WHICH ALBUM WAS HER BEST..BECAUSE SHE IS THE BEST	1
This is a breakthrough CD for Mary . With her excellent melodies and heartfelt voice . You will be able to feel every emotion that Mary feels when she sings it to you . I highly recommend this CD for all the Mary J. Blige fans !	1
Mary J is phenomenal . Plain and simple . Who else can say that they are one of the main reasons a lot of the up-and-coming Hip-Hop inspired R & B ; singers are cropping up and vying for your attention on the airwaves ? Everybody from Ciara to Ashanti to Teairra Mari to Nivea to whoever else you can name have one woman to thank ... .and she is STILL the reigning Queen of Hip-Hop Soul . Sure , she had her own obstacles along the way , both career-related and her personal battles as well . But like most strong Black women , she persevered and made due with what she had to get through . Failed relationships , overbearing producers , a demanding record label , and an equally anxious fan base all make up the huge undertaking that Miss MJB is left to handle . After a disappointing showing with Love & Life , Mary takes a step back and goes for broke with The Breakthrough , an album that undeniably puts her back on the right track.Track for track , Mary represents to the fullest . `` No One Will Do '' and `` Enough Cryin '' set the tone for the rest of the album . Will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas makes a disheartening showing on `` About You . '' This is n't because of any bogus lyrics , but rather a verse that makes you wish he was still rapping like the Peas used to do on their first two albums ! Alas , we are talking about Mary J and not the man I 've deemed the Black version of Sideshow Bob . `` Be Without You '' was probably the best choice for a radio single , with `` Alone '' featuring Dave Young ( who sounds suspiciously like another crooner named Dave Hollister ) and `` Ca n't Hide From Luv '' featuring Jay-Z as two of the best choices for follow-up singles . You know Mary had to represent for the struggle with uplifting songs like `` Good Woman Down '' and `` Take Me As I Am '' fulfilling those looking for an encouraging word or two . `` Baggage '' and `` Ai n't Really Love '' are the songs dedicated to the no good men out there . And besides `` Be Without You , '' the mushy stuff shows up on the fascinating `` Ca n't Get Enough '' and the captivating `` I Found My Everything '' featuring Raphael Saadiq.By no means does this review give you the whole picture , but I ca n't help but say that you 'd really be doing yourself a disservice by not purchasing this album . It 's probably the best album since the Mary album , and that 's really an understatement . Mary J. Blige gives it to you and more with The Breakthrough , and hopefully her new focus will help her stick around for years to come .	1
Mary J. Blige debuted in 1992 with her album `` What 's the 411 '' and her hit song `` Real Love '' . Immediately , she garnered tremendous respect from the critics and the fans . She was immediately named `` The Queen of Hip Hop '' . Throughout her career , she has always stayed on top of her game , recording wonderful R & B ; and hip-hop songs . Fourteen years later , she remains The Queen , and more amazingly , she has garnered more success this decade than in the 90 's . She has since been compared to legendary artists Aretha Franklin , Patti LaBelle , and Dionne Warwick.Her seventh studio album `` The Breakthrough '' is exactly that . She needs no more than the title to explain how amazing of an artist she is on this album . Through every song on this album , she writes , produces , and performs to the fullest of her capabilities . She places her personal pain , heartbreak , and trials on these songs . Compared to some of her past material , she shows much more maturity on `` The Breakthrough '' , which shows that she takes risks and tries to evolve as an artist . Her biggest risk is admitting her weak side in life . The best example is her hit single `` Be Without You '' , admitting that though her man treats her wrong , she ca n't stop loving him.Her performances prove that she is truly one of the best R & B ; artists of modernday . Few from this genre have matched or beat her . She expresses her emotions and heartbreak to the fullest , never holding back . She proves in this album that contemporary R & B ; can contain soul , not just grooves . Her collaborations fit the individual songs well : Brook , Will.i.am of The Black Eyed Peas , Raphael Saadiq , Jay Z , and U2 . Her versatality shows that she can cross genres and still sound great . Surely , since many know how amazing of an artist she is , it is not necessary to explain any fuller of her talent.Therefore , `` The Breakthrough '' is an essential for any Mary J. Blige or R & B ; fan . This album is sure to please a variety of its listeners . ***Expect Mary J. Blige to receive at least six 2006 Grammy nominations : Best Contemporary R & B ; Album , Best Female R & B ; Performance ( `` Be Without You '' ) , Best R & B ; Song ( `` Be Without You '' ) , Best R & B ; Performance by a Group , Duo , or Band ( `` I Found My Everything '' w/ Raphael Saadiq ) , Best Rap/ Sung Performance ( `` Enough Cryin ' '' w/ Brook ) , and Best Pop Collaboration ( `` One '' w/ U2 ) .	1
When Mary J Blige 's new CD `` The Breakthrough '' arrived in the mail , I rushed to put it in the CD player . Mary is back better than ever before . She 's been the unofficial spokesperson for women everywhere . On `` The Breakthrough , '' Mary sings about being in a healthy relationship and self empowerment . `` Be Without You '' is just one of many songs that you 'll find yourself loving . This is by far her best CD in years . Although I like the entire CD , the six songs I mention below ( in my opinion ) are strong enough to be released as singles and are certified hits.Mary starts the CD off by celebrating love with `` No One Will Do . `` `` Enough Cryin '' talks about getting out of a dead end relationship . The song reminds me of `` Not Gon na Cry '' from the Waiting to Exhale soundtrack.The lyrics `` take me as I am or have nothing at all ... I can only be me '' is from the song `` Take Me As I Am . '' I can see this as being a women 's anthem song.Mary reminds me of Chaka Khan in `` Ca n't Hide from Luv . `` She breaks it down in `` Ai n't Really Love . `` Mary sang a classic when she sang `` I Found My Everything . '' An equivalent song would be `` Inseparable '' by Natalie Cole . If you 're not in love , after hearing `` I Found My Everything , '' it 'll make you want to be in love.Let Mary take you on a musical journey as she celebrates life and love on The Breakthrough-you wo n't be disappointed .	1
Is there a breakthrough ? Not in style . But on her seventh disc , hip-hop/soul queen Mary J. Blige has never sounded better . The production is slick and meticulous ; the cameos including Raphael Saadiq , U2 and producers Curtis Jackson , Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis , Rodney Jerkins have glossed up Mary J. Blige 's effort . In the first part of the CD , Ms. Blige bursts into love and affirmation for her producer husband Kendu with a catchy piano-based tune `` Be Without You '' and the heart-thumping `` No one will do '' . `` Gon na Breakthrough '' and `` MjB da MVP '' are feel-good songs that demonstrate Ms. Blige 's perfect sense of rhythm and dance vibes . At this point , one might have think that Ms. Blige has lost its emotional gravity but fear not - for `` Good woman down '' is a rip-roaring anthem to encourage woman to confront their abuses ; `` Baggage '' , `` Father in You '' and `` Ai n't Really Love '' illustrates her past heartbreaks and hopes excruciatingly . Ms. Blige gives perhaps one of her best performance in `` I found My Everything '' that captures the energy seen in legend Aretha Franklin . The song `` One '' with U2 summons our conscience to help our brothers and sisters . Though the beats of the music are addictive , Ms. Blige grounds it with her fiery pipes and a better sense of control compared to her effort in `` No More Drama '' . Fans will welcome back Mary for this is her most consistent album to date . Love has certainly done her good .	1
Album The Breakthrough je daleko od odlicnog albuma ili najboljeg u karijeri velike Mary J. Blige , tako da nenasedate na kritike u kojima su pisani hvalospevi.Ovo je samo dobar album pun potencijalnih hitova , sa glasom koji nikada nije bolje sluzio Mary J. Blige.Mana ovog albuma je to sto se cini da je 17 pesama od kojih je jedna skrivena posle One ( 3/5 ) koju je Mary otpevala sa U2 previse t.j da je album prenatrpan , i to sto atmosfera albuma posle pesme Ca n't Get Enough ( 4/5 ) pocinje da pada . Nemojte pogresno da me razumete , nisam rekao da album prestaje posle jedanajste pesme i da ostale nisu dobre , ali jednostavno nesto nestima.Kakogod ako ste bili fan Mary J. Blige do sada ovo je album za vas . Da li moze da dobije nove fanove sa The Breakthrough ? Sumnjam , ali Mary je definitivno autenticna crna diva naseg vremena .	1
Let me tell you that this is Mary 's best in a while . Of course nothing tops `` My Life '' . Every track has a purpose and everything flows well . This one is definitely a keeper . Her shows are absolutely amazing , and if anyone gets the opportunity should check her out .	1
Mary did an excellent job with this CD . I agree with other reviewers that this is one of her best CD 's . I can truly relate to the song `` Father In You '' and am thankful that someone expressed the feelings of growing up not being a Daddy 's Girl and how painful it is and how not having a father in your life can make a dramatic difference on how you see the world . On `` Baggage '' she is stating how baggage can bring you down and can place your relationship in turmoil if you are n't careful . The blazing track `` Be Without You '' truly touches your heart especially if you are or have been in love . `` I Found My Everything '' is another beautiful song about love . I am so glad that another R & B star is shining brightly once more .	1
I love this CD . It 's great like her other releases . This album and the title is indicative of its focused passion . The album vibrates with energy , shimmers with vitality , radiates with hard earned truth and remind us of music 's healing power . The theme is about getting to or going to a place that we all fear the most . Her life affirming philosophy is evident on this album . Her musical palate reflects her lifelong affininty for old school soul and R & B and an unmistakable connection to hip hop . That fusion gives this album a jolt of energy . This album has been certified 3x Platinum .	1
The Breakthrough is Mary J. Blige 's seventh studio album and it 's one of the best albums that the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul has released in quite some time . Mary is in love and she appreciates her man and she wants the world to know . The Breakthrough opens up with the soulful number `` No One Will Do . '' This song is followed by the up-tempo `` Enough Cryin ' '' featuring new female rapper Brooke . This is one of those classic Mary songs about a no good man . Mary has realized that we are all happy that she is happy and in love but the fans who fell in love with her really related with the Mary who sang about pain and drama.The albums first single `` Be Without You '' is a beautiful ballad . Hustle & Flow star Terrance Howard star 's in the singles music video . `` Gon na Breakthrough '' is a decent album track that has a real early 90 's feel to it . `` Good Woman Down '' is a song Mary dedicates to the sistahs who loved her My Life album . She offers hope in this song . `` Take Me As I Am '' is an mid-tempo song with a real nice beat . The title `` Baggage '' makes one think this is a slow song but it 's actually a rather up-tempo song , which sounds a bit dated . `` Ca n't Hide From Love '' reunited Jay-Z and Mary J. Blige . Mary sounds a bit Aretha Franklin like in this song.It 's really great that Mary included `` MJB Da MVP '' on this album . This is Mary 's song that was released on mix tapes earlier this year . It 's Mary singing over The Game and 50 Cent 's track for `` Hate It Or Love It . '' Cuts like this usually do n't make studio albums and it 's great that this was included because it received a lot of airplay earlier this year . Another rare gem which made the track list is Mary J. Blige and U2 performing the song `` One . `` The Breakthrough is a very soulful and mature Mary J. Blige album . `` I Found My Everything '' featuring Raphael Saadiq is another very rich , soulful song , and Mary once again evokes The Queen of Soul Aretha Franklin , so I think it 's only fitting that Mary J. Blige is known as the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul , because she is this generation 's Queen of Soul .	1
Mary J. Blige - The Breakthrough ( Geffen , 2005 ) Mary J. Blige may call herself `` da MVP '' but two years ago she was anything but . In the midst of the Alicia Keys and Beyonc & eacute ; phenomena ( two women who were inspired by Mary ) , her album , Love & Life , went virtually ignored and the fact that she reunited with Diddy did n't make things any better . However , with all three of those people out of the way , her new husband as manager , and `` Be Without You '' topping the charts , Mary truly broke through with her new album , The Breakthrough.Usually when we buy a Mary album , we say that dreaded phrase : `` It 's not her best but it 's better than her last album . '' We might have to say that again but do not underestimate the songs on here . `` No One Will Do '' starts the album off right while `` Father in You '' and the 9th Wonder-produced `` Good Woman Down '' holds up against all Mary 's other classics . Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis , who were sorely missed since 1999 's Mary , reunite with Blige ( with help from the up-and-coming Avila Brothers ) and brings us the great `` Baggage '' and `` Ca n't Get Enough '' . But one song that trumps even those is the Raphael Saadiq-produced , Aretha-inspired `` I Found My Everything '' . ( Mary and Raphael on the same track ? Why have n't they thought of this before ? ? ) Second place goes to her remake of U2 's `` One '' , featuring U2 themselves , which proves that Mary can work well with almost anybody.I was n't feeling `` Enough Cryin '' or `` Gon na Breakthrough '' , both featuring her rapping alter ego Brook . Also , `` MJB da MVP '' is a mixtape cut that really has no business being on this album . And where 's the other Raphael Saadiq-produced song , `` So Lady '' ? I heard it before but it 's not on this album , at least not on the copy I bought . But there are n't too many bad things you can say for The Breakthrough . Leave it to Mary and/or Geffen Records to drop one of the year 's best R & B ; albums at the end of the year . -EJR	1
Mary J. Blige has been making classic album after classic album fore the past decade and a half and her newest effort is definitely one of her best efforts yet and could arguably be her best cd . Mary J. Blige is undoubtedly the queen of R & B & soul music because no one brings it quite like this . Every song is great and memorable and vocally she sounds amazing rivaling the work done on her debut . The songwriting is of course good and the production is top notch . Every son is so good that it is hard to pick a favorite song but if I had to I 'd say Ca n't Get Enough or I Found My Everything but every song is noteworthy . There 's really nothing else to be said ... this album is simply put , a must have , a classic . Mary J. Blige displays on The Breakthrough why she is so loved . You should already have this album .	1
Sometime in 2005 , it was announced that Mary J. Blige was going to release a greatest hits package . But when the lead single Be Without You hit the airwaves , the impeccable reception led to her seventh studio album being pushed out instead . And what a wise decision this was , as it is easily Mary 's most solid release in the since the turn of the century . Not only does it feature excellent work by some of the biggest producers in the game right now ( Bryan Michael-Cox , Sean Garrett , Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis , to name a few ) but the majority of the tracks also feature writing credits by Mary herself , giving most of the songs the personal touch needed to give them a sense of believability . `` No One Will Do '' is seen one of two ways : easily an album highlight , or just a boring opening track . Fortunately , I 'm leaning more toward the former as this song captures attention and features an excellent vocal performance . The lyrics are well written and fit perfectly with the beat and delivery . `` Enough Cryin ' '' keeps things going at about the same level of quality . Produced by Darkchild , this is one of the songs that has a fair amount of drama . Mary sings about leaving a relationship because she 's sick of crying over it . The bridge in particular is excellent . This song is also one of two that features Mary 's alter-ego `` Brook-Lynn '' rapping , and she actually sounds pretty good . `` About You '' featuring Will.I.Am is probably one of the least memorable songs on the album , which is a shame because it is not bad in any sense . With that said , it is possibly the weakest track on the album just because it tends not to stand out from the pack.On the other hand `` Be Without You '' is easily a highlight . Somewhat reminiscent of Mariah Carey 's `` We Belong Together '' , this song takes things a step further . It has beautifully written lyrics that are relatively deep , and the vocal performance is simply stunning . Although this album has several highlights , this is one of two songs that are on a level of their own . `` Gon na Breakthrough '' is one of the more upbeat tracks that adds elements of fun to the album to keep things from getting too bogged down with the deeper , more dramatic songs . This is far from the best song on the album , but it is definitely a welcome addition . This is also the second song featuring `` Brook-Lynn '' rapping , and again she sounds pretty good . `` Good Woman Down '' is a great song with a great message . Here , Mary sings about how hard it is to sit back and watch things that happened to her happen to others she loves , and telling us `` you ca n't hold a good woman down . '' `` Take Me As I Am '' brings us back into highlight territory , although this was one that had to grow on me initially . This song has Mary singing in the third person , describing her past and asking us to accept her as she is or not at all . This features one of the best vocal performances on the album . Mary 's voice is subtler than on other tracks , but it suits the beat and lyrics perfectly . `` Baggage '' is a song many can relate to , as it describes not wanting to hurt a new relationship with memories and issues from the past . Here , Mary apologizes to her husband for hurting him and assures him that it is only because of what others have done to her in the past , not because of him . This is probably one of a few songs that borders on being merely average , but the bridge almost entirely saves it . `` Ca n't Hide From Luv '' is possibly the only song I truly do n't like on this album . Mary 's voice sounds strained in most places , and the chipmunk-type noises in the background only hinder things further . I do n't know what Mary was trying to do with her vocals here , but I really hope she does n't try it again . `` MJB the MVP '' is the song I was most worried about , as this type of song generally comes across as arrogant , and serves no real purpose . I was pleasantly surprised by how well this worked , and in fact it was one of the songs that stood out most on first listen . The song has Mary recapping her journey thus far , even going so far as to use lines from previous songs of hers . And strangely enough , it works ( except for 50 Cent 's part , but that 's brief enough that it does n't matter ) . `` Ca n't Get Enough '' is a nice mid-tempo that is a good addition to the album as a whole , but does not really stand out . Mary 's voice sounds great here , and the lyrics are really sweet . However , there are far better songs here , but also some worse ones . `` Ai n't Really Love '' is another album highlight , which contains the excellent message that `` a love that tears you down ai n't really love '' . The song has Mary reflecting on a relationship where her partner was distant . The vocals are subtle but full of emotion , thus elevating the song to highlight status . `` I Found My Everything '' is another sweet song , with a straight-forward message . The breakdowns in particular are what make the song stand out , although it is a great effort as a whole . `` Father In You '' has a darker sound , and describes Mary 's childhood without her father around . It features excellent production , and beautifully emotive vocals . This is another highlight that took a couple of listens to grow on me . `` Alone '' is one of those songs that is excellent when you listen to it , but is unmemorable when you think about the album as a whole . It 's really a shame because this is definitely a highlight , and should easily be a standout . Featured vocals by Dave Young only make the song that much better , as he has a great voice . Hopefully this song will stand out more the more one listens . `` One '' featuring U2 is the second song to be completely on a level of its own . Mary and Bono sound excellent together and this and `` Be Without You '' are easily the two best songs . The backing music is stunning , as are the emotive vocals and excellent lyrics . Lastly , there is the hidden track `` So Lady '' which does n't really help the album at all . It does not fit in with the rest although it is a decent song , and `` One '' would have been a much stronger song to end with.Overall Mark : 4.5/5Coming at a time when many artists were making exceptional comebacks ( Mariah Carey in terms of sales , and Toni Braxton in terms of quality ) , Mary proved that she could easily hold her own . It also disproved what many were starting to believe : that Mary was on her way out . Her previous two albums were decent but not her best work , but this one featured Mary back on top form . We can only hope that Mary continues making albums that meet or exceed the quality of this one , although it will be a difficult feat .	1
I 've had this disc since its release day back in December but honestly was so stuck on my favorite single , BE WITHOUT YOU that I had not listened to it in entirety till within this month ! Whoever decided to release that single 1st should be given a marketing medal because it was the kind of `` knock em out the box '' single that Mary needed to bring full attention to her upcoming release.As a fan I enjoyed her last studio release in 2003 but it was considered a flop by many because her initial single did not really turn into a hit that people expect from MJB then in desperation , three singles were quickly released during the summer months but none really caught fire with the public like BE WITHOUT YOU did/has.This is a very good album from start to finish with more than a few strong single tracks & 2 tracks that I deemed `` filler '' .Other than the aforementioned , BE WITHOUT YOU , my other favorite tracks are : MJB DA MVP - magnificently covers her 14+ years in the industry and chronicles briefly critics ' opinions of each releaseCA N'T HIDE FROM LOVE - I swear she was channeling Aretha Franklin on this one ! ALONE - beautiful duetAI N'T REALLY LOVE - classic MJB joint , loved the string arrangementIn my personal MJB album ranking system , this ranks a strong 5th behind : MY LIFE , MARY , SHARE MY WORLD , WHAT 'S THE 411 but miles ahead of NO MORE DRAMA ! Fans should n't be disappointed in this strong effort from the Queen of Hip Hop/Soul !	1
What we have here is hip-hop soul extrodinare Mary J giving us another dose of her take on heartache and pain and just life . The end result is a classic ... .an unexpected classic that I consider one of her best cd 's to date and also most sucessfull thus far . Mary debuted with sales of over 700K in the first week which is way over any first week sales she has done thus far in her career . This time around she works with different producers like Will.I.am , raaphael saadiq , Jimmy jam and Terry L among others . I think that workign with raaphael brings out the most soulful part of her ... .they should do more together . All these things together is what really makes this album `` The breakthrough '' . Now to the songs ... .whats really good ? ... everything for the most part . So i 'll list my personal favorites ... .which are : *No One will Do - If anyone listens to Neyo 's new cd and pays attention..they actually sample the same song . On neyo 's cd the song is `` It just aint right '' . *About you*Enough Cryin* Gon na Breakthrough - Hot beat*Baggage*Cant Hide from Luv*I found my everything*Alone*OneOverall thats my favorite tracks in a nutshell as well as the tracks I think you should really check for . There is also a bonus track that is pretty good too but im not sure what the name of it is . Any fan of mary should of had this already . NOn-fans who like good R+B/hip-hop Soul music should get this . The Mary this time around is a more mature mary giving you a mix of her best momments in one disc.Get it !	1
What an amazing piece of work . Mary has really put her all into this cd . Her songwriting is remarkable and the production is explosive . No filler here . The tracks are all very distinct from each other and could possibly land Mary many number one singles . My favorite track on this cd is `` I Found My Everything '' . It 's like a cross between a classic Prince sound and Aretha Franklin vocal power . Mary has really hit the mark on this project . You better buy it now ! ! ! !	1
I was never really a Mary J. Blige fan , but this album with its R & B ; melodic bliss and lyrics that both break and mend your heart made me a believer ! Mary 's vocals are amazing and her conviction is undeniably evident throughout the record as she tells her story of survival and finding love.My favorite tracks are : Good Woman Down , Take Me As I Am , No One Will Do , and Be Without You . I epscially love Be Without You . It truly is a lover 's anthem ! If you are in love , you got ta hear this song ! This record definitely broke through to me and I am now a big Mary fan ! Go Diva !	1
I 've been a Mary J Blige fan for years now , and I have n't been moved by one of her albums like this since 1999 's MARY . This is her best album since then . Mary brings the heat on THE BREAKTHROUGH ! On this CD she really sings , instead of the histronics we are used to hearing from her . There 's a nice mix of uptempos , and downtempo ballads . Some of my favorites include `` Be Without You '' , `` No One Will Do '' , `` Father In You '' , `` Alone '' , `` Ai n't Really Love '' , and more . Overall I 'm happy to say Mary is back !	1
Girl , you may not be as talented as Ashanti or Brandy , but I love you cause you always keep it real . This CD is off da chain and is pure gehtto fabulousness . Do your thing , Mary , and shake dem haters off !	1
Ok so by now we all know that i 'm the QUEENS biggest fan . Her music speaks to me in ways it ca n't possibly speak to anyone else . This is one of Mary 's best cds . She delivers such a great and powerful performance on the entire album . If you are a true Mary `` The Queen '' J. Blige you will lovethis album.If you are new to the Quees you will become insitantly a MJB Fanatic !	1
`` The Breakthrough '' is Mary 's 7th album . It 's a brilliant combination of classic Soul and edgy hip hop and very personal lyrics that a whole generation could relate to . It seems like she 's been back with the great Jimmy Jam/Lewis , and Jerkins but even other producers are included . On this album there are also some guest artists such as Bono , Raphael Saadiq and Jay-Z . It definitely seems to be one go one step further then her last . The sound is a mix of Soul and Hip Hop and it will definitely give you some surprises . To me the standout tracks are : `` Be Without You '' , `` Gon na Breakthrough '' , `` No One Will Do '' , `` Take Me As I Am '' , `` MJB Da MVP '' and my absolute favorite : `` Enough Cryin '' The best songs are the emotional ballads that she 's always been excellent on . Old fans should definitely not be disappointed.Overall , very well made , both in the production and the songs included . You 'll get emotion , up tempo , Soul and Hip Hip and even some very nice collaboration . 2-3 songs here have the potential to become short toppers . This is an excellent album . Great job Mary ! A Soul Hip Hop Queen for sure .	1
I have been a Mary J. Blige fan since 1992 when she released `` What 's The 411 '' . On `` What 's The 411 '' Mary J Blige caught my attention because she used hip hop samples mixed with r & b ; to create a sound that I was n't use to . Tracks like `` Love No Limit '' , `` Real Love '' , `` Reminisce '' , `` Changes I 've Been Through '' , basically the whole CD , remained in heavy rotation for awhile . However , when Mary J. Blige released `` My Life '' in 1994 , I knew that I would be a Mary J Blige fan for life . This CD , 'til this day is my favorite CD of all time . At the most difficult time in her life , caught up with bad relationships , drugs and alcohol , Mary was still able to release one of the best r & b ; CDs I have ever heard . In certain songs , you could tell that Mary was crying for help and in others you could tell that she just wanted to give an honest perspective on various events that were going on in her life . Just as `` What 's The 411 '' could be , `` My Life '' could be played from beginning to end . There are n't many people who can release 2 CDs and have them be CDs that could be listened to in their entirety . `` I Never Wan na Live Without You '' is still one of my favorite slow jams of all time . In 1997 , Mary J. Blige released `` Share My World '' and that CD would end up being a new beginning for Mary because she was no longer working with Sean `` Puffy '' Combs on her CDs . However , Mary still kept things going with tracks like `` Everything '' , `` Seven Days '' , `` Love Is All We Need '' w/Nas , `` It 's On '' w/R Kelly and the title track . In 1999 , Mary J Blige pulled a switch on us with `` Mary '' . Mary J Blige turned in the hip hop and r & b ; sound and acted as if she wanted to be an adult contemporary r & b ; artist . She had a lot of ballads and midtempo tracks on this CD and some people were unable to relate to the Mary J Blige on this CD . However , once I heard `` All That I Can Say '' I knew that I would n't have a problem with this CD . `` The Love I Never Had '' is still one of my favorite Mary J Blige ballads and the duet with her former boyfriend K-Ci of Jodeci , `` Not Lookin ' '' , is still a classic in my opinion . In 2001 , Mary returned with `` No More Drama '' . She started the party with the Dr. Dre produced `` Family Affair '' , she was ready for a vacation on the Neptunes ' produced `` Steal Away '' and she definitely proved that she was ready to straighten her life out with the powerful `` No More Drama '' , where Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis sampled the theme song to the soap opera , The Young & The Restless . I also ca n't forget the Missy Elliott produced `` Never Been '' . After declaring that she did n't want anymore drama and even working with Puffy again on the `` No More Drama ( Remix ) '' , Mary decided in 2003 to work with Puffy on another CD , `` Love & Life '' . The CD was energized with the first single , `` Love At First Sight '' with Method Man and also featured other tracks that I enjoyed such as the Dr. Dre produced `` Not Today '' w/Eve , `` Ooh '' which sampled the same beat that ED OG & Da Bulldogs used back in the day on `` I Got To Have It '' , `` Willing & Waiting '' and the powerful slow jam , `` Special Part Of Me '' .Some people may not have enjoyed `` Love & Life '' as much as I have , so in 2005/2006 Mary J Blige is back with `` The Breakthrough '' . Some people also see `` The Breakthrough '' as a comeback CD for Mary J Blige . I ca n't see how that 's possible because every CD that Mary releases can be classified atleast as a quality r & b ; CD . There is no `` Emancipation Of Mimi '' going on here . Mariah made quality CDs and then for some years with `` Rainbow '' , Glitter '' and `` Charmbracelet '' she regressed . Mary J Blige has never regressed.The 1st single from `` The Breakthrough '' is `` Be Without You '' . Mary J Blige shows people that she never lost her groove with a track like this . Bryan Michael Cox and Ron Fair provide Mary with a nice midtempo/slow track and Mary takes care of the rest . `` No One Will Do '' is my favorite midtempo track on this CD as this sounds as if this track is a tribute to her husband , Kendu . If you want to try to capture `` The Breakthrough '' in one track , I would say that the one track is the Rodney `` Darkchild '' Jerkins ' produced `` Enough Cryin ' '' . Just like `` Soldier '' by Destiny 's Child was the unoffcial women 's national anthem of 2005 , `` Enough Cryin ' '' is definitely an early candidate for the unofficial women 's national anthem of 2006 . Mary breaks it down as she declares that she is finally ready to get out of the situation that she is in with this particular man . After all the time of being dumb and in love , she is ready to stand up for herself as a woman and declare enough is enough with lines like `` Do n't wan na play house no more , so dumb to think you gon ' marry me , I got to be out my mind , thinking that I need someone to carry me . '' Brandy might want to pull Rodney 's name out of the Rolodex and work with him again after hearing this track . Although , I am not a Black Eye Peas fan , WillIAm outdoes himself on the feel good track `` About You '' featuring Mary , Will and Nina Simone . Will creates a nice track and even when he raps he stays out of Mary 's way as she wants to talk about how this man has got her going . `` Take Me As I Am '' also ends up being one of my favorite tracks as this midtempo jam allows Mary to talk about the fact that people just need to let her be herself and accept her the way that she is in all ways and all aspects of her life . `` Baggage '' has Mary on another nice uptempo track as Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis are back to produce another track with Mary . Mary talks about why she acts certain ways in a relationship because of all the events that have happened in her past relationships . She also says that she does n't mean to make the one that she is currently with to suffer because of that . Vidal & Dre produce `` Ca n't Hide From Luv '' which features Jay Z . The track would have been even better if Jay Z would have actually laid down a verse on the track , but Mary still makes this a nice feel good uptempo track . `` MJB Da MVP '' has Mary making her own song out of Game and 50 Cent 's `` Hate It Or Love It '' . Mary goes through different events in her career and although I wish that the actual remix of Hate It Or Love It with Mary and Game could have been on here , `` MJB Da MVP '' ends up being a nice substitute . `` Ca n't Get Enough '' sounds like an old achool uptempo song as Mary talks about how much she is enjoying her current situation with her man . `` The Breakthrough '' has a real positive vibe to it for the most part . It seems as if Mary J. Blige has let go of the majority of the demons in her past and that is definitely shown throughout this CD.Anyone that knows Mary 's CDs knows that she is going to have some tight ballads on it . `` Ai n't Really Love '' has Bryan Michael Cox back on the production . Mary sings about a situation that finally has her fed up and explains how she loves him but not enough to compromise her own love of self by wasting time in a one sided relationship . `` I Found My Everything '' is produced by Raphael Saadiq and even has Raphael on some background vocals throughout the track . This song sounds as if it 's something that would have appeared on Tony Toni Tone 's last CD , `` House Of Music '' . Mary has definitely added to her classic list of slow jams with this track . `` Father In You '' has Mary explaining the fact that since she did n't have a father figure in her life as a child , she expects that from her mate . This ends up being another one of Mary J. Blige 's powerful slow jams . At the end of `` The Breakthrough '' Mary J. Blige holds her own with U2 on `` One '' as her CD ends on a good note . There is also a bonus track after `` One '' as well . So do n't think that the CD is over after you hear `` One '' .Overall , Mary J Blige has another classic with `` The Breakthrough '' . Alot of people are saying that this is Mary 's best CD . Everyone is entitled to their own opinion . However , I 'll ask anyone who thinks that to listen to `` My Life '' one more time and that may change your mind . If you are a fan of Mary J. Blige and her CDs then you ca n't afford to miss out on `` The Breakthrough '' . Just as I was telling another amazon reviewer , Tony , Mary J. Blige 's `` The Breakthrough '' , Anthony Hamilton 's `` Ai n't Nobody Worryin ' '' and Jamie Foxx 's `` Unpredictable '' are going to be holding me down for awhile as far as current r & b ; music is concerned.P.S . Music listeners do n't be confused by Brook who raps on two tracks on `` The Breakthrough '' . She is actually Mary J.James ' Top 61 ) Enough Cryin'2 ) No One Will Do3 ) I Found My Everything w/Raphael Saadiq4 ) Take Me As I Am5 ) About You6 ) Ca n't Hide From Luv	1
I have n't enjoyed a Mary J Blige album this much since her 1999 MARY album . This seems to be a really personal album for Mary , but in many of the songs she channels this into making anthems . The first single `` Be Without You '' is instantly catchy , classic R & B ballad . The first 8 tracks of this cd are amazing , notably the opener `` No One Will Do '' , the anthems `` Gon na Breakthrough '' and `` Good Woman Down '' , and `` Enough Cryin '' . On `` Enough Cryin '' and `` Gon na Breakthrough '' , Mary raps . They are hot songs ! I hope `` Enough Cryin '' is a single at some point . The latter part of the disc is much more ballad oriented , with some great ones like `` Father In You '' , `` Ai n't Really Love '' , and `` I Found My Everything '' . Overall a great cd !	1
`` The Breakthrough '' is Mary 's 7th album . She started off with the album , `` What 's the 411 ? `` , in 1992 . It was a brilliant combination of classic Soul and edgy hip hop and very personal lyrics that a whole generation could relate to . It was hyped to the skies and she was imediatly compared to Aretha Franklin and Chaka Khan . Her next album `` My Life '' would prove experts right , Mary was indeed the real thing and this P. Diddy produced album was almost as good as the debut . It was most of all , more vulnerable and deep . On third album `` Share My World '' she truly showed her potential to the max , This album was also fukl of good producers such as Babyface , Jimmy Jam/Lewis Jerkins and R. Kelly . On 4th album `` Mary '' she want back to just the classic soul and skipped the Hip Hop that her previous albums had been filled with , the album continued to be full of great producers and was also a success . `` No More Drama '' was released in 2001 , it continued the trend with great producers such as Pharell Williams and Jimnmy Jam/Lewis and was her most mainstream album to date . `` Family Affair '' and `` No More Drama '' were both hit sibgles . `` Love and Life '' was quite a dissapointment though , once again P.Diddy was back as the producer but this time around it was n't as good and most of the album had a sound of overproduction with beats and sound effects instead of just releasing a natural album where Mary could shine on her own . Now 2 years later her new album `` Breakthrough '' is released , read on to find out the conclusions.It seems like she 's been back with the great Jimmy Jam/Lewis , and Jerkins but even other producers are included . On this album there 's also some guest artists such as Bono , Raphael Saadiq and Jay-Z . It defenitely seem to be one go one step further then her last . The sound is a mix of Soul and Hip Hop and it will defenitely give you some surprises . The best songs are the emotional ballads , that she 's always been excellent on . Old fans should defenitely not be dissapointed . `` No One Will Do '' is one of the highlight . Is a emotional midtempo that reflects the perfect love , she admits `` I want no one but you '' . `` Enough Cryin '' is also a midtempo with piano backround , about infedelity . `` About You '' is classic soul/hip hop , Wil.I.Am . also feautures on this one . `` Be Without You '' is a highlight , another emotional ballad with piano where she shows heartache . `` Gon na Breakthrough '' grows on me . Another hip hopish song feauring girl rapper Brook . `` Good Woman Down '' is also about heartache and tough relationships I think . `` Take Me as I Am '' a great personal ballad , the title sais it all . `` Baggage '' a decent midtempo , that would look good on any album . `` Ca n't Hide From Luv '' is hop hop and it feaurures `` retired '' rapper Jay-Z . `` MJB Da MVP '' , well this is quite a surprise , it got the same sound as 5O Cent 's `` Hate it or Love it '' and feautures lyrics from him on the hook . This version takes the price . On the hook she sais `` I 'm the soul hip-hop queen and i aint going nowhere , but you already know meHate it or love it '' I hope this one will be single released . `` Ca n't Get Enough '' is a decent old skool soul midtempo . `` Ai n't Really Me '' also a slow jam about bad relationship and infedelity . `` I Found My Everything '' a soulish duet with Raphael Saadiq . `` Father in You '' slow one too , but typical album material . `` Alone '' a duet with Mary and Dave Young . Last song is a cover/duet of U2 'S `` One '' but it also feautures Bono . This version is one of a few times I can admit that a cover was really well made and diffrent . A bonus track called `` So Lady '' between Mary and Saadiq also appeares as track # 17.Overall , very well made , both in the production and the the songs included . You 'll get emotion , uptempo , Soul and Hip Hip and even some very nice collaborations . 2-3 songs here have the potential to becoma shart toppers . Having said that , this is a exellent album that fans should n't be dissapointed with at all . Great job Mary ! . A Soul Hip Hop Queen for sure .	1
I have been waiting and waiting for this CD and it was WELL worth it ! MJB has ALWAYS been the real deal from the beginning when she dropped on the scene in 1992 with What 's The 411 ? She is what all these new young female R & B ; singers hope to someday become . Many have tried and no one has succeeded . Mary always out does herself with every CD she puts out . Her voice his her own ... very unique ! The Breakthrough is an amazing CD from beginning to end . I would have to say it is my favorite next to My Life and Share My World . It blends the perfect amount of her hip street influenced upbeat songs that just screams MJB from the second the song starts to her signature mid-tempo/ballady R & B ; songs that ONLY Mary can do to perfection . With just the right amount of emotion , sadness , joy , desperation , rawness and strength is what makes MJB who and what she is ! The first single : `` Be Without You '' is amazing . A great mid-tempo song that has Mary written all over it . This CD is great all the way through - not one song that I skip through . With a good amount of guests ( but not too many to be overwhelming ) . I hear A LOT of songs with hit potential and that sound VERY radio friendly ! Standout tracks : `` Be Without You '' , `` Gon na Breakthrough '' , `` No One Will Do '' , `` Take Me As I Am '' , `` MJB Da MVP '' and my absolute favorite : `` Enough Cryin '' This CD is great ! A MUST HAVE ! ! ! ! ! ! For anyone who is a Mary J. Blige fan or for anyone who appreciates good R & B ; and Hip/Hop music this one is for you . There is no one above MJB in the game ! ! ! !	1
I do n't think there will ever be a perfect Mary J Blige CD but this one is one of her releases that is close to perfection . Unlike 94 's `` My LIfe '' this cd does not contain the pain and dispair , which I love about `` My Life '' . This CD shows Mary maturing vocally , as an artist , and as a woman . Stand out songs include `` NO ONe Else '' , `` Enough Cryin '' , `` Father In You '' , and the remake of U2 's `` One . '' The latter is a testament to her vocal maturity and the fact that she is confident in herself now . To take on a U2 song is an amazing thing to do especially if you can pull it off . Still not the most gifted vocalist , Blige is here to stay . I must say that I am a big fan of the Queen and Queen Mary deserves the crown ... .	1
I was skeptical about this album upon release due to the inconsistency of the last two albums ( 2001 's No More Drama and 2003 's Love & Life ) . Luckily Mary has redeemed herself with her seventh studio effort , The Breakthrough . I 've given this album five stars because it 's an album I can play all the way through . The production is great and all the songs are great . I 've always been a big fan of Mary and Mary as a songwriter . My favorite songs are : No One Will Do , Enough Cryin , About You , Good Woman Down . Do n't sleep on this album ! I can truly say this is one of the best albums of 2005 ! This is a great way to end the year . Great job Mary ! ! ! !	1
This is such an excellent cd . I know that that is an overused saying , but this is so true . It 's her best work by far . It 's better than any other cd she 's made and she has made many a good cd . This has powerful ballads and cool funky tunes and anyone who is a Mary fan will love it , and anyone who is n't a Mary fan , will be converted I know ! ! The best cuts on here are Enough Cryin , Take Me As I Am and Ca n't Get Enough . But my absolute favourite is Be Without You . It 's amazing . Well let me say as a true fan , I also ca n't get enough and I just pray that my copy wo n't be too badly scratched as I play it over and over and over again .	1
This is the Mary that we all know and love . The diversity in this CD is wonderful and you can see that she has grown up tremendously and is continuing to live a blessed life free of drama and full of love . Much repect to Mary and the new love that she has found !	1
I love Mary living free in personal redemption she 's struggled to achieve , and her music moves me in a way few singers do . I downloaded this CD from Itunes , havent read the liner notes , etc. , so cant comment on the musicians/producers she works with here , but the writing , the musical arrangements and cohesion of the material , and unforgettable singing indicate that Blige is working at the top of her game . Breakthrough 's the kind of deep soul effort I hoped Mary would do . 'Take Me As I Am ' , 'Be Without You ' , her collaboration with U2 on 'One ' , 'Father in You ' , and 'About You ' that magically weaves musical goddess Nina Simone 's take of 'Feelin Good ' and f/Black Eyed Peas ' Will.I.Am are real highlights of an CD that never lets up , breathing peace every step of the way . Blige 's giant musicianship proves her as a vivid creative force & Breakthrough 's a liberating joy from beginning to end .	1
Listening to `` The Breakthrough '' is like overhearing a very personal , heartfelt conversation between good friends , a confession between a penitent and her priest , a child and her parents ... pillow-talk between lovers.Mary J. has always been about laying it on the line , opening up her veins and bleeding into the grooves of her recordings : she is the most personal of singers.Throughout the last few years she has been able to come up with some great recordings despite a mountain of problems : for example `` Share My World '' and its anthemic call to arms to all young women , `` Not Gon Cry '' ... as much a signature song for Blige as was `` Respect '' for Aretha . But never has her voice been this strong , this committed , this glorious : doable on record with all the studio wizards to make corrections ... .but have you heard her singing live on television lately ? Favorite songs here include `` Good Woman Down , '' `` Ca n't Get Enough of You , '' `` Father in You , the gorgeous , melodic `` Alone '' and the surprisingly effective match between Bono and Blige on `` One . `` CD recording as a way of expiating your Sins , ridding yourself of your Demons , making amends for your miss-steps and faults : Mary , We hear you ... and we get it .	1
Mary J. Blige 's THE BREAKTHROUGH is clearly one of Mary 's strongest albums EVER . Mary J. Blige becomes extremely personal on this album , much more so than her 2003 effort LOVE & LIFE . While LOVE & LIFE was a good album ( though some critics called it one of her weaker efforts ) , THE BREAKTHROUGH easily trumps LOVE in almost everyway.First , Mary J. Blige had some slight pitch issues on LOVE & LIFE . Here on THE BREAKTHROUGH , Blige 's voice is much better in tune while still keeping the same raw emotion that she has within her powerhouse vocals . In fact , in a growth that has stemmed since Blige 's debut album and the emotion she showed on the exceptional `` I 'm Going Down '' ( from her second I believe ) , Blige 's vocals have grown more and more emotional with a greater coarseness that provides for a great texture on her recordings . In fact , Blige is one of the few artists that continue to build herself better and better with each substantial recording . Now , with THE BREAKTHROUGH , she has reached the pinnacle.What is particularly fantastic about THE BREAKTHROUGH is the fact that Blige is n't afraid to admit she has her faults or that she has n't lived a perfect life . Most of her songs have blatant titles such as `` Baggage '' or `` Take Me as I Am '' . Even more sweet or real ( however you perceive it ) is her love songs and `` poetry '' that is directed towards her husband music producer Kendu , where she has such songs as the exceptional `` Ca n't Get Enough '' , `` I Found My Everything '' , and arguably , `` Father in You '' . In another exceptional cut , `` Good Woman Down '' , Blige tells the story about her father being abusive to her mother very powerfully . It is themes such as these that make THE BREAKTHROUGH ever more credible.Not only does THE BREAKTHROUGH stand on its own two feet where topics of interest are concerned , the production is among the best for any R & B ; album of 2005 . On The Jay-Z featured `` Ca n't Hide From Love '' , a neat sample is used mixed with a deep bass line , well produced drum programming , keyboards , and of course Blige 's powerful vocals on top of it all . Furthermore , acoustic piano lines are laced throughout the album on tracks such as excellent first single `` Be Without You '' . Furthermore , some of the risks taking with sampling provide yet another vehicle of excellence to this already exceptional affair . `` About You '' brings late jazz diva Nina Simone to the mix with a sample of her most famous song `` Feeling Good '' . To make the use of that sample even greater is how Blige wonderfully harmonizes above Nina 's low register , smoky vocals . Furthermore , the exceptional `` I Found My Everything '' sounds so similar to Aretha Franklin 's legendary recording of `` You Make Me Feel ( Like a Natural Woman ) '' in its overall timbre and soulful feel . In fact , on several occasions , you can clearly hear the influence of Aretha Franklin on Mary J. Blige as Blige very successfully keeps the spirit of soul alive throughout this album.There is no true filler material on this album , which is shocking for an R & B ; album . This will definitely be a Grammy Nominee for 2007 . This is honestly one of the best R & B ; albums of 2005 , period . Well done Mary . 5 stars .	1
To the Mary fans who 've been avid listeners of her music since 1992 's 'What 's The 411 ? ' , this is a release that many will enjoy . For one , it 's much better than her previous effort , 2003 's 'Love & Life ' where Blige preferred to re-unite with Sean `` P. Diddy '' Combs ; that album was proof that earlier collaborations by Blige & Combs were much better , and that for future reference , Blige should never again do an ENTIRE album with Diddy . 'The Breakthrough ' is easily Mary 's best work since her debut album . That soul is back . The songs here show that she 's in a great place in her life , but throughout those songs , she never forgets her fans that are still going through a struggle . Tracks like `` Good Woman Down '' and `` Enough Cryin ' '' proove that Mary still keeps that one priority in mind when making music : her fans . This CD is one that you can enjoy in its entirety.My favorites ... '' No One Will Do '' '' Enough Cryin ' '' '' Be Without You '' '' One '' ( feat . U2 ) '' I Found My Everything '' '' Baggage '' '' Ca n't Hide From Luv '' ( feat . Jay-Z ) '' Alone '' '' Ai n't Really Love '' '' MJB da MVP '' ( basically , a remix to the Game & 50 Cent 's smash hit , `` Hate It Or Love It '' )	1
Mary J . Blige ! ! ! ! ! ! You know how people say that a particular artist 's music is the soundtrack of their life ... well MJB is that for me . When she sings a song she does n't just sing it . Mary SANNNNGSSS it OK ! She is a true artist and her lastest CD is just plain GOOD ! ! ! ! ! ! So this is a definite recommedation from me .	1
I been a Mary fan from the beginnin ' and this is one of her best cd 's it will rank up there with `` My Life '' and `` What 's the 411 '' and `` Mary '' a true classic . Mary should be winning a lot of awards in `` 06 '' with `` The Breakthrough '' all tracks are done in Mary 's style and sass . What 's left to say , but Mary J. Blige you did a superb job with `` The Breakthrough '' . No one can touch the Queen of Hip Hop Soul UR Supreme !	1
I love this album . I hd n't heard `` Be Without You '' on the radio so i checked it out and love it . i also think `` One '' is a very good Maryized version with Bono kicking it off and handing the baton to Mary to which she brings the song to the Church ! Go head Mary ! ! I also love MJB da MVP in which she sings through her long career and even sings lines from her songs which are favs of mine . I will be listening to this for the next week and may add more . Later	1
Believe it when it 's said repeatedly Mary J. Blige has had her share of heartbreaks . But like all good things she keeps holding on , and here my girl is with # 7 , The Breakthrough.Mary has it all , love , heartbreak and transitions . Of course being involved in love is so much better , and Mary 's love is so transparent in this entire project ! Love is good , and I agree . It 's as if I thought it and she sang it . I do n't mean just one phase she has you in every stage of your life . MJB is a force to be reckoned with , and has always been a MVP amongst my CD collection .	1
Mary is back and telling a story thru music like no one else can tell a story.Sistas when Queen Mary speaks do n't we listen ? What ? Mary still reigns supreme .	1
Mary Did her thing on this album ... I was sleepin on it at first ! I bought it and only listed to MJB , Be without you , and Alone . Then I actually sat down and listened ... .MARY blew them away on this CD None of the imitators can even come close ... .I am so happy to see her come out # 1 Hopefully she will continue to make great music .	1
After the relative disappointment of her last release , the platinum certified # 1 ` Love & life ' ( sales just under a million in the US ) Mary J Blige came back firing from all cylinders on her latest release , ` The breakthrough ' which so far has lived up to it 's name , debuting atop the billboard charts with sales of over 700,000 in the first week of release.This , along with 1999 's ` Mary ' are my favourite of her albums , a tough choice really as every one of her albums is brilliant , including ` Love & life ' . This has got to be the very best R & B ; release of the year.Lead off single has got to be the very best R & B ; song of the year , or the past few years for that matter . A stunning mid tempo ode to love , in the mould of her 1997 hit ` Everything ' , featuring delicate piano , lovely backing vocals , and her fiery vocals.Opening track is the hip hop/soul of ` No one will do ' , a lovely midtempo breezy horn laden number . The piano sprinkled Darkchild produced ` Enough cryin '' is a fiery riposte at players who lead girls on and leave them high and dry , and her telling him she 's through with him and his games.The hip hop laced ` About you ' features Will.I.Am of the Black Eyed Peas and the haunting vocals of Nina Simone ( yes ! ) courtesy of a sample of Simone 's 'Feeling good ' . ` Good woman down ' attests to the strength of woman , even when oppressed by menfolk. ` Take me as I am ' is a stirring lush midtempo number . The lilting midtempo ` MJB da MVP ' chronicles the different stages of her career and has her dropping names of her hits . It also features a rap from 50 Cent . A highlight on this disc. ` Father in you ' is a moving ballad that laments the lack of a father figure in her life , and her plea for her man to be that to her . Brilliant ! ` Alone ' is a brilliant retro sounding duet with Dave Young that would make Marvin Gaye proud.Her stirring remake of U2 's ` One ' starts off similar to the original , with Bono even providing vocals on the first verse , then Mary taking it from there . Her phrasing is different and builds to a crescendo towards the end . Bono and Mary have recorded together before , on Kirk Franklin 's 1998 Grammy nominated 'Lean on me'. ` So lady ' is a neo soul style number similar to UK duo Floetry 's style , and featuring lyrics about how her man makes her feel so much like a lady ( she now wears make up and high heels because of him ) . This is a bonus track on the UK edition , as is the last track , the funky guitar driven ` Show love ' featuring fiery vocals.One of the best releases ( of any musical genre ) of 2005 ! And did I mention how stunning she looks in the sleeve photos ? ?	1
When it comes to putting down naked emotion to music , ( which after all , is what soul music is supposed to be all about ) , there can be no doubt that Mary J. is the best we have right now . There 's also something to be said for the fact that she 's managed to attain and sustain her success without resorting to stripping down to her bikini.I have immense respect for the woman on so many levels . I think it 's clear that over the years , she has grown not only as a recording artiste but also as a person . She 's obviously happier than she 's ever been and this comes through on this latest work . All in all , ( especially when compared to what else is available out there ) , it 's a decent body of work . I 'm not going to bother with individual songs as I think other reviwers on here have said all that needs to be said . What I will say is that after the relative dullness of her last few CDs , Mary J. Blige can rest assured that her crown is safely back in place . The queen of hip-hop/soul/r & b ; is back ! However , it 's my opinion that reviewers who suggest that this is her best work to date , or that it can be compared to `` What 's The 411 ? '' or `` My Life '' just could n't possibly have been there at the time . Those two albums in particular , were events . The songs , the videos , the Puff Daddy club remixes , the drama ... it was a phenomenon the likes of which we are never likely to see again . Mary J. Blige may well go on to produce a CD that will outsell her first two albums - maybe she already has done - but I sincerely doubt that she ( or any other artiste for that matter ) , will be able to replicate the impact that she had when she burst onto the scene in the mid-nineties . My friends and I still feel something today when we play her early stuff and we 're talking well over 10 years later . Will or can the same happen with this one ? I guess we 'll just have to wait and see.With all that said , I still think `` The Breakthrough '' will be a must-have for most ( if not all ) Mary J. fans and it will definitely introduce her to new a brand new and wider audience as well . Good stuff ! Well done , girl ! !	1
After a pretty boring Grammy 's telecast the by-far-the-best performance of the night had to be the collaboration of Mary J. Blige with U2 . Perhaps the best band in the world joined the best voice in R+B on my absolute favorite U2 song . The song has such deep meaning that is not only emphasized by Mary 's powerful vocals , but given a whole new range of emotions upon listening . Fantastic ! Made me purchase the album the next day and is by far her best since her debut album , `` What 's the 411 ? '' A must-have .	1
The Breakthrough is possibly the best album of Mary J. Blige 's great career . Ms. Blige 's singing has gained a sense of maturity and she inhabits the songs with feel of someone who has experienced life 's ups and downs and is comfortable singing about both . Several of the songs are directed at her new husband , producer Kendu Isaacs . The best is `` Baggage '' where she apologizes for bringing all her emotional drama to the relationship and `` Father In You '' is superb classic soul where Ms. Blige thanks her husband for the ways he has made up for her absent father . `` Good Woman Down '' she plays the role of mentor to young woman who went through the troubles she went through . `` I Found My Everything '' is a straight-up anthem with an exuberant vocal . There are virtually no missteps outside of her cover of U2 's `` One '' which drags on a bit too long .	1
I will forever hold `` What 's The 411 ? '' as the ultimate Mary album . `` The Breakthrough '' is a return to MJB 's glory ( not that she ever stopped being glorious ) . This is a definite classic and the first MJB cd I 've heard since 411 where I do n't want to skip one track.Top pics : Enough CryinBe Without YouGood Woman DownTake Me As I AmBaggageMJB Da MVPAi n't Really LoveFather In YouAloneOne	1
Mary J. Blige just is wonderful on `` The Breakthrough '' ! I have played several songs more than once the past 2 days ! Part of her wants to have a good time on the funky songs such as No One Will Do , Enough Cryin ' , MJB da MVP ( which I 've loved since April/May -- sounds like it has live musicians on it instead of several samples thrown together ) , Ca n't Hide from Luv and others . The other part shows her giving advice to her female fans to leave their abusive man in Good Woman Down and Take Me as I Am . The most heartfelt is Father In You , as Mary sees her current husband as her father figure instead of her own father . This has that feel of one of Aretha Franklin 's late '70s ballad hits -- just has that Aretha-esque vibe to it . Note -- Some songs will have you crying , especially Father and Good Woman Down -- the pain is so deeply felt from Mary 's voice . Mary can sure be singing it -- her soulful singing is so good over the hardest hitting beats and rhythms on it . I was going , `` Sing it , girl ! or Sing it Mary ! '' on several of the best songs . I love the orchestra on the Raphael Saadiq assisted I Found My Everything . From his band Toni ! Toni ! Tone ! to this -- man , I do n't know how this guy does it with coming up with these wonderful soul/R & B songs for others ! Take Me As I Am uses the same sample Jay-Z used on his own hit from '96 , Dead Presidents , but a little slower and stark groove . One other surprise is her with U2 doing an update of their '91 song , One . The band sounds fabulous with Mary and Mary and Bono sound so good together . But the band lets Mary do most of the singing here . How smart for U2 to take some time off their hugely successful world tour this year to record a song with Mary J for this album . This album has a lot of producers , almost 20 ( ! ) as well as songwriters . But this is such a dynamic and soulful effort with that extensive a list of musicians and people performing on it .	1
Mary 's Breathough CD explains how she has worked through some things and is building on the positive in her life . You can feel it all through the cd . This cd has versatility , not the same ol woman scorn cry . My favorites are Be Without , Enough Cryin , Take Me as I am and Good Woman Down . Even though the above are my favorite it is hard for me to skip past any song while I am lsitening , so that should say something for a cd these days.I recommend that you support this cd.One Love ! Queen Peace	1
This is actually the second Mary J Blige project I have reviewed . The first one was for `` Share My World '' a project that COMPLETELY changed my mind about Ms Blige . That particular proejct was a milestone - The Breakthrough ranks right up there with Mary 's absolute best.I have become so proud of her persona and how she has literally blossomed . While there were projects between the two mentioned above that were less than stellar , Mary definitely exudes maturity and enrichment in her delivery and her attitude . Moreover , the woman is doing as much as she can to convey that to youung women and for that I applaud her ! ! The Breakthrough , as far as I am concerned , only has ONE cut that I may have rethought - the duo with Bono is so-so but because the rest of the project is positively phenomenal , you can forgive/overlook an indulgence.This is hip-hop for grown folks . Mary looks good - Mary sounds fabulous - Mary is saaaaaaaaangin ' ... ..I highly recommend without qualification this project . It is well produced and showcases the talents of a woman who is a classic example of growth , maturity , and real talent.Yeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssss , Mary ! ! ! !	1
If there is justice in the universe , Mary J 's latest release will definitely introduce her to a much larger audience and bring her a truckload of awards , along with multi-platinum sales . There is , no doubt , that the singer poured all of her considerable vocal and songwriting talents into this most personally revealing and musically satisfying album . Co-writing no less than eleven of the listed sixteen songs ( there is a `` hidden '' bonus cut included at the end of track 16 ) , Blige is a spokesperson for women , as well as a `` therapist '' that can give good counsel to men as they deal the topsy-turvy relations game.On an album wherein all the cuts are outstanding , my favorites include `` Enough Cryin ' '' , a triumph of writing , Blige 's trademark forceful vocal performance , brilliant orchestral arrangement , and extraordinary background accompaniment ; `` About You , '' featuring Will.i.am and legendary Nina Simone , is another brilliantly orchestrated track ; the poetic `` Be Without You '' ; `` Good Woman , '' a thought-provoking and toe-tapping message to the young sistahs ; and the double-threat of `` Take Me as I Am '' and `` Baggage '' . `` MJB Da MVP '' chronicles Blige 's triumphant fourteen-year ( and counting ) career , expressing the singer 's highs and lows , as well as her appreciation of her fans.There are not enough superlatives that can be heaped upon `` Ai n't Really Love . '' This is the kind of song that Aretha could 've done in her prime and , obviously , the `` Queen 's '' scepter has been passed to Mary.The gospel-influenced `` I Found My Everything , '' co-written by featured vocalist Raphael Saadig , has a Prince-thing about it , musically and lyrically . `` Father in You '' is sheer perfection in more ways than one as a tribute to fathers and strong men.And the last ( credited ) cut with U2 ( `` One '' ) demonstrates that Blige can hold her own ( and on occasion , overpower ) the best on the world 's musical stage.Another bonus of the release is the breathtaking photography and attire of the singer.Blige has never looked sexier and more captivating.Mariah Carey best be glad that this album was not released earlier in the year.Mary J 's `` emancipation '' is far superior to `` Mimi 's '' !	1
I love the music of Mary J. Blige . My favorite track on this album is Take Me As I Am . This is an excellent song about self acceptance and loving yourself . This is a very inspirational song for anyone who is struggling in life . No One Will Do is a standout track . This is a song about the love Mary has for her husband . Another highlight on this CD is MJB Da MVP . This song is about the ups and downs of Mary 's life and career in the music business . It is a great dance track . Be Without You is another gem on this album . This is a heart wrenching hit song about missing a loved one . One is a very strong track too . Bono and Mary sound great singing together . Mary gives this classic U2 song a special touch with her soulful voice . The songs on this CD are very personal . The Breakthrough is the best album in the career of Mary J. Blige .	1
In a strong year for the female R & B game which has been nothing short of memorable and incredible , there was just something and someone who was missing to top it all off at the very least . All the great additions and great breakthroughs/comebacks have been something to see , but still there was that one lady who needed to finish it . Well December 20th brought it , a day that you are glad to be alive for with Biggie dropping a classic album after his death , Four Brothers-one of the best movies of the year- coming out on DVD , and Mary J. Blige dropping another standard setting album . The Breakthrough shoots right up to the top , right there with Mariah 's Emancipation . The soul and passion of this woman and the trials that you can tell she 's been through is unmatched . It really shows in the music on this album . You ca n't really find a bad track on the whole cut , although it slightly slows down a tad in quality after the first ten tracks to me ( to ME , might be different for you ) . The album starts off great with No One Will Do , stating that she has come across someone that surpass every other man she 's been involved with ( beat is kind of off-kilterish throwback soul sample ) . Very nice ! Enough Cryin ' and About You are collaborations with a couple of rappers . Enough Cryin ' is an uptempo hip hop track that features a pretty good female rapper called Brook and About You has Will.I.Am who even though Black Eyed Peas done went more crossover pop than anything is still a good rapper that 's on a track that discusses revealing true feelings about the person being involved with . Be Without You , no need for too much on that . A great single to show off the album that has really started to burn up the radio ! Gon na Breakthrough is one of my favorite cuts on the album . An uplifting feel to it that makes you just want to dance your day away . She could be talking about just dropping your stress away or breaking through to a special person and taking them to levels of love they 've never seen . Either way , it 's a lovely track ! Good Woman Down is a track that shows how far Mary has come . Going through so much , she is now at a point where she can teach these young ladies today how not to make the same mistakes or go through the same misfortunes she has . She is a teacher now through the trials and tribulations of love . I like the little background deep sigh of relief on it too . Take Me As I Am is talking about whoever she comes across to take her as is because the things she has gone through has made her , good or bad . So it would not be right to try to make them another person . You either want her like that or you do n't really want her ( a track a lot of people could really take something from or relate to ) . Baggage is another favorite of mine . The beat is a standout . If you ca n't bob your head to it or tap your feet , then I do n't know about you . And the words , on point ! Ties to the previous track in that she has been through a lot , so she carries a lot of hurt and lessons from previous relationships that she may unintentionally hurt her current one . But at the same time , she says there is no denying her love . It 's just she 's confused . Wow ! Ca n't Hide From Luv is another favorite ! It 's a throwback soulful jam ( faster pace track ) . Jay-Z makes a cameo on it , although I wish he could have put a verse down . It would have made it even better . But it is still tight ! MJB Da MVP was put out earlier this year in the spring . It is a sort of remix off of Hate It or Love It . I loved it then and I love it now even though again I wish they would have put the version of her and The Game on it . Ca n't Get Enough , Ai n't Really Love ( about not being love if you are trying to bring a person down , words really hit home with some people I see ) , and I Found My Everything are really good songs as well . ( Side note : Add Ca n't Get Enough to that string/run of great tracks . It was a good track when I first heard it , but now I really love it after hearing it a few more times . Ai n't Really Love as well . ) Father In You is a track about men being a sort of father figure in there ladies ' lives , whether they had one or not but more so if they did n't have one cause they need that comfort and sense of security . Alone is a collabo with someone called Dave Young in talking about not being able to do the relationship alone and both parties having to work at it , which ties into the nice finish-up with a track with U2 called One in both parties becoming one as in tying together to be one ( one heartbeat ) . How ironic in that her and U2 tied together to make this great song in both of them being kind of different genres of music . I really ca n't find anything wrong with this CD . The criticism I would have is that Jay-Z and Game could have made their appearances , the little dip in tracks 11-13 ( Side note : Again , that was my opinion first , not now ) , and it might be a little slow for some other people ( Hip Hop Soul , people ! ) . But criticism might be stretching it . The production and sound were excellent ! Her voice shows again why she is one of the greats of all-time R & B . The Breakthrough is truly an outstanding CD that Mary has put together . Possibly could be her best one in years ! This puts a wrap on the year of 2005 , the best and most prosperous year for the female R & B industry . From Destiny 's Child to Mariah , Keyshia to Fantasia , Amerie to Brooke , Faith , and now Mary J . Go out and cop this album ! You will only do yourself a disservice if you do n't ! Nothing short of great and may only get better as time rolls on . Mariah , move over some and make room for Mary J. at the top ( solo at least ) ! All hail to the queen ! Big ups and thanks Mary for coming with this effort !	1
Long before every R & B ; artist was infusing hip-hop elements into their songs , there was Mary J. Blige who created a new genre onto itself . But unlike her imitators , Blige has something they do n't , soul . While they relay too heavily on the hip-hop the reason Blige has stayed on top is that she finds the right balance between that and soul . Mix that all together with the heartbreak that seem to seep into most of her songs and you have a recipe that 's worthy of a first ballot into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.Even though Blige declared No More Drama on her last album , luckily for us the listener , there is still enough to fill her latest album , The Breakthrough . The drama of finding , and keeping , a good man are at the center of Enough Cryin ' , Baggage and Father in You . And the music does n't faulter when she migrates into more traditional love songs such as No One Will Do , About You , and Ca n't Get Enough.Very rarely does the hip-hop beats drag down the album except on the bongos on Ai n't Really Love overpower the song . But Mary does sample both old school and new school tracks . As for new school , Mary builds MJB da MVP around 50 Cent 's chorus from Hate it or Love It . Then on Gon na Breakthrough Blige sings overtop KRS-One 's Step Into a World ( Rapture 's Delight ) .Then instead of settling for sampling , or even bringing in studio musicians , she gets U2 to make an appearance on the cover of their classic One from Achtung Baby . They even brought along a choir which helps convert the song into a gospel song much like they did on I Have n't Found What I 'm Looking for on Rattle and Hum . Mary even outshines Bono , who trade verses , and hits the line `` Love is a temple , love is a higher law '' like she finally found what she 's looking for . That passion carries over to her new song like Be Without You and I Found My Everything , a duet with Raphael Saadiq of Tony Toni Tone fame .	1
... Where is Mary 's duet with Jamie Foxx titled 'Love Changes ' ? ? ? How About 'Do n't Worry ' , featuring The Game ? ? These 2 songs would make 'The Breakthrough ' even better , so I urge Mary 's fans to remove that crappy track with U2 ( 'One ' ) , and add these 2 songs to this CD for a BETTER BREAKTHROUGH . 'Love Changes ' flows perfectly after 'Ai n't Really Love ' , and 'Do n't Worry ' is a great as a bonus track following 'So Lady ' . I also added Mary 's live remake of Earth Wind & Fire 's 'Ca n't Hide Love ' at the end of the CD.As for Mary , I am impressed with the improvement of her vocals , and after 13 years , she 's still bringing IT with so much passion . IMO , 'The Breakthrough ' is a much needed improvement over the Puff Daddy reunion 'Love & Life ' ( Whew..Hot Mess ! ) , and it may eventually be mentioned as a Mary classic ala 'My Life ' & 'Mary ' . Serious fans are urged to also visit Target & get their exclusive Mary CD ( 'My Collection Of Love Songs..Live ' ) .Good Job Mary & Welcome Back !	1
ummmm ... .o.k . I 'm not really one to get caught up in the hype of the `` latest record '' and with an artist as big as Mary dropping a new release , that is exactly what i was expecting ... a couple of decent songs but mostly hype . Plus I 've been burned so much recently ... But this c.d . really is CRAZY . The production is simply SICK ... .amazing job from the producers . Ca n't even pick favorites yet b/c I just started listening ... but for real , cop this one	1
There is no other way for me to describe Mary except to say she is amazing . Mary paved the way for the other R & B ; artist to infuse hip hop into their work , but Mary has this way of doing it that is simply effortless . It 's a perfect blend of the two genres , without the Hip Hop being overpowering . Mary has this way to put songs on her CD that really hit home , and it let 's you know , `` I know what you are going through , I 've been there ! ! `` With The Breakthrough , Mary has shown she has matured , personally and vocally , she is happy , she is in love , but she still has some of those `` I 'm healing '' type of songs as well that can be inspirational to other women . She has truly grown as a person , and it 's clearly reflected in the songs on the CD.Enough Crying - This song is my anthem ! ! ! I hear you Mary , Enough Crying ! ! ! Mary doing her own rapping was a nice touch. Gon na Breakthrough- This is a song you can listen to when you are having a tough time and know , things will be okay again . We all will have that Breakthough in our life.Good Woman Down- I think a lot of women will appreciate this song . It 's inspirational , and touching.Take me as I am- the song says it all . I am the person I 'm meant to be , take it or leave it.MJB Da MVP- Okay honestly did not like this song at first , but it grew on me . Mary pretty much letting it be known , she has the crown on lock.Ai n't Really Love- this song is one I know plenty of women should listen to . We all had that man we really loved , but did not love us back . I simply love this song ! ! Father in You - this is a nice and touching song.Alone - When I first heard this song , I thought the singer was Dave Hollister . This track is really nice.One - I love this tract . It 's really nice , and Mary Sings the heck out of her verse.The Bonus track after One is my song ! ! The beat is hype , and I work out to that song frequently . This is an excellent CD from Mary , and it gets heavy play in my CD in the car . Bravo Mary , Bravo ! ! ! I 'm happy she has found love , and she has found some peace in her life . Keep doing your thing Mary ! ! !	1
I only gave this album 4 stars b/c I personally do n't believe in perfection . I 'm an amazon user who knows how many of these listed albums get over-hyped with glowing reviews ( i.e . Britney Spears , Ashanti , well , really most of commercial music out these days ) .But this album deserves all the good reviews posted by the true Mary fans that copped this LP today . Vocally , I think this is Mary 's BEST album by far . I could only listen to 3/4ths of it over lunch today , but was lovin ' it all . The track with Will.i.am could 've stood alone without him.This is a destined classic in the vein of `` What 's the 4-1-1 , '' `` My Life '' and `` Mary . '' It 's definitely an album that 'll bring new Mary fans onto the bandwagon & cement her place as the Queen of Hip Hop Soul . There 's only one ! Instant classic is the Mary joint with Raphael Saadiq , `` I found my everything '' ... I thought I was in church ! Trust . Vocally , this album should give Whitney Houston hope she can get herself together and get all the way back if she wants . ( I love me some Mary 2 death , but I NEVER thought I 'd make this last statement -- This LP is that good ! ) .	1
This is the first Mary J Blige CD I 've bought in more than 5 years , and boy am I glad I did . It 's been playing , every song , straight through , since I got it 3 months ago . And really , is n't that the true test of a good CD ? You want to hear it all the time ?	1
This CD is excellent and shows why Mary J can never become a has been . Mary has been through it all , we 've seen all these young girls come out and fade away and yet still Mary has the ability to stay on top.The CD shows how she 's matured , how she 's in love and how she 's overcome all of the negativity in her life.Definitely worth the money .	1
Are we surprised ? ? ? ? NEVER . Mary J Blige is without a shadow of doubt , the best R & P HipHop Soul female artist of our generation . Of course , there are those that came before him ... Patti , Aretha , Sheryl ... . need I go down the list ? ? ? But For our generation ( I 'm 24 ) It 's all MJB . She has it on lock . Mary J has a secure set of fans and I would have to say of all artists , she should feel most secure . But as we all know , Mary is very humble and that 's why we love her ! ! ! All of the songs are hot , BE WITHOUT YOU is the JAM . I am so glad she put out a HAPPY love song ! One that embraces love , I 'm at the same point in my life so I 'm really feeling that one ! But overall , she 's never a disappointment ... she 's always been giving us quality , sincere , realistic music that fits into our lives so perfectly ... she 's totally relateable.. she 's the girl next door.. she 's just REAL.. I love this woman , and I wish her so so so so very much success in life ... she is one of the few artists that are just as appreciative as they are worthy of all the love , support , and praise they receive . I am HAPPY to spend money to support Mary J because she always , ALWAYS gives us so much quality in the product . WE LOVE YOU MARY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
This album is awesome and it 's nice to have it on vinyl ! ! ! Who would have though the BIG disc would make a comeback ! ! ! I had to add this awesome album to my collection ! Thanks seller !	1
Mary J. Blige does n't pick her album titles by accident . `` No More Drama , '' `` Share My World , '' and `` My Life '' reveal a chapter of the stormy life of Ms. Blige , who had to endure a string of adversities including drug use , soured relationships , and abuse . But if the title of her 2005 album is any indication , she 's come even closer to the inner peace that seems to have eluded her for much of her 35 years . On `` The Breakthrough , '' the Queen of Hip Hop Soul delivers a reliably strong mix of r & b : some of it gritty , some of it polished , but all of it is good . The kickoff single `` Be Without You '' is a well-deserved radio hit , and other notables are `` Baggage '' and the achingly beautiful `` Father in You . '' The head-turner has to be her duet with U2 . Together , they cover the band 's 1991 ballad `` One , '' and Blige 's smoky delivery reveals a newfound soulfulness that even Bono ca n't match . `` The Breakthrough '' is already Blige 's biggest-selling album in years , following her much-ballyhooed reunion with P.Diddy on her last disc `` Love and Life . '' 14 years since her debut , Mary J. shows no sign of slowing down , and this latest disc shows that she still has a long career ahead of her .	1
In a realm where beauty sells albums , greatest hits collections are collated after a mere three albums and recording artists are measured on unit quantity rather than unique quality , Mary J Blige stands as a strong and dignified contrast to the regular industry machinations.Everyone from Alicia Keys to Jennifer Lopez has been influenced by Mary J 's style . Perhaps The Breakthrough , her seventh album and a Billboard chart-topper , will contain a single that can see her elevated to the level of Beyonce . With guests such as Will.I.Am , Jay-Z and U2 , there 's no doubting Mary J Blige has brought out the big guns for her latest album.Rather than the flippant tomfoolery he 's lately shown on Black Eyed Peas ' My Humps , Will.I.Am instead takes a sample of Nina Simone 's Feeling Good for his Mary J Blige collaboration About You . Jay-Z 's contribution to Ca n't Hide From Luv is kept to a minimal appearance on the introduction and even 50 Cent is ushered into a low-key role for MJB Da MVP ( in fact a rewritten and remixed version of the 50 Cent and The Game collaboration Hate It Or Love It ) .Having performed the song live together on stage in 2005 , U2 's appearance on One lets the Irish rock stars toy with the original arrangement of the song while adding Blige 's strong range where Bono 's ragged voice no longer goes . The funky bass and synthesizers of Baggage are reminiscent of past Mary J Blige glories , Take Me As I Am is an autobiography of hardship and Good Woman Down once again finds the gifted soul singer penning tough anti-violence lyrics.An affirmation of her strengths , The Breakthrough proves Blige is still an R & B ; heavyweight . As she notes on MJB Da MVP `` I 'm still glad to be here and my music 's still sincere '' . All bow to Queen Mary .	1
I am a Mary J Blige fan , and have been since I first heard You Remind Me on the radio when I was in 8th grade . I have bought all of her albums on the day they came out , and all of them are on heavy rotation on my iPod . This will be no exception . This is a great one , Miss MJB.I have been listening to The Breakthrough at least 4 times a week in it 's entirety since it dropped . That should tell you a lot right there . I wish I would have reviewed my first listen , because I honestly was n't that impressed . But it grew on me , and now it 's firmly planted in my soul.No One Will Do - The lyrics get kind of cheesy at times , but Mary kills this one . The beat is nice too . 5/5Enough Cryin ' - The second single , and a club banga . The rhyme is ok , but again , the vocals are on point . 4/5About You - I love this song ! The beat , the sample , Will.I.Am 's verse with Mary in the background , everything . 5/5Be Without You - When the CD dropped , this stayed on repeat . I kind of played it out , but it 's still a great song . 4/5Gonna Breakthrough - This is my least favorite song on the CD . Still good for a filler track though . 3/5Good Woman Down - Great message and an uplifting song . Good vocals . 4/5Take Me As I Am - Another great message , and a pretty song at that . 4/5Baggage - Lovely vocals and a nice smooth beat . 4/5Ca n't Hide from Luv - Reading the back of the CD , I was hype that my favorite rapper , Jay-Z , was dropping a verse for Miss MJB . Not . Just a couple of ad libs . But the song is still a hot , uptempo jam . 5/5MJB da MVP - Technically the first single of the album , dropping in early 2005 . A rundown of MJB 's career and life . Nice track . I especially like the melody at the end of all her hits . 4/5Ca n't Get Enough - This is a beautiful song . beautiful vocals , beautiful beat , beautiful lyrics . This is a song by a woman in LOVE ya 'll . 5/5Ai n't Really Love - Finally a classic Mary joint , full of hurt and pain . But guess what ? It 's not relevant anymore . It 's not Mary anymore . But I still like it . 4/5I Found My Everything - Aretha and Prince ? That was my first thought when I heard this track . A classic . 5/5Father In You - A peek into MJB 's soul . A very personal track . 4/5Alone - A nice duet . Nothing exceptional though . 3/5One - My favorite song on the album . Repeat : My favorite song on the album . Mary 's vocals give me chills . 5/5Show Love - Bonus track . Nice club joint . 3/5	1
I must say that in my opinion this CD is absolutely flawless . Her delivery and production works very smoothly . Mary 's voice seems so much more smoother and the lyrics are deeper this time around where as `` Love & Life '' and `` No More Drama '' lyrics were kind of surface and music were too vague . I rushed to get this album ... my favorites are : No One Will DoAi n't Really LoveBe Without YouEnough Cryin'Take Me As I AmFantastic Job Mary ! ! ! !	1
In the strange trip of making this album , Mary J. was this close to not releasing an all-new album this year . By October , word came up of a greatest-hits but that soon was shot down when it was announced that there would indeed be a new album of all new Mary J. tracks and it arrived just in time before the year was over.In the scheme of things , Mary decided not to trust Puff Daddy on this latest , her seventh , in what has been a strange yet beautiful and amazing fourteen-year career , and it was the best decision the Queen ever made because this album is ten times better than `` Love & Life '' was . Not to knock it but it held Mary back , I think . Finally on `` The Breakthrough '' , she let it all out and to good effect.In some of the tracks , she shows why she will always keep hip-hop as a medium for her to express herself , but in others , she brings nothing but straight up soul music and you ca n't do nothing BUT feel it . And then in others is so self-explanatory you just got ta let it groove . Possibly one of the hottest albums to come out in the last bit of the year and entering 2006 on a high , Mary J. answered to those who thought she had totally forsaken her craft of singing her pain in her music . Songs like `` Enough Crying '' , `` Good Woman Down '' , `` Take Me As I Am '' , `` Baggage '' , `` Ai n't Really Love '' , `` Father in You '' and `` Alone '' shows that she can still bring out drama ( no pun ) and emotions like no one else in this day and age.There 's also tracks that 'll make you get off your seat and do the wop ( `` Gon na Breakthrough '' , `` Ca n't Hide From Luv '' , `` MJB Da MVP '' and the hidden song , `` Show Luv '' ) , and there 's songs that 'll make you tell your lover everything ( `` No One Will Do '' , `` About You '' , `` Be Without You '' ) . While she hits on a rare social number with `` One '' featuring U2 , she actually turns the classic 1992 rock ballad by the Ireland boys and makes it a soulful opus . It 's cool Bono let Mary handle the rest of the song . But it 's the soulful Aretha/Natalie/Motown-inspired Raphael Saadiq-produced ballad , `` I Found My Everything '' that proves Mary is what she 's worth in hot buttered soul rather than the cookie cutter R & B ; that 's out now.Overall , Mary J. Blige shows why she remains the queen of modern R & B ; and soul music and those wondering otherwise , do n't worry , you 'll find your way soon enough . Hate it or love it , Mary J. is gon na shine forever and ever .	1
These are 16 terrifically sung tunes , mostly on the theme of , you guessed it , love ... The team-up with U2 is particularly outstanding ( they brought the house down together at the Grammys , in case you missed it ) . An exemplary R & B vocalist and pretty much the closest thing to Aretha going today , apart from the real Aretha her own self ...	1
i did n't love that much `` no more drama '' and `` love & life '' but this one is amazing , her best work since `` share my world '' , maybe her best ever ! Thank you Mary , you make me happy !	1
After a disappointing sixth album , Love & Life , Mary truly had a come back with this album . Not only did it sell almost three million copies to date , 720,000 of those from the first week , but she was also nominated for eight Grammy awards . ( She should 've won them all , but of course the Grammy committee has to give the golden prize to some country group just because they distastefully speak out about politics ) . Anyways ... I love this album . It is one of my favorites . All of the songs are excellent and I can listen to the whole thing straight through . I especially love `` No One Will Do '' , `` Alone '' and `` I Found My Everything . '' Those are some beautiful songs . Mary delivers a beautiful performance on the remake of U2 's `` One . '' ( She actually made me like a U2 song . That in itself is a miracle . ) I highly recommend that you buy this , especially at the great price Amazon offers .	1
Man , Mary has trully made an ample number of soul stirring contributions to the hiphop/soul genre . What is very apparent is that she is constantly growing and becoming more sensitive to the trial & tribulations of life . She has also overcome addition , low-self esteem ( more to come )	1
No-one can accuse Shakira ( real name Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll ) of being a run of the mill Latin pop artiste . Her voice can be picked out from across a room , and those dance moves & # 8211 ; you & # 8217 ; d have to be visually impaired not to notice her.There & # 8217 ; s a reason for her popularity , and in this English language follow up to Fijac & iacute ; on Oral Vol.1 ( June 2005 ) , she proves that she can keep her English-speaking fan base happy too.Dramatically starting off with a choral rendition of a section of & # 8220 ; The Lord & # 8217 ; s Prayer & # 8221 ; , & # 8220 ; How Do You Do & # 8221 ; is definitely one to watch , and first single & # 8220 ; Don & # 8217 ; t Bother & # 8221 ; is about losing a lover to an admittedly better woman in all areas but one. & # 8220 ; I & # 8217 ; m sure she doesn & # 8217 ; t knowHow to touch you like I wouldI beat her at that one goodDon & # 8217 ; t you think so ? & # 8221 ; Chock full of great songs , she follows up the first two songs with & # 8220 ; Illegal & # 8221 ; featuring Carlos Santana , and & # 8220 ; The Day and the Time & # 8221 ; with Gustavo Cerati . & # 8220 ; Animal City & # 8221 ; and & # 8220 ; Dreams for Plans & # 8221 ; are also good , & # 8220 ; Hey You & # 8221 ; is a bundle of retro fun , and then she turns down the pace for & # 8220 ; Your Embrace & # 8221 ; and & # 8220 ; Something & # 8221 ; . Just to make sure you know your rest break is over after the last few songs , she hits you with the dance track & # 8220 ; Timor & # 8221 ; as a grande finale.This is an oral fixation that will have you begging for more.Amanda Richards , November 29 , 2005	1
Oral Fixation Vol . 2 finds Shakira going back to her original pop-rock roots , leaving behind the eclectic mix of Latin , tropical and pop beats on `` Fijacion Oral Vol . 1 '' and radio-friendly `` Laundry Service . '' With her trademark yodel and breathy vocals , this is definitely one of her strongest albums , Spanish or English , to date . The first single `` Do n't Bother '' is definitely not a stand out by any means , and does not define the sound of this album . Like most of Shakira 's efforts , this a album is a seemingly random mix of sounds and moods , and `` Illegal '' with Carlos Santana , is a haunting melody accentuated by Shakira 's strong vocals . The album 's best tracks can be found in `` Animal City '' - a brilliant experiment in pop rock , with Shakira at her eclectic best , and `` Timor '' - a fast paced dance floor filler . English translations of dance tracks from Fijacion Oral Vol . 1 actually improve on the tracks ( somehow ) and `` The Day and the Time '' is one of the most brilliant tracks on this well rounded album.With almost no filler , this is probably Shakira 's best effort since the ground-breaking `` Donde Estan Los Ladrones ? ''	1
Few pop CDs blow me away , pop really has become a bland genre that does n't earn much credit . However , when you browse through the reviews you 'll notice how highly rated Oral Fixation Vol . 2 is . Every good thing said about this CD is true , it 's fantastic . I was a skeptic but was so struck by Do n't Bother that I did decide to get it . A lot of CDs nowadays take a few listens to really start to appreciate what you 're given , but with Oral Fixation Vol . 2 it only takes one listen and you know that you just listened to one of the finest pop albums of the year . Personally , I ca n't find a track I do n't like , each one is exactly what it should be . This is the CD Laundry Service should 've been . I know Shakira fans believe that CD was really good but I thought Shakira 's voice was the only thing that really set it apart from the rest . But with Vol . 2 , Shakira sets a new standard for this genre.How Do You Do is a nice introduction with a hip hop-esque beat in the verses yet changes to rock in the choruses . I have n't seen that done in a lot of music so I 'm a fan of it and that scores points with me . It helps that it 's an insanely catchy song though . Do n't Bother earns it 's spot as the lead single . I do n't really know how to explain the feel of the song but the chorus is very catchy in the sense that you feel like you 've heard it before . Illegal is a lot slower than I expected seeing as how Carlos Santana is featured on guitar . A lot of his songs are upbeat so , naturally , I figured Illegal would follow in the same vein but no , it 's got almost a lounge feel to it . The Day And The Time is another slow song but in no way sounds like Illegal . It does have a catchy little 80s type hook to it so that 's a nice touch . Animal City is destined to become one of the best songs featured . Animal City moves away from the slow ballad-like songs and is a real toe-tapper complete with Spanish horns . The chorus is very original and memorable and will no doubt get stuck in your head . If I were forced to pick a low point on this CD I 'd pick Dreams For Plans , but that 's only if I was forced . It 's got all the ingredients for a wonderful song , but somehow falls short . Even when Shakira is n't at the top of her game she 's still considerably better than any other pop singer though . Hey You is a nice happy go lucky track that deserves a listen . Your Embrace is a gorgeous ballad . It 's basically just a song to a lover , as any ballad is . Costume Makes The Clown picks up the pace in a huge way with extremely spiteful lyrics and nice use of guitars . Costume.. is a personal favorite , though I 'm sure there 's a lot of people who are sure to disagree . Something is another slow song that features good lyrics and lush melodies , so no complaints there . I 'm glad Shakira rounded out this CD with the upbeat Timor . It makes great use of sound effects , 80s-esque beats , and even a choir . There 's no song I could think of that could close this CD better.My favorite songs Oral Fixation Vol . 2 have to offer are How Do You Do , Do n't Bother , Illegal , Animal City , and Costume Makes The Clown . Whether you 're lured in by the sexy cover shot or simply by Shakira 's music , you 're bound to find a few things you like about this CD . If you were let down by past releases of Shakira 's yet saw potential , what you 'll hear on this CD is Shakira grasping that potential and wringing out every possible drop of good music .	1
Latin superstar Shakira gave the other chart hitters a run for their money with her No . 1 international smash '' Hips Do n't Lie , '' considered by many to be the song of the summer . The track is instantly likable and its sexy call-and-response dialogue ( between the famous hip-shaker and islander Wyclef Jean ) sizzles . Oral Fixation is a brilliant release and definitely lives up to the instant smash that `` Hips '' provided Shakira . From the amazing opener `` How Do You Do , '' a haunting questioning of faith song that soars during the chorus , to the dance-oriented `` Animal City '' ( which discusses the downside of fame ) and closing disco single `` Timor , '' tried-and-true rock hit `` Do n't Bother '' and poetic `` Dreams For Plans , '' Oral seduces the listener throughout each of its tracks . Sure , there are some tepid moments here , like the sometimes good-sometimes bad `` Illegal , '' horrific `` Hey You '' and bland `` The Day and the Time , '' but for the most part Shakira soars on record . Her voice is in fine form as well . Though Fijacion Oral might sound more genuine ( since it 's widely agreed Shakira sounds better singing in her native Spanish than in English ) , the English-language Oral Fixation is a much better and thorough album .	1
So , under the pressure of hearing a few songs off this album , I went off and bought it.I was happy with my purchase . Many of the songs I really truly do love , but there are a few clunkers here in my opinion.Shakira keeps her fun , latin-pop sound that she 's always had . Improving on a few aspects , like this album is much more rocky than her previous ones . I was actually quite surprised by some of the songs , like `` Animal City '' . It 's ... .rock . With Shakira ! Awesome ! Some other songs surprised me in different ways , like `` Hey You '' . Blatant in every way . I mean , how many different ways can you take , `` I wan na be the owner of your zipper . '' I mean ... okay Shakira ! Clunkers ? Yes . They are here , and I find them quite bad . `` Illegal '' and `` Dreams for Plans '' . Yes , I know . You have to have a few slow songs on there , but these are just ... .YUCK ! They should have been taken off the CD . I really dislike the songs . That 's why I only give this album 4 stars instead of 5 . The presence of these songs really puts a taint on this album.Otherwise , an awesome album . She lives up to the `` Oral Fixation '' quite nicely .	1
Ok , so I have listened to both albums and I have to say they are both good.The english versions of `` en tus pupilas '' and `` Dia Especial '' are just weird when I hear them I cant help but sing along to them in spanish . But also the bottom fact is that both albums have there fair share of dumb tracksFijacion Oral , Vol 1 : The Dumb Tracks : Escondite InglesLo ImprescindibleOral Fixation , Vol 2 : The dumb tracks : Hey YouTimorI love all the other tracksYeah sure , the new album dosent have the flare that Whenever , wherever made Laundry Service such a big hit but the bottom line is that it is cool . Her songs that are from spanish to english arent very good but they are still worth a listen and good to present to those who havent heard Fijacion Oral Vol 1.Get This album NOW ! and while you do pick up FIJACION ORAL , VOL 1 ! If Laundry Service put you off , dont worry ! This is MUCH better ! Go now ! ! ! '' Your family got bigger when they thought you were rich ''	1
Another strong album from Shakira . I would rate this as slighly less then `` Laundry Service '' but still an enjoyable album worht listening too .	1
from the opening chant of `` Our Father '' through to the reprise of `` La Tortura '' , which was obviously added to boost sales ( as it was the biggest Spanish-language song since Los Lobos ' `` La Bamba '' in 1987 ) , Shakira takes us on a musical journey of many different styles and does a great job.Track by track : How Do You Do - part of it sounds almost too Avril Lavigne/Kelly Clarkson like , but the addition of religious imagery and various languages makes it a good track.Illegal - the made-for-AC-radio ballad includes some fierce guitar playing by Carlos Santana . Very pretty and almost sounds like something from the 1980'sHips Do n't Lie - just added to the album ... Shakira successfully did what the likes of J . Lo and Mariah have always failed to do when collaborated , she made Wyclef Jean assimilate to HER style of music , as opposed to her doing a hip hop number . A Latin-sounding booty-shaking fun track that is climbing the charts.Animal City - one of the two most rocking tracks on the album , Shakira sings about celebrity and the way people change around her and become greedy.The Day And The Time - a beautiful track about hope and redemptionDreams For Plans - meloncholy but beautiful , with just a hint of Portishead trip-hop to the mixHey You - this sounds almost like something No Doubt would do , very fun song that you will tap your toes and sing along to , a potential single IMO.Your Embrace - one of the saddest songs on the record , but another pretty melodic balladCostume Makes The Clown - instead of being the cheated ... Shakira is the unfaithful one and she 's trying to apologize to her boyfriend , a rockerSomething - Shakira sings in French and gives us another ballad , albeit more alternative sounding than the other tracksTimor - this is the dance track , sounds a bit like a Madonna track . Shakira is singing about the oppressed and the government ... even though she 's singing about South America , I think Shakira 's gay fanbase can definately adopt this track because it applies to them too ... definately remix-worthyLa Tortura - this was one of the big hits last summer , added on the reissue to help boost sales ( much like Hips Do n't Lie ) , this is an alternate Spanglish mix with a little English thrown inNot an award-worthy album and not a life-changer , but Shakira 's album is still a very worthy listen and the second wind it 's catching is well worth it and I hope this album holds on well . There 's a little something for everyone , there are a few too many ballads , but the slow songs all work and are some of the best tracks here . Definate thumbs up .	1
Shakira wowed us this year with the release of not one but two cds . Earlier in the year she gave us Fijacion Oral Vol . 1 , featuring the top 40 hit song , `` La Tortura '' . Now she gives us her English offering , Oral Fixation Vol . 2 , with its first single , `` Do n't Bother '' . Shakira is an interesting artist with a great voice and creative lyrics . My favorite songs from this set are `` Do n't Bother '' , `` Animal City '' and `` Timor '' . I really hope that she will release `` Animal City '' as a single from this cd.I discovered Shakira with her hit cd , `` Donde Estan Las Ladrones ? `` , which I still consider her best cd . To me , Shakira is at her best in Spanish , singing more powerfully and passionately . But I 'm glad that English speaking fans are beginning to recognize her talent . If you have n't given her a listen , also check out `` Laundry Service '' and `` Donde Estan Las Ladrones ? '' . She 's definitely a great addition to your cd library .	1
When I got Fijaci & oacute ; n Oral Volumen I , I was n't disappointed necessarily ... I kind of expected that it would n't measure up to her past ones ( DELL and PD ) . Although it was a little too synthesized for my tastes , I did enjoy it , and continue to do so.With Oral Fixation Volume II , I was surprised by a couple songs . I expected that this CD , too , would be a little more pop or polished than I wanted , but having that in mind I think I came out satisfied.I absolutely love the first song , `` How Do You Do . '' Personally , I 've grown up in a very conservative religious family and it 's been hard for me because I 'm not that way by nature , and so the friction that is there has caused some problems in my life and I 'm trying to breakaway from it a bit . This song is WONDERFUL in regards to that because it deals with religion , more specifically the idea of God . Often it seems to many that God is just this mysterious figure that 's in control of everything and does n't really care ... this song is written from a questioning point of view , almost as a challenge of sorts . It deals with questions like `` If God is so good , why is there pain and suffering , '' etc . It makes you think and also services to maybe burn some of the frustrated energy off you have concerning the topic of religion and God.I really enjoy `` Animal City '' because it 's got a very exotic feel to it mixed with some great lyrics to back it up . I think in this song Shakira is kind of trying to dispense some type of nostalgic wisdom thru a bit of playful cynicism . I love the line `` 'Cause it 's an animal city , it 's a cannibal world , so be obedient , do n't argue '' She 's extending a warning in order to spare someone some pain while at the same time being a little bit sarcastic and dark . `` Dreams For Plans , '' simply put , is a song about real love . Not just skipping thru a flowery field love or GOD this world sucks love , just real . Seeing that things change over the months and years and you can either abandon it or work on it and upkeep it . `` Timor '' is a wonderful song lyrically ! I love how she 's pointing a light on American democracy and what a joke it is in some ways . This song is very political and very idealistic , which is what I LOVE about Shakira , it harkens back to her old says on Pies Descalzos and Donde Estan Los Ladrones.Overall I 'd say that the reason I 'm most impressed by this album is the lyrics rather than the sound . There are the token cliche songs and the remakes of songs from Fijaci & oacute ; n Oral Volumen I that I do n't really like ( except `` Something '' is ok ) . So I 'd say go for it , do n't set your hopes too high , but do n't write it off as ( complete ) crap either !	1
Of course the big difference between Volume 1 and Volume 2 is that Volume 1 was all sung in Spanish ; Volume 2 is in English.Too often artists release a volume 2 that is just more of the same stuff as volume 1 and not generally as good . Volume 2 is completely different than Volume 1 and is enjoyable . In my mind , no particular song stands out , but it 's all easy to listen to . Shakira seems to do her best in her native tongue ( Spanish ) and her English singing does seem slightly more strained ; not quite as natural sounding as the Spanish . Still she does a more than admirable job in English and this album is better than 90 % of the stuff out there . There are n't a lot of artists who can be a success in music in two languages , so it is is noteworthy that she can pull it off . It 's also somewhat amazing that non-Spanish speakers enjoy her Spanish only albums a great deal , even though they may not understand a word of what she is singing . I do n't think she is any flash in the pan and may have some lasting power , depending on where she goes from here . Her gorgeous face does n't hurt either , but you can enjoy her albums a lot without seeing what she looks like . That 's not true of some artists who look great on video , but do n't hold up as well on recordings . I have n't yet seen her on video , so I am looking forward to it .	1
If you like Shakira 's music , then you 'll love this cd . It came in tact and on time , and i enjoy it in my car from time to time .	1
wow , she blew me away with this album . i thought it would be good . but this was a very pleasant surprise . i 've been listening to it all day . lots of great songs . both ballads and uptempo . this , in my opinion is way better than laundry service . my faves are `` timor '' , `` dont bother '' , `` illegal '' `` how do you do '' `` dreams for plans '' ( that one made me cry ) . really they 're all excellent . `` timor '' is the catchiest of the bunch . very 80 's sounding . and great use of a childrens choir in the chorus . very addictive.i can see the video already .	1
After years in the Spanish-speaking market Shakira emerged in 2001 with her infectious single Whenever , Wherever which she followed up with her phenomenally successfull album Laundry Service . Shakira had an unique formula : great voice , sexually suggestive dance moves , a successfull recording career in another language and she was a blonde latino girl . This formula helped her sell 13 million copies of Laundry Service and become one of the breakthrough acts of 2001.Then in 2005 , she returned with two albums : Fijacion Oral vol.1 and Oral Fixation vol.2 . Effectively this release of two different albums by her in one year garnered her acclaim and force-fed hungry fans with new music . I do n't own Fijacion Oral but I own Oral Fixation . Compared to Laundry Service , this album is more mature , far more , and contains no Spanish lyrics.I first thought that Shakira had lost some of her 2001 magic , when I listened to this album but after further observation I realised she had just matured , hugely . She has swapped her looks for her honest lyrics and superb voice.I really like the first single Do n't Bother , but there are some other gems on here as well such as : Timor , How Do You Do , Costume Makes The Clown and Animal City.Shakira seems to have invoked her spiritual side on this album , the first murmurs on this album are a part of The Lord 's Prayer.Shakira is more of a true woman than her previous manufactured latino sex-symbol self . She even dismisses her previous self on Costume Makes The Clow with this lyric : `` Told you I felt lucky with my humble breasts , well I do n't . `` Oral Fixation vol.2 features guest appearances by Carlos Santana and Gustavo Cerati , but this really is Shakira 's album.She is trying to come to terms with who she is and learning to love herself.2005 was a great year for music and a highlight of that was this album 's release . Oral Fixation will sound 'fresh ' even twenty years from now . At just over 42 minutes I would have liked to hear just a little bit more of Shakira , maybe 55:30.That way I would get more to satisfy me until her next album rolls around.Overall , Shakira 's latest album is more of an interview with the woman than anything else , she lays everything down on the table from her goal setting to her annoyance at the situation in East Timor . She reveals things we never thought she would , Shakira in a new light . I hope the haters of Shakira stop the moaning about her so-called 'horrible ' voice , heck her voice is amazing , is n't originality what it 's all about ?	1
Shakira is one of those wonderful artists who is n't afraid to make an album with many styles thrown into the mix . Saying that , there is undeniably that Shakira 'sound ' prevalent throughout the album . Vol 1 was a stunning ( and long overdue ) follow up to Laundry Service , and she wrote so many songs during that recording session , that she split them into 2 , the Spanish language Vol 1 , and this , the English Vol 2.2 of the tracks are English versions of a couple of the best tracks taken from vol 1 , 'The Day and Time ' ( Dia especial ) and 'Something'- ( En tu pupilas ' ) and the rest , a stunning mix of styles ( though cleverly never abandoning her musical heritage ) , Mexican trumpets , Church Male vocal choirs opening the cd on 'How Do You Know ' , Carlos Santana provides guitar on 'Illegal ' , and even children supplying backing vocals on the African sounding 'Timor ' which brilliantly closes the album . This is a fantastic , upbeat album , which proves Shakiras undoubtably the worlds greatest Spanish language artist.I 've marked it a 4 simply because there were a couple of other songs on Vol 1 I would liked to have had translated and I feel that Vol 1 had even stronger material .	1
The cover featuring Shakira 'Eve & The Original Sin ' is a classic theme that basically attributes to Even one more reason to bite the forbidden fruit-that would be her oral fixation : That 's Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll , Latin America 's most successful pop female crossover artist and my fav , I rave for Shakira ! She sways so provocative with the most sexiest dazzling flare but thats how she grew up dancing as music flow naturally in her veins . Her Hips do n't Lie is number one song in my Chart followed by Hey You and Illegal with the classic Carlos Santana playing on sexiest guitar strings . Hips do n't lie is Rapped vocals from Wyclef Jean and Shakira 's familiar Spanish-accented is rocking , Dance like this ... .very groovy . The way she rolls her back and moves her hips , well it 's a workout all in itself in its latest video of Hips do n't lie . How do you do is just a bunch of questions we wonder as human beings . Animal city chills with inventive moments with her loud vocals too good to resist . Overall , I 'd say - Laundry Service was Great but Oral Fixation Vol 2 ( included Hips do n't lie ) is Best of the Best and *Five Stars* A more matured and focused Shakira who is much in touch with a woman inside her - delightful to the sense . A must Pick . Just Chill .	1
`` How Do You Do '' , one of the highlights of the album , questions what God is all about . She asks `` What language do you speak , if you speak at all ? '' and wonders what he thinks about what is going on in the world today , in his name , when she sings in the second verse , `` How many people die and hurt in your name ? Hey , does that make you proud or does it bring you shame ? `` , while saying `` you 've made mistakes/well , that 's okay ` cause we all have '' . It does n't slam god or a higher being , but asks questions I 'm sure we 've all thought about at some point when it comes to religion . She asks `` Are you happy ? Do you ever cry ? `` `` Do n't Bother '' is another great one , an ode to her boyfriend , or soon-to-be ex boyfriend , however you want to look at it . She tells him not to worry that he 's leaving her for another woman because that woman is better than she 'll ever be . She says `` Do n't bother , I 'll be fine/I wo n't die of deception '' while at the same time challenges him when she sings `` I 'm sure she does n't know how to touch you like I would/I beat her at that one good '' . I think this song portrays how someone would feel if this happened to them . It 's basically the hurt , the anger , the acceptance , the questioning all in one . `` Illegal '' , which features Santana , is a song about her being so hurt and betrayed by someone that she starts to think it should be a crime to deceive a woman . `` The Day and the Time '' was featured on her spanish album `` Fijacion Oral Vol.1 '' , as well as the song `` Something '' . They 're nice tracks , nothing too amazing here.With `` Animal City '' , I do n't like the chorus , but the lyrics in the verses are amazing . She sings about fame ( `` They believe you now have everything you wanted/and once you have become a star you got no right to bitch/But someday when you fail they 'll put you on sale and buy you by the inch '' ) and fortune ( `` Your family got bigger when they thought you were rich/ And now like maniacs they scratch your back even when it does n't itch '' ) . `` Dreams For Plans '' and `` Your Embrace '' are nice , but once again nothing to spectacular . However , `` Dreams For Plans '' is really growing on me . `` Hey You '' is one of my favorites on the album , where Shakira sings about how she 'd do anything for the guy she 's with , and how it 's an offer he ca n't refuse . I love when she sings `` I 'd like to be the owner of the zipper on your jeans '' . `` Costume makes the clown '' is another good one , where she 's singing about how fame has changed her , and not in a good way . When people treat you a certain way and dress you up a certain way , you start to act like that person , which is the message I think she 's trying to convey . `` Timor '' is my second favorite song of the album ( behind `` How Do You Do '' ) . It 's about our ignorance of the world around us . She sings sarcastically about how the `` good '' guys are in power and the bad guys are in jail , and how we 'll be okay because we live in a democracy and can vote . Basically it 's saying , as long as we 're okay and everything is going good around here then that 's all that matters , and not say , the genocide in East Timor.Whew ! Anyways , I do like her first English album ( Laundry Service ) a little better , but it 's still good nonetheless . One complaint with the album is that I wish she 'd had more songs on it , because there are only 11 . And I do n't understand Spanish at all ( even though I took it for three years in high school ) , but Fijacion Oral Vol.1 is a good album that 's worth checking out .	1
Shakira looks so great as Eve holding the apple on the cover to her newest album . And ... what 's up with that poor baby in the tree ? This album cover is absolutely fantastic , and has to be one of the best of 2005 ! The music behind the cover is pretty good too . `` DO N'T BOTHER '' is a great song and video , with Shakira at her weirdest and best ! The rest of the album keeps a relatively good balance between catchy dance tunes , grinding rock numbers , and a ballad or two thrown in for good measure . If you are looking for a great Christmas gift this year , give this album !	1
Product Description : This is a Japan only-pressing edition . So I 'm sure in america you wo n't get much chance to get this release . It costs around 28 dollars in Japan ( exactly 3150 yen w/tax ) . It 's a really great package , contains 1 CD & 1 DVD.CD : All 13 track from the reissued edition of Oral Fixation V2.Plus a Do n't Bother Remix ( jrsnchz remix ) which is pretty good . Total 14 tracks.DVD : Contains 2 videos : Do n't Bother & Hips Do n't Lie . Of course the package is really exclusive , remembering Hips video is n't released officially.If you want to search it , the cover is exactly the same with Hips Do n't Lie CD-Single ( only the outcover , the booklet still same with audio CD edition ) . Do n't be confused . If you a realrealreal big fan of Shakira , YES , I recomend this extremely-exclusive package for you .	1
Oral Fixation , Vol . 2 is a bit of a surprise : it 's a deadly serious , ambitious pop/rock album , most assuredly not frivolous dance-pop . Even when the album dives into pulsating neo-disco , it 's in the form of a protest song in the closer , `` Timor , '' which is n't exactly by the numbers pop . And that 's a short description of Oral Fixation , Vol . 2 in general -- it 's pop , but it 's unconventional.Shakira sings about everything from love to religion , stopping along the way to reveal that women with 24-inch waists may indeed be heartbroken . If some of these ideas do n't necessarily gel , at least Oral Fixation , Vol . 2 is alive with ambition and , more often than not , Shakira winds up with music that is distinctive as both songs and recordings . And that means that Oral Fixation , Vol . 2 is not only a markedly different album from Fijaci & oacute ; n Oral , but from every other record in her catalog -- or , most importantly , from any other pop album released during 2005.Other artists may be bigger than Shakira while others may make more fully realized albums , but as of the mid-2000s no other pop artist has attempted as much and achieved as much as Shakira , as this often enthralling album proves . [ Oral Fixation , Vol . 2 was reissued four months after its original release with a slightly different sequencing and two new tracks : `` Hips Do n't Lie , '' which features Wyclef Jean ( who shouts out `` Shakira '' every 20 seconds or so ) , and a Spanglish version of `` La Tortura , '' a song from Fijaci & oacute ; n Oral .	1
Shakira is a wonderful lyricist , This album is one of the best written i 've heard in a long time and it 's filled with wonderful beautiful reflective ballads . I guess the reason all these people gave her mixed reviews is because they were excpecting to hear a Hip shaking Romper of an album due to the worldwide smash single `` Hips Do n't Lie '' and the salacious album cover.Instead we find here a wonderful mixture of pop/rock diddies that send tingles up and down your spine due to the sweet melancholy and rawness of her voice and the sincerity of the lyrics.I applaud Shakira for making an English album full of actual music instead of crossing over to most of the trash that plagues American mainstream radio these days.I absolutely love this album and enjoy every minute of it . Every Lyrics , Melody and dulcet Harmony.Thank you so much for this album brilliantly written album Shakira ! ! I Love you ! My Top 51 . Your Embrace2 . Do n't Bother3 . Dreams For Plans4 . How Do You Do5 . Costume Makes The ClownThis album is not for the weak minded , Approach it with an open heart and you will be rewarded.Phenomenal . A Must Get ! !	1
I was really looking forward to hearing more from Shakira after her wonderful album `` Laundry Service '' and this album was worth the wait . My favourite song would have to be the hit single `` Do n't Bother '' with its very inventive lyrics and the video clip offers a few suggestions for any woman that has been cheated on . This fine Colombian lady has a unique singing voice and I am glad to see that she is still getting the recognition that she deserves in the Western Anglo Saxon world of popular music .	1
Just months after her all spanish album Fijacion Oral vol . 1 Shakira is back with her English conquest Oral Fixation vol . 2 , a great album from the Latin singer . Shakira is back with her 'acquired taste ' vocals , bringing a powerful punch for those who want to listen . What has Shakira done to step it up since her 2001 successful effort `` Laundry Service '' ? Well , most notably she has stepped it up lyrically . Also , in my opinion her voice has only gotten better , though like I stated before , he vocals are an ` acquired taste'.Things start off on great notes , such as the questioning religion track `` How Do You Do '' and the full fired lead single `` Do n't Bother '' . Sure , on paper `` Do n't Bother '' does n't look like much , but when in action it 's great . By the third track it 's reached one of the two best numbers with `` Illegal '' ft. Carlos Santana . Everything about the song is perfect , lyrically it 's superb , vocally she 's never been better , and the whole mood of the track is so laid back you could rest a baby on it.The second track to take top honors would be `` Dreams For Plans '' . Everything from the instrumentals to the lyrics are beautiful . And though it 's a `` say goodbye '' song , one will put that aside and instead smile at the elegance of it all . Also , one can enjoy songs such as the unique `` Animal City '' , the funky `` Timor '' , and the seductive `` Your Embrace '' where Shakira harps `` Tell me what 's the use of a 24 '' waist/ If you do n't touch me '' . So what exactly brings this album down . Easy , `` Hey You '' is just plain bad . It 's irritating to the point I had to skip to the next track . And though not horrible , `` The Day and the Time '' ft. Gustavo Cerati can get just plain boring.However , only two tracks are lacking the quality in which the rest of the album does more than make up for . So anyone who is a fan of Shakira should pick Oral Fixation vol . 2 up . Shakira has really outdone her self as an artist in her career . She 's gone from dominating Mexican Air waves , to dominating America in a style all to her own . Congratulations should be given to such a loyal artist who despite mainstream ways , has never changed hers .	1
It 's been a long wait , her first English speaking album `` Laundry Service '' was released in 2001 , 4 years ago and she joined the group of `` Latino '' singers like Ricky Martin , Marc Anthony and later Thalia and Paulina Rubio that successfully took the big step from the Latin to the global market and recorde a english album that become a commercial success . On `` Laundry Service '' she gave us many hits `` Whenever Wherever '' being the catchy uptempo top single , self penned `` Objection '' giving some tango influences and `` Underneath Your Clothes '' proving she was good on ballads too . Her English debut album , did have spanish songs too , something that `` Oral Fixation vol 2 '' does n't have . No , earlier this year she recorded a spanish speaking album with the suitable title `` Fijaci & oacute ; n Oral Vol 1 '' that entirely had songs in Spanish , it was a good message to her old fans from Latin America , that her priority was still them , it was her first Spanish album since 1998 . `` La Tortura '' feauring Alejandro Sanz was a massive hit all over Europe just the same . However , hearing her recording a follower to `` Laundry Service '' is far more exciting to me , since it is obvious that whatever she records in Spanish will sell well all over latin america anyway ( and also in other countries ) . One thing that I was surprised with her 2 Oral Fixation albums though is that none of the songs appear on both albums , it 's almost like 2 completely new albums in the matter of a few months or a double album released in 2 rounds , which is pretty amazing.So , does she follow up her success with this album ? Defenitely . This album is both strong , catchy and interesting . The major diffrence between her happy dance-pop debut is that many of the songs are very serious , still cathcy pop but the lyrics deal with subject such as faith , politics and relationships . The music itself is a mix of adult contemporary pop and latin dance vibes . On `` How Do You Do '' which is bound to became a massive hit , there are church choirs used , kind of like Enigma . It 's a rock song and it 's cathcy as hell . `` Do n't Bother '' is almost equally good , it 's about a competiting woman that think she 's better then others cause she looks and acts like the `` perfect '' woman . Shakira even goes as far as saying `` For you , I 'd give up all I own , And move to a communist country '' . On `` Illegal '' Carlos Santana appears with some great guitar riffs . The song is about sadeness from a relationship `` You said you would love me until you died , And as far as I know you 're still alive '' . Another highlight here . `` The Day and the Time '' feautures Gustavo Cerati , it 's a catchy midtempo . `` Animal City '' starts with her trademark hymns like on `` Whenever '' 4 years prior and it 's very spanish influented musically `` 'Cause it 's an animal city , It 's a cannibal world , So be obedient , do n't argueSome are ready to bite you '' , I think it 's about how celebrity status can be bad for a relationship and the animals symbolizes people that want to destroy it for you . `` Dreams for Plans '' is another love song in a very slow pace though . It feaurues accostic guitars and feel like typical adult contemporary music . `` Hey You '' got this catchy starts with horns . it 's a little jazzy , the hook reminds me of Petula Clark 's `` Downtown '' . It 's a odd number here . `` Your Embrace '' is another romantic ballad , starting verse sais it all `` Tell me , what 's the use Of the twenty-four inch waist , If you do n't touch me ? Tell me , what 's the use again Of being on TV every day , If you do n't watch me ? '' `` Costume Makes the Clown '' It 's another rather diffrent number , it starts very rocky and seems like a mix of rock and powerballad . `` Something '' is a slow number . Almost Katie Melua . The Closer `` Timor '' is one of the best songs , it 's very unique for 2 reasons . It sound like some Neo-Disco that Kylie Minogue would be proud of , and it 's a protest song . `` It 's alright , it 's alright , The planet 's split in three 'Cause I 'll keep on selling records , And you 've got your MTV '' This part sais it all.Overall , This is a fantastic album that proves that the 4 years away were well spent , it offers you meliodic pop-rock with some latin influnce but always focus on good lyrics and worhtwile hooks apart from beats and over-productions that others have done . Possibly one of the best if not the best pop album this year . Wether it will sell more then certain other pop artists , Shakira has archived much more by proving that she 's a fantastic pop singer that can both make good albums in english and spanish and that she was far from a `` One Album Wonder '' with Laundry Service '' , If you like traditional pop music that is rich on variation , lyrics and melodies here you have the one album to buy for christmas . You wo n't get dissapointed .	1
1 . How do you do 9/10 i like the use of the lords prayer and other relgious songs in it . pretty uninspiring title..and i do n't like the message . being a christian , but i like the way it sounds.2 . Do n't Bother 7/10 its okay..good rock song..but why it was the lead single..i 'll never understand . but i do like this new direction she has introduced to her english speaking audience3 . Illegal 9/10 did n't like it initally..but yeah i think it 's laidback and wonderful4 . The Day and the time 5/10 of all the songs she could have redone off of volume 1 she picks , this one ? ? ? 5 . Animal City 10/10 this song kicks ass ! ! ! ! 6 . Dreams for plans 10/10 i love the chorus , one of my faves7 . Hey you 7/10 why she does weird songs like this , i 'll never understand..but it does remind me of `` rules '' off her first english album8 . Your Embrace 10/10 again she uses weird examples like , `` 24 inch waist '' and on the last album `` have to shave me legs every morning '' but the chorus is great . good love song.9 . Costume makes the clown 9/10 good rock song..like the werid string part ! ! rocks for sure ! 10 . Something 6/10 and again..there were other songs she could have translated11 . Timor 10/10 best on the album.. very cool different . funny , and has a serious edge ! Overall : could have been better but definitely a good follow ip to its predesscor ! !	1
I do like this . It took a couple of listens to before I really started to enjoy it more . I can not - CAN NOT - stop listening to Hips Do n't Lie . I love that song . I could keep listening to it until forever . Other than that fantastic song , there is Hey You ( upbeat and cool ) and Your Embrace ( a really nice ballad ) . There are some songs on here I still do n't like . Some are a bit political and I personally do n't like that influence in the music I listen to.There are a lot of artists today that do n't write their own music or lyrics . She has written all the lyrics and the majority of music which proves how talented she is . This is a cool and funky album - well worth checking out . It 's got quite a few potential hits on it .	1
Unlocking her lips , the doors to her secret world Shakira offers listeners one of the most enjoyable hours in current discography . `` Oral Fixation Vol.2 '' , second part to her epic double release `` Fijacion Oral '' / '' Oral Fixation '' is easily the best album the Colombian superstar has released to date.Smart , fast , creative , emotional and edgy at the same time , Shakira is more gutsy and confident than ever here.Labelling this as pop music is an extremely simplistic and frivolous approach because this is hardly conventional pop . How many pop artists have been as experimental and artistic as Shakira is here ? A lot of the material here would n't sound out of place in a Tori Amos album ( from her old good days , that is ) and Shakira 's thorough and powerful form of protest here ( on songs like `` Animal City '' and `` Timor '' ) is deeply political and never put-on . Also , she knows how to talk about love , in ways few artsts can . She is as revealing and erotic as she wants to be , sounding light years ago from the sappy-or-crude dilemma of modern pop and much closer to Liz Phair than Britney . `` How Do You Do ? '' a torrent of worry and doubt addressed to God is chillingly brilliant , powerful beyond belief . If her previous work ( and the two translated songs from it here , `` The Day and the Time '' and `` Something '' ) was all about hooking up and reaching happiness , this is the opposite , an album on what happens after the happy ending , full of bitterness and irony . `` Do n't Bother '' is a bitter ( albeit addictive ) meditation on the status of modern relationships , sung from the position of `` the other woman '' . `` Illegal '' , featuring Carlos Santana , is a typical but effective heartbreak ballad , but it 's the theatrical rocker `` Costume Makes the Clown '' that drives the point home . `` I 'm taking the makeup off my face/before I forget my own features '' , she sings right before tearing her lover apart . `` Dreams for Plans '' is another of these tracks , describing the way time affects people and relationships . It is a heartwrenching elegie on disorientation , change and alienation , and Shakira 's description is frighteningly accurate.Shakira alternates with surprising agilty between hunter and prey . On the sexy `` Hey You '' , she challenges someone in every way , whereas the delicate ballad `` Your Embrace '' features a fragile Shakira craving for her loved one.Shakira has never done better than this , using her mouth to pray , express , cry , protest , kiss and speak freely . But judging from the power of her work on this album , we 've seen nothing yet .	1
Shakira has had a big year this year . It is amazing that her lead single from her first release of 2005 , the Spanish-language album FIJACION ORAL , VOL . 1 , `` La Tortura '' did so amazing on the pop radio . Furthermore , the album did n't do bad itself scoring a large scan for a Latin album . Now , Shakira returns with her English Language ORAL FIXATION , VOL . 2 , which is of course the second album of the double album.Shakira remarkably on ORAL FIXATION , VOL . 2 sounds very similar to Canadian Alt-Pop singer Alanis Morissette . At times , you could even mistake Shakira to be Alanis because like Alanis , Shakira has the unique bends and inflections within her vocals . It is definitely a unique voice that sits very well in the production for the most part , but , at times Shakira slightly overdoes the inflections and they grow grating . Again , for the most part , Shakira 's unmistakable vocals are right on and are as sensual and sexy as `` La Totura '' was on FIJACION ORAL , VOL . 1.There is very little filler material on this album , which for the most part leave genuine hits . The production throughout this album is especially well done as Shakira incredibly crosses over between latin and U.S.A. pop on such songs as the concluding `` Timor '' and the trumpet-influenced tracks of `` Animal City '' and `` Hey You '' . At other times , Shakira sounds more pop-ish with tracks like the incredible `` Dreams For Plans '' , `` Your Embrace '' , or great first single `` Do n't Bother '' . Unfortunately , this songs may not end up being as popular as her sexy Latin hit `` La Tortura '' was , but they all make for a very nice rounded pop album . There are no real complaints here ; the material for the most part is inspired , though it might take a few listens to get the full inspiration of some of the songs . 3.5 to 4 stars .	1
Shakira caught my attention a few years back with `` Laundry Service '' and I also got into her Spanish music . This new cd `` Oral Fixation 2 '' is simply amazing . It is very very unique and heart felt . Some people say her emotions are n't always present in her English albums but I beg to differ . I also really enjoy listening to this music/lyrics because I know Shakira wrote the lyrics/music herself . This makes an album more emotional and worth buying . Haunting music and backgrounds as in `` How Do You Do '' are outstanding . I recommend this album for anyone who is willing to try a new category in music . Here is a breakdown : How Do You Do- 5/5Do n't Bother- 4/5Illegal- 3.5/5The Day and the Time- 4/5Animal City- 5/5Dreams for Plans- 3.5/5Hey You- 4/5Your Embrace- 3.5/5Costume Makes the Clown- 4/5Something- 3.5/5Timor- 5/5Hips Do n't Lie- 4.5/5	1
Shakira is one of my favourite artist to ever grace the earth . she is a natural performer that shows that she can handle being with the big dogs . she has had career triumphs ( 2001 's brilliant LAUNDRY SERVICE & 2005 's FIJACION ORAL vol . 1 ) . but it would be wrong if i compared ORAL FIXATION vol . 2 to its predessors . this album is not a banger but it does have joints to bob your head to . 'how do you do ' , 'timor ' , 'illegal ' w/ carlos santana , & 'costume makes the clowm ' are my favourite songs on the album . each had a distinct taste that pleases the ear.the only song i think is not right for the album was 'do n't bother ' . this song in particular is not a instant smash that catches me fast enough . its a great track but it took me a while to appreciate it . also 'animal city ' is kind of a lackluster.this album is not a complete smash like her last three albums but this one has just enough pop to keep you interested.4 out of 5 stars : the album cover is a plus as well	1
Shakira sings english on this album and her lastest single and music video is `` Do n't Bother '' of course a latin tune . This to me is not as good as vol . 1 but the soul purpose she sings in english on this album is gon na make people want to buy it even more.The songs that appear on this album that were also on the previous album vol.1 are `` Something '' and `` The Day and the Time '' other great songs on the album include . `` Hey You '' , `` Illegal '' which features Carlos Santana , and `` Animal City ''	1

I have always liked Shakira . When I heard `` Whenever , wherever '' ... I though : that 's a great artist . She is not only good singer but also very beautfiul . The album cover is very beautiful this time and it has a message : a woman with an apple ... but what is that child ? Well , I think this is the best Shakira album ever ! ! ! It has very beautiful songs . The single `` Do n't Bother '' is n't the best song in this album . This is one of those album I like to hear from the beginning to the end , not just three or two songs . The first track `` How Do You Do '' is a great track ! It starts with a great `` intro '' . It is the best Shakira song I 've ever heard . `` Do n't Bother '' is a good song but not so special . `` Illegal '' , `` The day And the Time '' are great Shakira songs . `` Animal City '' is a little bit more rock . The album has great melodies and rhythms and great lyrics . This was and it is still a great listening experience . I hope many people find this album . `` Timor '' is a great closing track - but this album has also 10 other great songs.Stars : How Do You Do , Illegal , Do n't Bother	1
Just to make it short and sweet.GREAT TRACKS : How Do You DoIllegalCostume Makes The ClownYour EmbraceDECENT TRACKS : SomethingTimorThe Day and the TimeYour EmbraceHORRID TRACKS : Pretty much all the singles , and Hey You.Overall I 'm not a Shakira or modern pop fan , but I think this is a solid album and a good way to kill some time . Recommended , just as long as you 're prepared to hit the `` skip '' button a few times .	1
I really love Shakira . I think she is fantastic and I love this cd . I think the songs are very good and for someone who loves her I think they will feel the same way I do when I say ' `` Where is the Shakira that we fell in love with ? '' I mean this cd is not bad , I love How Do You Do , and other songs on the cd . But whoever said that this cd takes her back to her Donde Estan Los Ladrones ? days was definately listening to the wrong cd . Ther are no songs like whenever whereever , estoy aqui , pies descalzos , bruta ciega sordomudo , or ojos asi . This cd is prety much a slow pretty boring album . I like singers like Jewel and sarah mclachlan , so to me it is fine . Honestly no one who is not a fan now is going to be a fan from this album and some of the fans looking for that lovable Shakira will not find her here . I wish she would have added some more of her upbeat fun dance tracks on this cd but that is the way it is .	1
After the release of `` Fijacion oral vol 1 '' , earlier this year , Shakira returns with `` Oral fixation vol . 2 '' , a new album , written in english , with a great collection of songs . `` Do n't bother '' , the first single , is a pop-rock song , with a catchy chorus , about a regular girl who is replaced by the perfect girl and looks for revenge . This CD also brings us great surprises , like `` Dreams for plans '' , one of my favorite songs so far . Illegal is a song about the promisses men make to women and has the participation of Santana , with his classic guitar arrengements . I also like `` Timor '' , which was a great surprise to me . Deep lyrics in a pop tune . `` The day and the time '' is the english version for `` Dia especial '' , taken from `` Fijacion oral vol 1 '' and it is as great as the original . `` Hey you '' and `` animal city '' are singles in potential and mix the latin rhytms with lousy guitars , a style always present in Shakira songs.Well , Shakira has taken a long road since the beginning of her career in Colombia.Even though Shakira has become one of the most popular singers in the world , she is still very down to earth , always concerned with the quality of her albums , which improve everytime she goes back to charts . Do n't think twice and buy it !	1
Written and produced by Shakira Oral fixation 2 finds her at all time creative high . The song `` Do n't Bother '' is the first single it was release on AOL and is available on radio stations . Digital store 's such a s iTunes started offering the song for download . I saw the video clip on MTV 's Making the Video . The ablum debuted at # 5 , selling 128,000 copies its opening week .	1
There is no doubt that Shakira is a major force in both the Latino and Anglo music industries , and her latest album `` Oral Fixaton , Vol . 2 '' helps continue her ascent to legendary status . Still , listeners expecting an album full of soaring vocals and syrupy romance as showcased on last summer 's magnificent `` Fijacion Oral , Vol . 1 '' will be surprised by an album characterized by many different themes and styles.The oddity is that `` Vol . 1 , '' which was a completely Spanish disc , debuted even higher on the Billboard chart , scoring the best sales week for any non-English album . Also , lead single `` La Tortura , '' the slick , sexy party record featuring Alejandro Sanz that was unstoppable through the fall and became the most successful Spanish single ever released , peaked far higher on the Billboard Hot 100 than `` Do n't Bother , '' the lead single from `` Vol . 2 , '' which fizzled at # 42 despite an impassioned performance , catchy hook and lingual advantage . Still , the English disc is a rarity among pop music ; it is experimental and interesting.The ball starts rolling with the hair-rising `` How Do You Do ? , '' a track that has been cut from the album in the Far East do to its outrightly calling God to task . `` How do you do ? /How does it feel to be so high ? /Are you happy ? Do you ever cry ? /You 've made mistakes , well that 's okay ` cause we all have/But if I forgive yours , will you forgive mine ? `` She also breathes new life into `` Dia Especial '' from `` Vol . 1 '' with `` The Day and the Time , '' which tells the tale of a stormy relationship that triumphs over obstacles . She perfectly recaptures the mood of the original incarnation and sings like her very life depends on it , much like she does on the heartrending ballad `` Your Embrace . `` `` Hope it is n't too late to say I love you/Hope it is n't too late to say/That without you this place looks like London , it rains everyday/Do n't you know it babe , I 'm only half a body/Without your embrace . `` Meanwhile , the melancholy `` Dreams For Plans '' shimmers beneath sparkling production , while `` Hey You '' is a slinky piece of flirtatious fun ensconced in mariachi horns that brings levity to the album . She also sings out for those oppressed by war in the courageous `` Timor '' and provides her best chance at a hit single with `` Illegal , '' a refreshingly understated piece that derives an awesome punch from Carlos Santana 's playing and belittles those who play games with others ' hearts.Despite a few tracks that would have been better left off the record in favor of others , especially `` Something , '' a dissapointing translation of the unbelievable `` En Tus Pupilas '' from `` Vol . 1 , '' one fact can not be denied : Shakira does not rest on her laurels , but instead consistently challenges herself as a writer and prompts her audience to think , feel and care . There is something to be said for that , especially from a woman who not long ago barely knew any English .	1
Shakira came along during the Latin explosion of the late 90 's except unlike many who populated the genre , she was n't born and raised in the United States nor was English her first language . Her lack of experience in the language showed on her first English speaking album , Laundry Service , she made up in presentation and was much more experimental than the Latin pop of Jennifer Lopez or Ricky Martin whose songs all sounded alike.After taking a couple years off , Shakira came back this year with two albums , back in July she released the Spanish language Fijacion Oral vol . 1 ( translation Oral Fixation ) that featured La Tortura , a song with so much sexual tension even American did n't need a translation , and more recently she released the English language Oral Fixation vol . 2 ( translation Fijacion Oral ) . There are two songs that overlap both albums , the lovely Something and the uplifting The Day and the Time.Volume 2 actually starts of with some people chanting the Lords Prayer . I think this is the first time chanting was included in a pop song since Enigma scored their only hit with Sadness part 1 . But the song , How Do You Do , quickly turns into a rocker about the violence that surrounds religion with lyrics like , `` How many people die , and hurt in your name ? Hey , does that make you proud , or does it bring you shame ? '' Apparently George Bush and Osama bin Laden have the answers.After the opener , Shakira deals with a failed relation on Do n't Bother and Illegal , the later which feature Carlos Santana and his trademark guitar and sound like a more somber version Underneath Your Clothes claiming `` it should be illegal to break a woman 's heart . '' Do n't Bother , on the other hand is a more upbeat kiss-off to a former flame who is trying to reunite.Even though this time around Shakira seems to master the English language a little better , her strong point is still in the presentation . And it seems as if she has been listening to a lot of American 80 's since her last album . During How Do You Do , there is a guitar solo that song very similar to Edie Brickell 's What I Am , while on Do n't Bother , the guitars seemed to be borrowed from the Cure 's Just Like Heaven . The bouncy Hey You sounds like something out of the Stray Cats catalog had a female been the lead singer . And she even seems influenced by bands who themselves like the 80 's retro sound as The Day and the Time sound much like The Killer 's Smile Like You Me It . But she does go old school Latin music with the inclusion of mariachi horns on Animal City . But in each case she is able to make it her own.The album ends much like it starts off but instead it 's a children 's choir that does the chanting on yet another 80 's influenced Timor which relays heavy on synthesizers and drum loops . But instead of religion , politics is the topic with the kids asking throughout the song , `` How about the people who do n't matter anymore ? '' Taking aim at the apathy that plagues the youth around the wealthy world who care more about what 's on MTV than those less fortunate who are dieing whether it be by war or by hunger .	1
Shakira is a skank . `` Oral Fixation '' she so cleverly calls her most recent output of overtly sexual bile . And the cover to match . Clearly she has to flaunt herself to the world this way since she clearly does n't have enough time to give everyone in the world a lapdance in person . Oh , she 's just trying to be sexy , you say . No , she passed sexy years ago and took a left turn towards media prostitution . I do n't care if she has an ounce of singing ability ( and I 'm sure you know about the technology in the recording studio these days ) , that 's clearly not what she 's selling.So why the five stars ? I simply think it 's hilarious she 's duped you all , and that deserves something does n't it ?	1
I liked the first version of the cd when it was released last year . Then they re-released it with 2 extra songs and I just had to re-buy it . `` Hips Do n't Lie '' is a great dance song which spices up the album , which originally only had one `` dance '' type song on it . However , the sound quality of `` Hips Do n't Lie '' for some reason sounds a little muffled like it was recorded cheaply , not cool . Total , the whole cd is fantastic . The only complaint I have is I wish they could have released the cd with ALL of the songs on it , i had to buy it twice , not cool . My feeling is , you have to be in the mood to hear Shakira , she is in a class of her own , she has a unique style of singing and her lyrics are deep and at times , bizarre . I like to play the cd from start to finish , it really puts you in Shakira 's world . I am a new fan , and I hope Shakira 's star continues to shine . She is one of the more creative artists around right now , and boy do we need that in pop music ! ! ! ! Go 'head Shakira .	1
This is one of Eddie Kendrick 's only CD he did before he died I believe from cancer . Eddie Kendrick was a very shy but excellent singer and the Temptations lost a legend when they lost his voice . This CD proves it .	1
Eddie Kendrick ( s ) had the most successful solo career of all the members of The Temptations . & # 34 ; All By Myself & # 34 ; , his debut may not have had a strong single to lead but Mr. Kendrick ( s ) did deliver on songs like & # 34 ; Can I ? & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Did n't We & # 34 ; . By the sophomore effort , & # 34 ; People ... .Hold On & # 34 ; , he found that much needed signature song in the dramatic , engulfing & # 34 ; Girl You Need a Change of Mind & # 34 ; . I first heard it at the club level in New York City . It 's near 8 minute length was near epic and it was one of those rare times when fans got their first taste of the forthcoming disco era . But , unlike the hundreds of thousands of mindless disco songs that would be forthcoming , & # 34 ; Girl You Need a Change of Mind & # 34 ; featured chord changes and progressions that were without peer up until that point . On the same album , & # 34 ; Date with the Rain & # 34 ; is part upgraded Motown Sound merging with the Sound of Philadelphia , in its infancy . In less than 3 minutes , this ranks as one of the best post Sound of Young America era.By the third , self-titled album , Eddie found the ultimate pop and R & B ; success to truly celebrate his arrival as a solo artist . The trajectory of Eddie 's recording career is so beautifully captured in these first 3 albums . It is a testament to the genius of Motown and Berry Gordy . ( few , if any label , would show the tenacity to stick with an artist for three albums today ... .though Eddie built upwards with each release ) . In a near perfect game plan , his 4th outing would bring him all the way too the top .	1
For Motown fans the world over , this November 2006 American HIP-O SELECT 2CD set represents something of a long overdue treat - Eddie Kendricks forgotten and hard to find US album catalogue finally on CD - and in a top quality manner ... Here 's the breakdown : Disc 1 ( 72:04 minutes ) : Tracks 1 to 7 are his debut US solo album , `` All By Myself '' , issued April 1971 on Tamla TS 309Tracks 8 to 18 are his 2nd US album , `` People ... Hold On '' , issued May 1972 on Tamla T 315LDisc 2 ( 74:14 minutes ) : Tracks 1 to 8 are his 3rd US album , `` Eddie Kendricks '' , issued May 1973 on Tamla T 327LTracks 9 to 16 are his 4th US album , `` For You '' , issued November 1974 on Tamla T6-33551 ( There are no single versions nor any previously unreleased tracks of any kind on this set - they feature on the last disc of the companion volume - `` The Thin Man '' - The Motown Albums Vol.2 '' ( reviewed separately ) PACKAGING : Both CDs are Brown & Yellow with the Tamla World logo - aping the way the US LP labels would have looked , The 28-page booklet pictures both the LP sleeves front and rear in full colour , gives detailed notes on the song-writer and session players involved , lists US singles and their B-sides that came off each album ( details from the actual Motown session logs ) and there 's an essay on Hendricks ' career by noted Motown writer BRIAN CHIN . In between the exact reproduction of album sleeves are high-quality colour pictures of Kendricks from the early Seventies - in fact the booklet like the silver digipak that houses the whole thing - has an overall classy feel about it . But the best bit - as always with HIP-O SELECT - is the wonderful SOUND ... SOUND : All tracks have been remastered by one of Universal 's trio of in-houses wizard tape engineers - SUHA GUR - a name that has turned up on many of the `` Gold '' 2CD sets dedicated to other Motown acts . Typical of HIP-O SELECT , the sound is superlative and like the packaging , reeks of class and pride in what 's been presented to you . Stylistically , Kendricks ' high voice and the string-drenched arrangements of the songs sound like Eugene Record and The Chi-Lites . On other songs , it 's very Philadelphia International . On the downside , there is fairly audible hiss on some of the `` All By Myself '' tracks , but none too much to detract from the soulful listen . Besides , it all but disappears completely by the time we get to the next album , 1972 's fantasic `` People ... Hold On '' . You can now HEAR the drums and bass on `` Girl You Need A Change Of Mind '' like never before - funky , warm and sweet . Disc 2 simply offers up more of the same . A very sweet listen indeed.To sum-up , I can only add to the excellent and informative reviews that went before this - this is a great Motown set.A job well done by HIP-O SELECT - and one that will have you reaching for Volume 2 ...	1
Now whoever said that Eddie was all ballads and no funk surely has n't heard this wonderful set of 4 of his albums : ALL BY MYSELF , PEOPLE ... HOLD ON , EDDIE KENDRICKS , and FOR YOU . It brings a tear to my eye just to relive the wonderful moments I remember as a child in the 70s when my mum used to play these in the house almost on a constant basis ! ALL BY MYSELF , released in April 1971 ( # 6 R & B ; , # 80 Pop ) was Eddie 's first solo album after leaving the Temptations . LET 'S GO BACK TO DAY ONE is a funky opening with Eddie 's vocal multi-layered ala Marvin Gaye ! THIS USED TO BE THE HOME OF JOHNNIE MAE was the B-side of IT 'S SO HARD FOR ME TO SAY GOODBYE ( # 37 R & B ; , # 88 Pop ) and I DID IT ALL FOR YOU , a popular Quiet Storm tune , was the B-side to CAN I ( # 37 R & B ; , # 101 Pop ) , another popular Quiet Storm staple also performed by Brenda Holloway and most recently covered by Phil Perry . SOMETHING 'S BURNING starts off slow and ends with a funky ending and the Jimmy Webb composition , DID N'T WE close this set ! What 's wonderful is that the Temptations ' notes to Eddie originally printed on the back of the album are reprinted for this release ! PEOPLE ... HOLD ON , with its eye-catching photography by Weldon A. McDougal III , was originally released in May 1972 , which fared better on the charts ( # 13 R & B ; , # 131 Pop ) . According to the liner notes , Frank Wilson said in an interview for Eddie 's ULTIMATE COLLECTION ( 1998 ) that it was a concept album dedicated to black America . It opens with IF YOU LET ME ( # 17 R & B ; , # 66 Pop ) , originally performed by Jimmy Ruffin . LET ME RUN INTO YOUR LONELY HEART is the funky B-side to EDDIE 'S LOVE ( # 35 R & B ; , # 77 Pop ) while on DAY BY DAY , Eddie 's vocals are once again multi-layered . GIRL YOU NEED A CHANGE OF MIND is the biggest hit off here ( # 13 R & B ; , # 87 Pop ) with its innovative use of multi-drums throughout the track and still a favorite among club goers . SOMEDAY WE 'LL HAVE A BETTER WORLD has a gospel feel to it and reminiscent of Stevie Wonder 's HEAVEN HELP US ALL with Eddie singing in his natural register . MY PEOPLE ... HOLD ON is a major highlight here with African drums opening the song and on the break and DATE WITH THE RAIN is another dance favorite among today 's club goers . I 'M ON THE SIDELINE has Eddie 's voice once again multi-layered throughout the song and the album closes with JUST MEMORIES , the B-side to IF YOU LET ME and with it 's operatic opening , remains another highlight to this album.EDDIE KENDRICKS ( # 5 R & B ; , # 18 Pop ) , released in May 1973 , charted higher than the above , especially on the strength of the # 1 R & B ; /Pop hit KEEP ON TRUCKIN ' , most recently resurrected and remixed by DJ Spinna for the MOTOWN : REMIXED compilation ( 2005 ) . ONLY ROOM FOR TWO opens the album and the Caribbean-sounding DARLING COME BACK HOME ( # 26 R & B ; , # 67 Pop ) , was another hit off here . EACH DAY I CRY A LITTLE is IMO Eddie 's finest performance and also a Quiet Storm favorite while CA N'T HELP WHAT I AM is a light tune on being who he is . ANY DAY NOW ( originally performed by Chuck Jackson ) and NOT ON THE OUTSIDE ( originally performed by the Moments ) are underrated remakes of soul classics and Eddie makes it his own on both selections and the album closes with WHERE DO YOU GO ( BABY ) , a beautiful Pam Sawyer/Gloria Jones composition about Eddie wondering where his woman is when he is n't there.This compilation does n't include BOOGIE DOWN which followed EDDIE KENDRICKS , but according to the liner notes , it will be released in another double-disc set ! In the meantime , we get to hear FOR YOU , released November 1974 ( # 8 R & B ; , # 108 Pop ) . It opens with the laid-back PLEASE DO N'T GO AWAY , while ONE TEAR ( # 8 R & B ; , # 71 Pop ) , originally for Marvin Gaye and SHOESHINE BOY ( # 1 R & B ; , # 18 Pop ) became the biggest hits off of this album . DEEP AND QUIET LOVE is an underrated Quiet Storm performance while LET YOURSELF GO is another underrated funk performance . I played this one at one of my parties and the response was amazing ! IF YOU THINK ( YOU CAN ) has great word play throughout the song . IF is a great remake originally performed by Bread and TIME IN A BOTTLE is just as good , originally performed by Jim Croce , which ends the album.Folks , if you are not by now , this wonderfully packaged 2-CD set will make or renew your interest in Eddie Kendricks , IMO the greatest tenor that ever graced a record !	1
For years , we fans of the legendary Eddie James Kendricks ( 1939-1992 ) have prayed , written Motown endless letters and even waged an online petition to have this come to pass - to have all of Eddie 's original albums reissued on CD . I 've always felt that Eddie 's career as a soloist was never given its proper due because in the eyes of the industry , his work with the Temptations seemed to supercede everything he did on his own , and that was truly not fair . They wanted to boil his career down to two hits - `` Keep On Truckin ' '' and `` Boogie Down '' - and like nothing else he did was worthwhile . Motown continued to contribute to this mode of thinking as well . Please ! That is as far from the truth as you can get ! But finally , after so very long , some of Eddie 's original albums are now available on CD . In this collection , we have four remastered EJK CDs from the 1970s : ALL BY MYSELF ( 1971 ) PEOPLE ... HOLD ON ( 1972 ) EDDIE KENDRICKS ( 1973 ) FOR YOU ( 1974 ) These four albums are chock full of quality material by Eddie , all produced by the team of Frank Wilson and Leonard Caston ( except Eddie 's debut LP , which was produced by Wilson alone ) . Looking for early popular cuts by EJK like `` Can I '' , `` This Used To Be The Home Of Johnnie Mae '' , `` If You Let Me '' , `` Girl You Need A Change of Mind '' , `` Keep On Truckin ' '' and `` Shoeshine Boy '' ? Well , like the compilation of hits CDs that Motown has issued previously , those songs are all here ... but these are the albums where those choice cuts came from . Chronologically , the album BOOGIE DOWN from late 1973 - early '74 was completed and issued before FOR YOU . But due to the timing of the tracks on that album , BOOGIE DOWN could n't be included here ... but it will be in the next volume of Eddie 's works , which will be released later on in '06 . Be on the lookout for it.I am very happy with this collection , and the remastering is nearly flawless . Only complaint I have is the treatment of the seven-minute plus ballad `` Each Day I Cry A Little '' from the EDDIE KENDRICKS album . Filled with spoken passages and an emotionally devastating message , it 's so heartbreakingly beautiful , it has to be one of the very best in the entire EJK catalog . For those who have never heard this masterpiece , IMO , its closest comparison would probably be the Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes ' magnum opus `` I Miss You '' from 1972 - not so much by the sound , but because both these songs feature spoken passages and anguished vocals revealing men in emotional pain . However , the way it 's mixed here has too much echo , the background singers ' vocals are brought so far to the front at times you do n't hear much of Eddie , and the strings are a bit overpowering , especially halfway through and towards the end of the song . I have the original vinyl LP and the mix is different . But other than that , this is a perfect collection of four of Eddie 's excellent Motown solo albums . For anyone who has only brought Eddie 's greatest hits CDs in the past and craved to have more , this is an absolute MUST for you to own ! ! Want to know why Eddie is one of the greatest R & B ; legends of all time and why he will never be forgotten ? Song after song on this set shows the listener that this was no ordinary singer - here 's the proof . Listen and enjoy .	1
WHAT MORE CAN I SAY , THIS ALBUM IS A TOTAL PACKAGE.TRACKS SUCH AS 'CHANGE YOUR WORLD ' BEST DEFINE THE DIRECTION IN WHICH SOUL MUSIC MUST GO	1
Talk about a long time coming . That should 've been the name of Anthony Hamilton 's latest effort . After having two labels fold before you have a chance at getting your voice heard , Anthony Hamilton was still able to keep his mind right and his game tight . Popping up on the Nappy Roots ' song `` Po Folks '' would be the key to recapturing the faith of a label exec , this time around it being the eyes of Jermaine Dupri . He saw the potential Anthony Hamilton had from just that one song , but the legwork and the sacrifices that he must have had to endure must be astronomical considering he 's been trying since at least the mid-1990s to get noticed . Now after the platinum-selling `` debut '' album Comin From Where I 'm From and the rush release of the shelved Soulife album , Anthony Hamilton satisfies our soul with his latest effort Ai n't Nobody Worryin ' . `` Ca n't Let Go '' is a very strong statement for Mr. Hamilton to go with as the first single from the album . Not only does it refer to a relationship he does n't want to end , but it also parallels as his passion towards being the best singer he can be . `` Southern Stuff '' talks about the qualities he likes in a certain woman , while `` Sista Big Bones '' is a fun song about his admiration for the 'healthy ' girls out there . `` The Truth '' illustrates his devotion to being frank and honest about his love , and `` Change The World '' has a old-school vibe that the grown-up crowd can appreciate . `` I Know What Love 's All About '' is another one for the 'grown and sexy ' to enjoy while the more virtuous individuals will be partial to `` Pass Me Over . '' The title track `` Ai n't Nobody Worryin ' '' is the signature sound we experienced from his previous album , while Anthony offers up a little falsetto on `` Never Love Again . `` And even though I 'm not particularly fond of the style and delivery on `` Where Did It All Go , '' `` Everybody , '' and `` Preacher 's Daughter , '' they do n't detract that much from the flow of the rest of the album . Anthony Hamilton does an exceptional job of following up such a stellar album like his last disc . And with such a strong , built-in listening audience , Ai n't Nobody Worryin ' does in fact offer very little for Anthony Hamilton to be apprehensive about .	1
`` Ai n't Nobody Worrying '' is Anthony Hamilton 's true followup to his major label debut `` Coming From Where I 'm From . '' Earlier this year an album named `` Soullife '' was released . This CD was a CD Anthony recorded years ago that Rhino released this year.If you heard the first single `` Ca n't Let Go , '' and were n't quite sure about it , pick up the album . The album is hot like fire and I kind of question that first single choice . It 's a great song but others are better . The title track `` Ai n't Nobody Worryin ' , '' is a very soulful song that will remind listeners of Anthony 's song `` Coming From Where I 'm From . '' Another really great song on this album is `` Southern Stuff . '' `` Preacher 's Daughter '' is a stirring song kind of about how the preacher is so busy ministering to the world that he does n't pay attention to the daughter right there with him . Anthony has such a rich soulful voice and fans may not know that he suffered with a bout of bruised vocal chords earlier this year and thankfully he has recovered and his voice sounds better than ever . The song `` Sista Big Bones '' is an instant classic and immediately invoked old school Stevie Wonder memories in my heart . `` The Truth '' is a really great song too . There is no artist out there right now that is even coming close to the kind of soul music Anthony Hamilton is making . It 's a great album , every song . Do n't miss out on this one .	1
Anthony Hamilton is the TRUTH ! ! ! He epitomizes what a soul singer should sound like and what a soul album should sound like ; filled with passion , love , anger , hurt , wisdom and knowledge . This album is his third classic in a row ( following Comin From Where I 'm From and Soulife ) ; every song is a classic . This album is so relaxing and refreshing especially nowadays when it seems like everyone wants to be R Kelly . Hamilton 's lyrics are heartfelt and real , the production is very soulful , not too over the top it 's just right . The album flows along seamlessly without a hiccup to be found on the album . You can put this one on repeat and just let it play ... a soothing album definitely on the verge of greatness . Anthony Hamilton will be here making music for a long while and you should appreciate his talent while he 's still here making great music . 5 stars .	1
I love this CD , Ai n't Nobody Worryin ' . I try and listen to it whenever I can . It always puts me in a good mood to hear Hamilton 's soulful honesty . I have all of Anthony Hamilton 's CDs . I ca n't wait until he comes out with another one . This man sings with a lot of soul .	1
I fell in love with Anthony Hamilton 's voice the first time I heard the track `` COMIN FROM WHERE I 'M FROM '' and have been an avid fan ever since . It was sad to learn that this album did n't get any grammy love but like another reviewer stated , Anthony 's strong fan base show him plenty of love at his shows . This is a beautiful collection of soulful music that harkens back to old school artistry like Bill Withers , Curtis Mayfield & Marvin Gaye.I truly enjoy listening to the whole album and felt that the only misstep was the inclusion of the track entitled EVERYBODY . This track has a reggae-esque beat & while it 's not a bad song , it does seem a little out of place within what I consider a seamlessly soulful set.I ca n't recommend this album enough - it 's what good contemporary soul music should sound like !	1
I just recently discovered Anthony Hamilton 's music . It 's reminiscent of the old school classical R & B greats ; such as Al Green , Marvin Gay , Teddy Pendergrass , but at the same time is modernized with a touch of sounds similar to that of Luther , Babyface , Brian McKnight , Usher . It 's hard to find modern r & b artists that have that old school sound . This is great R & B that is authentic and soulful . I highly recommend Anthony Hamilton for anyone who likes R & B or music in general .	1
Anthony was a victim of the music business for the first eight years of his career . He got dropped from one label , then the next label he signed to went bankrupt , recorded two albums all in this time , one never saw the light of day ( and later became the Soulife album ) , and the other was called XTC and is pretty much none exisistent . Well now ten years later , after the then struggling musician , got signed to So So Def and released a decent album in `` Comin From Where Im From '' that gained him a strong fan base in 2003 , well now he is not doing to bad . He released a sort of compilation album earlier in 05 called `` Soulife '' that consisted of previously unreleased songs from his first two canned albums , and now in December of 2005 he released the stunning soulful `` Ai n't Nobody Worryin '' and now he cemented himself as a superstar . While he still isnt selling records in mass amounts , he now has a strong fan base . The thing i love about Anthony is that not only does he have the most gritty but yet smooth and soulful voice , he remains humble . He is unaffected by his recent fame that he has gained , he is still a country boy . And he is pround of it as you can tell after one listen to this album . Weather its the warm and summery breeziness of `` Southern Stuff '' or its the good old ghetto feel to `` Sista Big Bones '' this man is definetly a country guy . His best matireal is when he is singing about love weather its lost or gained . Like on the first single `` Ca n't Let Go '' , it has that brassy thumping mid tempo clash feel to it that is similar to `` Charlene '' . Or on the tear jerking and yet so- or in his case soul calming `` Never Love Again '' with its light piano touches . Either way , Anthony wont have to struggle no more after this legendary release , he won me over with his soulfulness.Grade : A-	1
With this CD being Protected is not Anthony 's fault . This is a wonderful CD . It is very soulful and hit todays life on the head . The title cut tells it all . A Must have CD .	1
OMG ! ! ! Anthony Hamilton has so much soul , he moves you with his music . The lyrics are just so meaningful . He is not just singing the songs because someone wrote them and told him . You can really feel what he is singing about . If you do n't have this Cd you most go out and get it . It 's the Truth ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
Anthony is like a fine wine he only gets better with time . This album is phenomenal . Anthony is in my opinion the definition of a true artist , you can listen to any of his works and tell he loves what he does and it shows . This album is exceptionally soulful and brilliant . Hamilton is certainly leading the way.D'Angelo , Badu , Maxwell , Scott , Arie ... .have carried the torch and can easily pass it over to Hamilton . I am amazed at how he was able to follow up his debut with a collection of songs as equally soulful and rousing as the first ! That is to be commended . This album is reminiscent of so many greats . Clearly you can hear the storytelling of a Bill Withers ( Preacher 's Daughter ) the moans of Al Green , the wails of Bobby Womack , the pain of a Donny Hathaway . Do I hear Prince influences as well ? The bass , the horns and organs and guitar licks of the music I grew up listening to as a child.Amazing production and arrangement , not to mention Hamilton 's great songwriting . Seriously listen to the lyrics . The man knows pain . The man knows love . Tracks 10 ( Change Your World ) , 11 ( Never Love Again ) and 12 ( I Know What Love 's All About ) ( which is very reminiscent of D'Angelo 's `` Higher '' cut on the Brown Sugar album ) are the stand-out tracks on this album . Pure , heartfelt , black folk 's down-home soul music ! ! ! I purchased this album a week ago . Listened to the whole thing on my way home , got home and absorb the beautiful soul of this music ! I am in love with this album . And God bless Anthony Hamilton for singing about something other than being trapped in a closet or feeling on someones booty ! ! ! ! This is real grown folk 's music ! ! ! I 'm not too fond of Preacher 's Daughter or Sista Big Bones , preferring his more soulful and slower tempo 's grooves.Thank you for giving your fans back the soul of Withers , Green , Womack , Hathaway , Gaye and so many other greats - with an urban , twist to it ! Much Love .	1
Every now and then an artist comes out of nowhere to impress you with a music release that is far beyond expectations . Anthony Hamilton 's `` Comin ' From Where I 'm From '' was definitely an example of this . Before hearing the CD , the only time that I had heard Anthony Hamilton was when he was singing hooks for Nappy Roots , Xzibit , etc . The only r & b ; track that I had heard him on was a song that was on Sunshine Anderson 's CD entitled `` Last Night '' . That track also featured Dolo Pichino . When I first heard the title track , `` Comin From Where I 'm From '' , I was impressed because after only hearing Anthony Hamilton on rap hooks , I did n't know that a solo song from him would sound so good . Once the CD was released I was hooked . While most people heard the title track and `` Charlene '' since those were the songs that were released , the best material ended up being other tracks on the CD such as `` Mama Knew Love '' where Jermaine Dupri took the beat that Jay Z used for `` Blueprint ( Momma Loves Me ) '' and Anthony Hamilton definitely took care of the rest with the vocals , `` Since I See n't You '' , which is still my favorite song from the CD , where Anthony crafts the perfect midtempo song with help from Mark Batson and Maya Jones and `` Cornbread , Fish & Collard Greens '' where Anthony takes a nice feel good uptempo track and blends everything with the rest of the CD.Earlier this year , Rhino released a CD of earlier material from Anthony Hamilton entitled `` Soullife '' . However , this CD is n't actually Anthony Hamilton 's second CD . Do n't let this fool you though , because there is some nice material on this CD . My favorite track by far is `` I Used To Love Someone '' .Anthony Hamilton 's second CD is entitled `` Ai n't Nobody Worryin ' '' . Although , this CD was just released on December 13th , I can tell you already that this disc is a certified classic . `` Ai n't Nobody Worryin ' '' is a CD that will be in rotation for years to come . It 's released in December 2005 , but the material definitely has an old school r & b ; feel to it . The 1st single , `` Ca n't Let Go '' is a clear indication of what you should expect on the CD . What I do n't understand though is that for some reason there are some people that are n't really feelin ' this track . Ladies and gentlemen , I do n't know if you can get any better than this when it comes to r & b ; music with an old school soul sound to it . `` Ca n't Let Go '' is classic Anthony Hamilton as he understands that in a relationship there are going to be ups and downs , but the ultimate reality is that since I care about you so much , that no matter what happens we are going to be together and I `` Ca n't Let Go '' . The CD starts off differently though as Anthony tries to backtrack and wonder `` Where Did It Go Wrong ? '' Throughout the track he tries to go through all the details to figure out where things started to go bad in his past . What he is trying to understand is why he still wants to be with someone that has put him through things and if he can still depend on this person in the future . `` Southern Stuff '' ends up being a nice feel good jam just like `` Cornbread , Fish & Collard Greens '' was on `` Comin ' From Where I 'm From '' . However , the southern `` stuff '' that Anthony is referring to can be translated to mean many things . The title track is a nice track because Anthony takes a break from the old school r & b ; to remind people that through everything that there are still basic everyday problems that are still going on in the world that we ca n't afford to continue to ignore . In essence , he is saying that the majority of the world is just worrying about what 's going on in their lives intead of having a broader scope about what 's going on in the world and in surroundings other than their own . Raphael Saadiq produces a nice track for Anthony Hamilton to talk about what 's going on in the world today . Vidal & Dre produce a nice midtempo jam in `` The Truth '' where Anthony tells the woman that he is involved to just trust in him and what they are trying to build instead of concentrating on past events . `` Preacher 's Daughter '' sounds like a 70s track that may have been on the Superfly soundtrack as Anthony is quick to remind us that you ca n't judge a book by its cover . Just because someone may appear to be something , in the end they can be just as bad as anyone else . In this case , it just happens to be the preacher 's daughter . `` Pass Me Over '' definitely has a gospel feel to it . I hate to compare anything that Anthony Hamilton does to Mariah Carey but just as Mariah did with `` Fly Like A Bird '' , Anthony Hamilton shows that he can be versatile with his music and have a gospel feel to his music as well . This may be a prelude to an Anthony Hamilton gospel CD , who knows . After hearing alot of old school soul , `` Everybody '' may throw alot of people off . All of a sudden , Anthony breaks into a reggae groove after what is basically a gospel song . I admire Anthony 's versatility so I do n't have a problem with this track but some people will . After producing `` Ai n't Nobody Worryin '' 's first three tracks , Mark Batson shows up again with `` Sista Big Bones '' . Now this track is pretty good and I can feel the subject material because he is basically saying that he can deal with `` thick '' women just like he can deal with any other type of woman , but compared to the rest of the tracks on this CD , `` Sista Big Bones '' just does n't live up to the rest of the classics on this CD , in my opinion.However , in one track that changes drastically as James Poyser and Questlove from The Roots help Anthony Hamilton create another masterpiece in `` Change Your World '' . When r & b ; music was created to make love songs , this song would definitely classify to be a blueprint for that . If you like slow jams that talk about love this song will turn out to be one of your favorites in the year 2006 and for years to come . This song is my favorite track from the CD so far . Kevin Wooten , who produced `` Pass Me Over '' helps Anthony create another great slow jam in `` Never Love Again '' . Unlike `` Where Did It Go Wrong '' , where Anthony still wants to make a gallant effort to make things work , this track analyzes all the bad things that happened in this particular relationship and why he would never want to fall in love again . Any man will be able to relate to this track . Kevin Wooten shows up again to end things with `` I Know What Love 's All About '' . As one reviewer said , this track really has an Al Green feel to it . Anthony talks about the trials and tribulations in a relationsip which means in essence , he knows what love is really about.If anyone thought that Anthony Hamilton would suffer from the sophomore jinx , they will be sadly mistakened . This CD will end up being a classic in the long run . If anyone has any doubts about Anthony Hamilton 's 2nd disc , I 'm hear to erase those doubts right now . If you enjoyed `` Comin ' From Where I 'm From '' and `` Soullife '' , you will DEFINITELY enjoy `` Ai n't Nobody Worryin ' '' . You can not afford to pass up on this CD.Trust me on that one.James ' Top 51 ) Change Your World2 ) Never Love Again3 ) Ca n't Let Go4 ) Southern Stuff5 ) Ai n't Nobody Worryin '	1
This album is a golden disc that simueltaneously soothes the soul , impresses the mind with gift , and gives it nutrition with the social and spirtual lyrical tones.Musically -- - he seamlessly carries his signature soul fashion straight into genres like gospel and reggae for moments that are thoroughly heartfelt , enjoyed , and seamless.A beautifully produced and played album . Pure organic soul music.Keep it coming , Anthony !	1
'Comin from where I 'm from ' & 'Soulife ' were both off tha hook albums . This album is good & does get stronger after each listen , but there are no absolute stand-out songs as in his other albums . Overall though , it is a must have . Title song 'Ai n't Nobody Worry'n ' is the tighest .	1
I expect nothing but the best fom Anthony Hamilton and he did not disappoint me with this new cd . Do n't skip one track on ths cd . This is a listen `` all the way thru '' album ... He released this in the nick of time . I wish he go tap D'Angelo on the shoulder and tell him to get his behind back into the studio .	1
Words can not describe how TALENTED this artist is . When he sings you will feel what he saying . I have all of his music and as with the rest this one is EXCELLENT ! ! ! ! The way he can make his voice change is so beautiful . I have young kids and they try so hard to sing like him when I play Anthony 's music . He is pure TALENT ! One of the best artist hands down ! ! ! ! I wish him all the best and cant wait until his next album drops !	1
With the release of his follow-up to the phenomenal COMIN ' FROM WHERE I 'M FROM , Hamilton releases the consistent AI N'T NOBODY WORRYIN ' . It is hard to make an album that is just as good as your first release , yet Hamilton does it here with flying colors presenting a soulful journey that no true R & B ; fan can miss . In fact , Hamilton has made easily one of 2005 's best and most credible R & B ; albums without having to conform to the contemporary R & B ; standards of today . With this soulful masterpiece , Hamilton evokes what everyone loves about soul including the soulful drum grooves and the raw emotion of the lyrics . Through Anthony Hamilton , you can hear the influences of greats like Bill Withers and Teddy Pendergrass , just to mention a few.Production is among the best that I 've heard in any R & B ; album in 2005 . Throughout the album , Hamilton keeps the soulful formula with wailing earthy organs , soulful sharp guitars , warm electric keyboards , Al Green reminiscent horns and horn synths , and acoustic piano . While it would not be fair to call Hamilton a hip-hop artist , the drum programming that hinges the arrangement is both soulful enough for the older fans and hip-hop enough for young followers of Hamilton who embrace the sanctity of Hamilton 's music . Furthermore , besides the brilliant production work , there is no filler material whatsoever on this album ; everything is just as good as everything else ( relatively speaking of course ) just as Hamilton 's Grammy nominated COMIN ' FROM WHERE I 'M FROM was . With that said , my favorites from this spectacular album are : `` Where Did It Go Wrong '' , `` Southern Stuff '' , `` Ca n't Let Go '' ( which is a 5/5 for me ) , `` Ai n't Nobody Worryin ' '' , `` Change Your World '' , `` Never Love Again '' , and `` I Know What Love 's About '' . While I love those tracks , I think that EVERY track on this album is well deserving of accolades . With that said , GRAMMY 2007 , watch out ! ! !	1
Anthony Hamilton-Ai n't Nobody Worryin ' One Word EXCELLENT one of the best cd 's this year ... .just listen to `` Southern Stuff '' `` Sister Big Bones '' `` The Truth '' `` Change Your World '' and you will know ai n't nobody was ever worried that Anthony would have any problems following up his superb debut cd ... Support this artist so he can continue making great Soul music .	1
the disc is not coprighted ! YEAH ! The music , lyrics , production are amazing . He deserves so much more than he gets . Please support this artist so he can continue to make beautiful music ! I love `` I know what love is all about '' so beautiful ! Anthony has continuously realeased `` way '' above par albums and being a music lover I have nothing but appreciation for that .	1
Anthony Hamilton has proved that there was never any need for worryin ' where the quality of his music was concerned . I have to admit I had my fears . Fears of guest rappers , fears of duets with `` radio friendly '' and photogenic female singers of the moment and fears of predictably shallow lyrics set to `` banging '' beats . But my fears were groundless and Hamilton has given us another solid set of southern soul songs . This is the real deal right here , straightforward with no gimmicks . As Dizzy Gillespie once famously said ( at least I think it was him ) : `` This is how music should sound ! `` He may never be a darling of the MTV/TRL crowd ( which is probably why I have n't yet seen any promo video for any song off this CD ) but I think he knows he does n't need them . Despite what greedy suits and pessimistic bean counters might think , I truly believe there will always be a solid fan base for this kind of music . This guy is turning out instant classics and where some male vocalists will be forgotten in five to ten years time , I see people picking up Hamilton 's stuff in 20 years time plus , in much the same way people are still picking up stuff from the seventies by people like Stevie Wonder , Marvin Gaye and Donny Hathaway today.It took a few listens of this CD for any particular tracks to grab me ( not necessarily a bad thing ) but songs like `` Preacher 's Daughter '' , `` Sista Big Bones '' and `` Change Your World '' have now grown on me and warm my heart now every time I hear them.If only more brothers would do it the way Anthony Hamilton does it . There could be future hope for black music yet .	1
Anothony Has A Wonderful Voice & Hes Strikes Me As Being A Real True Southern Gentleman ... This CD is A Winner ... I Like `` Coming From Where Am From Just As Much As I Enjoy This One..	1
`` Ai n't Nobody Worryin '' , is Music for Music 's sake . This C.D is full of the raw emotion that has been currently lacking in the R & B world . I wont get into the name game on whether Hamilton is soul , neo-soul , southern soul etc . What hamilton is is good , adult music . He is not weighed down by over production nor does he have a rapper guest starring on the record . By the way since when did Rap become R & B music ? ! . I think that if you are the type of person that enjoys good sophisticated music , then there is a place for Anthony Hamilton in your collection . Do n't get me wrong , I like all types of music but This CD just reminds me of what music used to and should still sound like .	1
I did n't care for this album as much as the first one I bought , at first . After I listened to it the second time , I found that I really liked it.Anthony has stuck to his storytelling style and I like it a lot . My favorite songs on here are `` Pass Me Over '' and `` Southern Stuff '' .I would definitely recommend this album to people who like southern style music .	1
R & B ; has really fallen as a genre in recent years with most artists trying to hard to reach the hip-hop audience by singing over beats that should be reserved for rap songs . This had led to a shrinking amount of artist who sings over smooth soul grooves like All Green and Donnie Hathaway did in the heyday of the genre . Yeah today we have Alicia Keys and John Legend , but that 's about it . Another guy that can be added to that list is Anthony Hamilton who , even though he may be best known for singing hooks for rappers like Nappy Roots and Jadakiss , has recently arrived to help keep soul music alive.Hamilton 's latest album , Ai n't Nobody Worryin ' focuses on all the tried and true soul theme of love whether it lost love ( Where Did It Go Wrong ? ) , trying to hold on love ( Ca n't Let Go ) , and right in the middle of love ( Truth ) as well as the general I Know What Love 's All About . And singing the hook on Jadakiss ' Why stirred some political awareness too in the vein of Marvin Gaye with songs like the title track ( How the children gon na learn when they got ta take turns cause they ai n't got books to read ) and Preacher 's Daughter ( She had a habit that she could n't really stop , needed money so she had to hit the block ) which also features Tarsha McMillian who added some gravity to the already deep song.Pass Me Over is the best song here as it 's the total package . The song is a gospel like ode about waiting for your Savior and is highlighted by a space piano and crescendos at the end with a choir backing Hamilton up , in his best vocal performance on the album , then comes down and concludes in a beautiful instrumental as Hamilton tells us he will `` meet you on the other side . '' There are a few speed bumps on the way through the album including Southern Stuff that has too much of a heavy hip-hop beat and the almost reggae Everybody . But Hamilton 's voice does a good job at trying to save those songs .	1
Stronger than one or two of his other records , but you wonder what album he 'd have put out if he ( or his label , or both ) did n't feel he had to put out a record almost every year and gave him a chance to marinate on his catalogue a bit . Seriously : if you took the best 3-5 songs off of `` Soulife '' ( which came out about this time last year ) and put them with the best 3-5 songs on this record , he 'd have an unstoppable record . The first track is the best , `` Where Did It Go Wrong ? `` , and it 's just radio-friendly enough , so I ca n't for the life of me figure out why I 'm hearing `` Ca n't Let Go '' at every turn . Still , his style is singular and he 's as close as we 'll get to the `` B '' in R & B anymore .	1
Anthony Hamilton is the type of cat that makes you sit back , relax , close your eyes , and listen . I have not heard a song he does YET that I would n't replay . I 'm not even a big churchgoer and I 'd reply his gospel-like songs as quickly as I 'd play his Neo Soul/ R & B songs . `` Sista Big Bones '' is my jam , but every other cut on here is just as outstanding . I do n't even have any cons for this man ; just pros . Great job ! I saw him perform live at the Taste of Chicago and I wanted him to stay up there forever . You should 've saw the sad faces in the crowd when he ended his performance and how we all cheered when he came back out to do `` Brown Skin '' with India Arie . His voice is rich , his songs are excellent , his beats are perfect for his tone . I just love his music to death !	1
Anthony you did it again ! Words ca n't begin to express how awesome this album is . My favorites are : Southern StuffThe TruthChange Your WorldNever Love Again	1
Ok ... Anthony does it again , No surprise here . He is such a Consistent artist and thats something we can all appreciate , I am sure ! His style is very laid back and effortless . It just comes so natural , you can just feel the easiness of his voice.. the smoothness of the point he 's trying to get across ... The BEST tracks , in my option are `` The Truth '' , `` Change Your World '' , and `` Cant Let Go . '' but to be real , the entire cd is awesome , you can pop it in and let it play thru ... even the tracks you are n't in love with , make you tap your feet ... like it took me a min to give `` Sista Big Bones '' two thumbs up , but I did ... oh , and I must must add `` Southern Stuff ! ! '' to the top of the Favs ... that 's hot ... Basically , if u are a true R & B lover , buy this cd u should enjoy it.. He 's right up there with Raphael Saadiq because everything Anthony Hamilton puts out is `` Instant Vintage ! ! ! ! ! ! ''	1
Anthony Hamilton once again proves to be great . YOu will love this recording and play it over and over . Enjoy it	1
What a merry Xmas listening to this CD ! This album is great and soulfulI hope this album sells a lotAnthony will become a soul legend	1
Lets be honest , nobody is putting it down like Anthony Hamilton right now maybe John Legend and I am not even just focusing on his vocals which are awesome but his devotion to what he is singing resignates so clearly . The title song Ai n't Nobody Worrying says a mouth full , things have gotten so out of hand that no one seems to care . While that is a shame , it takes another kind of artist to express this so eloquently like a two sided coin . This CD is totally blueszy , funky , soul . Do n't sleep .	1
Anthony Hamilton presents really deep feel good music , reminiscent of a time gone by , even though some songs could be considered a little melancholy . Not as prolific as `` Comin from where I 'm from '' , but tracks ( 4 ) `` Ai n't nobody worryin '' , ( 5 ) `` The truth '' and the instant classic ( 7 ) `` Pass me over '' are very passionate songs . The reggae inspired ( 8 ) `` Everybody '' is a nice change of pace . The music world truly needs many more Anthony Hamiltons in the `` game '' .	1
This Cd was stuck in my player for a long time . The Artic Monkeys , as you should be aware through song samples and YouTube , play fast rock . You 've got one distorted guitar , and one clean guitar . The music is catchy , and yet deceptively simple . The singer paints a great picture of what it 's like to be a teenager in a British city . This is Joe Jackson 's `` Look Sharp '' updated , a classic disc .	1
I actually was n't exposed to any of the hype about Arctic Monkeys . In fact , when I found out that they were going to be on Saturday Night Live , I was like , `` Who the hell are they ? '' Well , the Sheffield foursome proved themselves and then some on their debut , Whatever People Say I Am , That 's What I 'm Not.Actually , some of the most interesting moments refer not to the album , but their SNL appearance . Take the irresistible single `` I Bet You Look Good On the Dancefloor '' , for example . On the album , lead singer Alex Turner says : `` Stop making the eyes at me/I 'm still making the eyes at you '' but on the show , he said `` Stop breaking the ties with me/I 'm still breaking the ties with you '' . It 's also interesting that before the final musical breakdown on `` A Certain Romance '' , Alex pointed out to the audience and said , `` That man just yawned . `` But neither of those things take away from the overall greatness of those respective songs , or of the album as a whole . It 's very hard to pick a favorite song out of the bunch , but `` Riot Van '' , a humorous story about underage drinking , easily comes to mind ( funny how the subject is acceptable when non-rappers talk about it , hmmm ? ) . All arguments aside , one also ca n't afford to pass up `` Red Light Indicates Doors Are Secured '' or especially `` Mardy Bum '' , because the infectious rhythms of both songs easily draw you in . The fifth track is also good , but I doubt it 'll be released as a single because I think very few people will call up their local radio station to request `` You Probably Could n't See For the Lights But You Were Staring Straight At Me '' .The only reason I did n't give the album five stars is because in the middle of the otherwise good `` Dancing Shoes '' , Alex says `` Get on your dancing shoes/You sexy little swine '' , which I doubt will turn any women on . I also do n't know if the Monkeys will be doing as much touring right now , considering their bassist quit . At any rate , you can call them indie rock , garage rock , or whatever you want , but pick up Arctic Monkeys ' album ad pop it into your stereo.Anthony Rupert	1
Okay , yeah , I know . Who really gives a sh-t about the Arctic Monkeys ? Oh , you mean besides the British press and the band 's thousands of friends on MySpace and every hipster in tight pants who is `` so over '' the Killers and Interpol and Franz Ferdinand ? I weas n't even going to review this . In fact I was prepared to hate it . A band with that much hype before they even have a record out can never be a good thing . British new music mag NME voted the Arctic Monkeys one of the 50 best British bands OF ALL TIME ! ! I 'd be afraid to see numbers 51 through 100 , the ones who were bumped to make room for a band who at the time had only released a single.But , and it 's a BIG BUT , this record is awesome . Really . It does pain me to admit it , but this is one of the best new records I 've heard in ages . Would n't go so far as top 50 British bands ever , but sh-t man , I ca n't stop listening to this . Seriously , every day.So what 's it sound like ? Well , it definitely fits comfortably right there amidst the Killers , Franz Ferdinand , Maximo Park , Kaiser Chiefs , and almost just like Hot Hot Heat for that brief moment when they were really really good . Not so much channelling 'new wave ' but more sort of reimagining the sound of the Fall , but where Pavement turned the Fall into ironic indie slouch rock jangle , the Arctic Monkeys twist it into some impossibly hooky dancey drunken night out at the pub.Angular guitars , sort of scrape-y and edgy and scrappy and jagged , super kinetic almost funky rhythms , killer melodies , bouncy tempos , lots of shuffle and start stop jangle and roar . And killer keening vocals , a little bit whine-y , but scruffy and capable of wailing when necessary . And the most amazingly thick Scottish brogue , ya know when the word `` scumbag '' sounds like `` skoooombeg '' .And let 's not forget the songs . By now most of you have heard the excellently titled `` I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor '' , a perfect blast of bubbly snotty bouncy dance punk . But then there 's tracks like `` When The Sun Goes Down '' with its moody sad boy intro all sweet sad vocals and minor key clean guitars that explode into a pounding kick a -- chaotic rocker , with a killer riff and a totally impossible to resist groove . And the thing is , every song on here is just as good . So while the band will probably end up disappearing , breaking up or calling it quits after this record , I mean , how impossible is it to live up to all the critical accolades ( imagine being held up alongside bands like the Clash and the Jam , all before the age of 20 ) but for now , you might as well believe the hype .	1
In high school `` Stroke You Up '' was the jam , so I went downtown and bought the cassette . Let me tell you something : It took me 2 days to listen to it because it was utterly boring . Even `` Stroke You Up '' became unbearable to listen to . No funk , no groove- just lukewarm soul . That was the first *and* the last time I listened to `` Changing Faces . '' The two chicks who made up `` Changing Faces '' had airy , monotonous vocals- no edge to their voices at all . Even the album cover looked boring . These chicks had no style or any type of pizzazz at all . Skip this at all costs and get Zhane .	-1
cOMEON- AN ALBUMthis GREAT-no one is going to read all the accurate 5 star reviews- would you ? me either . list the 8 great Debute albums and this will be listed on most . I wonder what universe this would not be considered great- not a universe I would want to be in . If you REALLY need to be convinced read all the 5 star reviews .	-1
I never understood what 's the BIG deal behind this album . Yes , the production is wonderfull but the songwriting is childish and rubbish . Brial Wilson definitly can not write great lyrics like Bob Dylan sometimes do . `` God Only Know '' and `` Wouldnt Be nice '' are indeed masterpieces ... but the rest of the album is background music..	-1
It 's now very well known that the labelling on this disc is deceptive - it was NOT taken from the original analog master tape , but from a second generation copy and DAT . Sonically , it is not bad , but not anywhere close to the earlier gold CD from the now defunct DCC . Not enough of an upgrade over the last Capitol remaster to be worthwhile .	-1
I am very disapointed ! After looking for this album for 10 years , at least I bought it and ... masterpiece ? C'mon people ! I have around 2000 Rock albums in my collection and I would never placed this not even between the top 100.How could anyone say that Rubber Soul or Revolver are under Pet Sounds ? Any 60 's Rolling Stone album is one hundred times better . And something else , if this is the sound that shape the American pop music , I might be wrong , but ... where is Jimi Hendrix , Muddy Waters , Miles Davis , etc ? Those are really masters of American music , not The Beach Boys.I ca n't give to this album more than half star .	-1
It is mind boggling all the hype surrounding this badly overrated CD . I like many of the Beach Boys big hits but this CD just does n't cut it . On the version I borrowed , out of sixteen songs only the four lead tracks-Would n't It Be Nice , Caroline No , God Only Knows , and Sloop John B are of high quality . I Know There 's An Answer , Here Today , and You Still Believe In Me are slightly captivating among the remaining songs . The problem here at least to my ears is that the songs all have a similar arrangement . Not slow and romantic like Surfer Girl or Warmth of The Sun or fast and jumpy like Fun Fun Fun and Surfin ' USA . Its all mid-paced and kind of spacey with a strong lack of ooomph and too many special effects.It boggles the mind how one television broadcast ranked this CD as the third greatest rock n roll album of all time . Geeze Louise , this album barely even rocks ! There is a strong lack of guitar presence throughout this collection and way too many special ef ! fects . It trudges along like a sluggish snail and you can hardly wait for it to end . The harmonies all sound the same after a while and Brian hogs most of the lead vocals . The lyrics may have some special meanings but that 's based on the fact that you have not fallen asleep listening to the music . How anyone can compare this to even the weakest of Beatles records is ludicrous.In my opinion , stick with a good compilation of the Beach Boys . California Girls , Help Me Rhonda , I Get Around , and other early hits will always remain classics and keep any party hopping . I have three of them and they all work fine . However , when Brian Wilson attempted to get too deep and stray away from grooving surfer rhythms , the result is a stony bore . Borrow it from a friend but save your money as this music just does not cut the mustard .	-1
I love the Beach Boys as much as anyone . Let me say that again . I love the BEACH Boys as much as anyone . By that I mean I love the Beach Boys who actually live up to their name , singing about the beach , girls , surfing , cars , and Rhonda.This is not the Beach Boys . It ca n't be . Why ? No beach songs ! I thought it was some kind of joke . All & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; offers is the opportunity to hear Brian Wilson whine for forty minutes , backed by elevator music . There 's barely any Mike Love on the album at all.Way overrated .	-1
If you like Alison , you 'll probably like this CD . I found a couple of songs I enjoyed . The rest I ignore ( I recorded the ones I liked on to another source ) . If you are not a big fan of hers , there are better samples of her work .	-1
This was on TV all the time to promote Carribean Queen as an 80s classic . I had never heard the song in its entirety , and it clocked in at just above 7 minutes long . Loverboy and Suddenly are also good songs , but not enough for me to rate it higher than a disappointment with the artist as a whole . This is another one of those Cds I found at Wal Mart for 5 bucks . I guess they 're still trying to make their money back from the first press . Did n't even include credits , and no lyrics in the package .	-1
Tear Down These Walls was Billy Ocean 's final run at chart success . The album features one of the most reviled songs from the 80 's , `` Get Outta My Dreams , Get Into My Car '' . It generally makes the list for worst songs from the 80 's , but it is a little harsh as the song has a fun , innocent charm that seems to be missing from most songs these days . It made its way to number one and it was the last time Mr . Ocean had a top ten single . He became a casualty of the grunge movement in the early 90 's as most 80 's stars who were perceived to be soft met up with a similar chart demise .	-1
As a child and young adult when I tended to believe that all `` alternative '' music was basically noisy , unlistenable grunge likeNirvanaorEverclearorThe Presidents Of The USA , the pop songs of my 1980s childhood occupied my attention because they were the most readily available alternative . I used to adore the big hits on `` Greatest Hits '' and said they were my favourite songs.Today , however , as an experienced music listener , it is very clear to me that the material here is awfully dated and shallow . The huge beats on `` When The Going Gets Tough '' , which was his only # 1 hit , and his second biggest hit `` Get Out Of My Dreams '' were really catchy and even enchanting to me as a child , but if I listen to them now in the library at Melbourne University they seem awfully dated . The same is true of the earlier `` Carribbean Queen '' , whilst `` License To Chill '' is even worse in this respect.The slower material , to which Billy 's `` big '' voice was never suited , comes off as even worse . I always thought `` Here 's To You '' and `` Loverboy '' were terribly soppy , and it 's easy to imagine how I would feel about them nowadays.This is something I want to note as something I have given up , and it is so dated with its big beat dance track and so soppy on the ballads that one should steer clear of it .	-1
this disc is okay but it does n't show the talent & amp ; depth of this man.from 76-82 he was grooving.then he came stateside and was watered down.this set hardly does the man justice.he is a very talented artist who deserves better .	-1
Should have been called disappointment , BDP is no PE . KRS1 's ` knowledge ' is really no more than Nation Of Islam rhetoric , not so cleverly put to music . KRS1 was always more ` preacher ' than ` teacher ' , inviting obedience rather than introspection . Here , in ` Ya Strugglin ' he adds homophobia to his cannon of hates .	-1
The commercial failure of KRS1s didactic venom is a tribute to the good taste of American rap fans . He has done better .	-1
Aaliyah is not much of a singer but she has a style about her in her delievery that makes her credible.i really liked Back & amp ; fourth.R.Kelly dominates all thru this disc.she has a certain it about her that Brandy , Monica , Myia , etcc.. do n't .	-1
I HATE E-40 , BUT THE TRACK WITH 2 PAC IS GOOD.THE 2 STARS ARE ONLY FOR THAT SONG.DO N'T BUY THIS JUNK TRUST ME .	-1
Before I get any hate mail , I would like to state for the record that I own a copy of this CD . I am not bashing this CD because I love *NSYNC . In fact , I do n't intend to truly be bashing this CD in anyway . These are just my feelings about this particular album.Now , here I go : This CD is awful ! The production alone merits this as a single star . The drums and background portions of the music drowned out the vocals.The vocals are somewhat okay . Most of the album is done through their noses and , being a musician myself , this drives me crazy . When it is n't done through their noses , they strain their vocal cords ... which makes it even worse ! And could Nick be any flatter on half of the notes ? The actual songs -- the music of the songs and the lyrics -- are n't that great . They 're full of grammatical errors . There are also some points when the harmonies do n't blend correctly.This CD sounds like it was thrown together in a matter of seconds and had no hard work or effort put into it . I strongly recommend that you avoid this CD .	-1
The Only Reason I gave this C.D a chance was because my Girlfriend Happens to love these Moronic disgraces of Music . 4 songs on this 12 song album were Decent ! the rest Were shoddy Production and too Poppy . & quot ; quit Playing Games with my heart & quot ; a great song has an rnB feel to it . & quot ; As long as you love me & quot ; Great Lyrics and the groove is catchy ! . & quot ; all i have to give & quot ; fairly decent i have to be in the mood to listen to it . & quot ; everybody & quot ; the only reason i like this damn song is because i saw the video so many times i have the lyrics imbedded in my brain . The rest suck . Im sorry But after Artist like & quot ; Prince & quot ; , & quot ; Stevie Wonder & quot ; , & quot ; Michael Jackson & quot ; Paved the way for these young swill Merchants . You think Anyone Would make good music . Well These Puppets for the record companies Suck no Punn intended . if you like this kind of music go listen to Savage Garden at least they have Talent . these morons do n't and Im out !	-1
It 's amazing how these guys keep fooling people . I ask you : do they write their songs ? Or some clever professional songwriter do that for them ? I have absolutely nothing against ballads and pop , but when that sounds a complete fake , that pisses me off !	-1
Talent-Less in every sense of the word.The music is Dated New Jack & amp ; The vocals are plain boring.all of their music is Formula.Avoid at all costs.just like all the other boy bands .	-1
I 'm not gon na say that I expected better of this album , because I seriously didn't.I knew this album was going to be the start of a horrible era ... the boyband era ALL OVER AGAIN ! I knew that this album was going to SUCK once I heard `` We Got It Goin ' On '' .But , I have to admit , I tried to be fair and like at least one song , but I just could n't ! Every song is so damn obnoxious and so manufactured , it 's almost as if you 're forced not to like them , unless of course you 're a girl in her teens willing to scream for any group with a little sex appeal.Sure , all the songs make you wan na kill yourself if you actually listen to GOOD music , but the most annoying are definitely `` Everybody ( Backstreets'Back ) ( back from where ? ) '' and the horrible vomit-worthy cover of `` Set Adrift On Memory Bliss '' .And the vocals : Lord save me now ! Nick Carter sounds like a deeper version of Alanis Morisette on crack ( sorry for insulting a music genius like you , Alanis ) ! I ca n't think of one good thing about this trash except that you actually like the songs for about 3 seconds until you come back to reality.Sure , they 're a manufactured boy band and that 's bad enough , but they could 've at least given a 2-star effort ! The Verdict : Why this sold so much is beyond me ! Recommended : I think you know my answer !	-1
Say what you will , but it 's patently unfair to say that the Backstreet Boys ` suck ' . Granted , those of us who have been raised on rock and roll will find it difficult to ascertain the musical appeal of five performers posing as a band , singing pseudo-soulless versions of pre-packaged pop emotional swill , but we are n't their target audience . These guys , or rather the people who have manipulated them into the image that they represent , have targeted them straight at the heart of pre-teen youth culture , and as such , they have done a better than admirable job . For those of us who might have selective memories , there have been other , MUCH worse examples of teen-based music that pre-dates the Backstreet Boys - Would anybody care to remember the Osmond Brothers ? Leif Garrett ? Fabian ? In comparison , the Backstreet Boys are downright respectable . While music by the aforementioned has been thoroughly forgotten , I think that the Backstreet Boys have done their job well enough to survive the ravages of time . So , for all the naysayers who dismiss the Backstreet Boys as irrelevant , I 'll try not to say I told you so when you find yourself humming along nostalgically to `` Quit Playing Games With My Heart '' in another five years , or `` As Long as You Love Me '' .

I Got Next is probably the last album from KRS-One that anyone owns ( although I 'm not sure if anyone will admit they own this ) . I listened to this album when I first bought it in '97 , and I did n't really think it was all that ... a shocker because KRS usually comes correct . But then I listened to it again and ... well , I did n't realize just how bad it was.When artists release classic albums at the beginning of their career and then some of their following albums do n't even come close ( and they usually do n't ) , people say that 's an unfair comparison because they ca n't be expected to live in the past , or , `` How can you compare this to THAT ? '' ( Check comparing any Nas album , or ANY album , to Illmatic . ) But after hearing this album , you 'll REALLY wish Kris stuck to his old style . There are many interludes where Kris is preaching , and they just do n't seem to fit . And the only real saving graces on this album are `` Heartbeat '' ( with Angie Martinez and Redman , who once again steals the show ) , `` The MC '' , and `` Step Into A World '' , even though the latter 's music is slightly irritating.The rest of the album is a downer . The production AND rapping are surprisingly bad . And I 'm not saying the rapping is bad because he stopped swearing , because his last album was all right ( remember `` MC 's Act Like They Do n't Know '' ? ) ; here , it 's hard to tell if he even tried . `` Blowe '' has a very unnecessary and incomprehensible skit at the beginning , and the music sounds like the batteries in somebody 's walkman suddenly went dead . KRS 's rapping is tired here , and even Redman comes off wack . It 's hard to tell if the title track is a rap or a low-budget movie , and you 'd be slapped silly if you were caught singing along to `` H.I.P.H.O.P . '' or `` The Real Hip-Hop Part II '' ( what great titles , huh ? ) .When Kris does come through on the lyrics , the tracks are ruined by the sleepy production , especially in `` A Friend '' ( when it was released , everyone pretended to like it ) and `` Over Ya Head '' ( the trumpet does n't fit and you almost expect KRS to start singing ) . But the two last tracks are the worst . `` Just To Prove A Point '' is mixing rap and rock . That 's commonplace NOW , but back then it did n't sound right , and it especially does n't sound right for HIM to be screaming like a rock star . He 's not even on any kind of beat . The final track is a remix of `` Step Into A World '' featuring Puff Daddy . Puff is being his typical wack self , but it also rubs off on KRS . And what 's KRS-One doing with Puff Daddy anyway ? Overall , this album is worse than I remembered it . I still kept in mind what year this album was made before I wrote this review , but like I said before , I did n't like it back then either . I hoped KRS would redeem himself with subsequent albums , but according to reviews , those albums are n't great either , and record sales show that they 're just collecting dust anyway . Wherever the real KRS-One is hiding , I wish he 'd come out .	-1
P. diddy should 've never be in a krs record i kinda felt like krs was tryin to sell out wit diz album ... Good tracks `` the mc '' & `` a friend '' krs even did a rock track ... Skip diz and get all his other albums .	-1
The best album ever , PLEASE , this album is not even close to being good . Of the 17 songs on here , 2 are good , about 6 are ok , and the rest are just plain bad . My least favorite No Limit cd of the 15 or so I have ( clkose with Snoop 's `` Da Game Is to Be Sold ... '' album ) . Not even the No Limit guests ( which oddly there are n't nearly as many as any other release ) can bring this up to even an ok album . Yeah Mr. Puzzleface can rap fast but that do n't make him good . His flow is way off beat and he ca n't rap either , and the sad part is this is his best cd . Production is decent , but not as good as Beats by the Pound crew usually is ( the wack rapper on the mic is probably the main reason ) . Craig B does 6 songs , KLC does 5 , O'Dell does 2 , and Rick Rock , DJ Darryl , Studio Ton , and Legendary Traxster all do 1 . So when he asks -- Did I Do It ? I answer yes , you made a horrible cd . Unless for some odd reason you 're one of the bunch of idiots who like him or comemrcial down south music save you money and ear drums on this one. # 1 - 8 ( f/ Master P , Silkk the Shocker , Fiend , Mac ) # 2 - 7 ( about his murdered sister ) # 3 - 6 # 4 - 6 # 5 - 7 ( f/ Silkk the Shocker ) # 6 - 5 ( f/ master P & Silkk the Shocker ) # 7 - 4 # 8 - 5 ( f/ E-40 , B-Legit , Master P ) # 9 - 4 ( f/ Mia X ) # 10 - 7.5 # 11 - 6.5 # 12 - 8.5 ( nice beat ) # 13 - 6 # 14 - 4.5 ( f/ O'Dell ) # 15 - 7 ( nice beat ) # 16 - 5.5 ( f/ Snoop Dogg & Master P ) # 17 - 7 ( deeper song ) Michael Tyler -- New Orleans , LAcheck all my reviews	-1
this was my least favorite 2pac album . that doesnt mean it wasnt good . it was . but i thought it was a dissappointment . some of the songs were pretty whack . there were a lot of songs that i really liked . disc 1 contained most of the good songs like open fire , r u still down , where do we go from here , ... i wonder if heaven got a ghetto , nothng 2 lose , and my favorite on disc 1 hellrazor . that song was deep and real . disc 2 songs were pretty bad with the exception of i wonder if heaven got a ghetto remix , when i get free II , ... enemies with me , ready 4 whatever and my favorite only fear of death . i think i would have been better if 2pac hadnt of changed his voice like that . when i first bought it i listened to it for about a week then i went back listening to other 2pac cds . overall i think afeni shakur did a poor job producing the album . i think if suge knight had produced it with her it would have been A LOT better.by 2pacs # 1 fan	-1
Finally Tupac Shakur has came down from cloud 9 , only this has happened after Tupac Shakur has actually visited cloud 9 ( Heaven ) . This double LP sounds more like a compilation of 2Pac 's early work , most tracks were made around the times of `` 2Pacalypse Now '' and `` Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z ... '' , and it shows . Although Tupac ( as always ) comes with it lyrically ( for the most part ) , this album - like his old albums , suffers from poor production . But this LP is still a solid buy , it is just below average overall as an LP . Records like `` Do 4 Me '' and `` I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto ( remix ) '' , alone are an overwhleming excuse to buy this album .	-1
Well this is not quite the best Tupac album ever . Im not saying its bad im just saying compared to albums he has put out in the past for example & # 65533 ; All eyez on me & # 65533 ; and & # 65533 ; Me against the world & # 65533 ; this album is not as good.Ru still down features two disks but one must say that if they had just added the best songs onto one disk this album would have been better.For me standout tracks on this album are first off from disk 1 , Open fire , the title track R U Still Down ( remember me ) , I wonder if heaven got a ghetto and to be honest I can only pick out one good song from disk 2 which is Do For Love.Its not really a good example of what Tupac was really about . The beats are lame at times and don & # 65533 ; t really appreciate Tupac & # 65533 ; s lyrical capabilities . Saying that this album is way better than some albums other artists have been releasing and one the reasons I am a bit disappointed with this album is because of the quality of past projects . It really does give you the idea that someone has just put these songs together and hope they will please fans because Tupac is singing it.If someone picked up this album and had not heard of Tupac before this moment they wouldn & # 65533 ; t think much of it and it would be left picking up dust.If you really love Tupac you should get this album but personally if I were you I would try to find someone that has it and just borrow it off them for a few days . A bit disappointing .	-1
This band is truly terrible . First off , the music is terrible . It 's soft and wimpy and lacks any musical credibility . I 'm not just saying this because I hate punk . I do n't see how anyone can like this . The singer ( or singers ) have no excuse to BE singing . Do n't believe me ? Check out & quot ; Daddy Was a Rich Man & quot ; . Or pretty much any of their songs . The lyrics are so ridiculous . I appreciate anti-political manifesto very much . The reason they are ridiculous is because they could n't have made it more obvious that they do n't know what they 're talking about . All they do is whine . What 's the matter , guys ? Did n't mommy and daddy give you whatever you wanted ? They would n't let you take the car out last night ? What a joke ! As is all punk rock with the exception of a select few who decide to rise above the punk cliche . You want angry music with actual TALENT ? Listen to metal .	-1
Punk has had a long and proud tradition of being involved in left-wing radical politics . However , the best punk bands were n't just about the preachy lyrics ; they combined the polemics with a distinctive and memorable sound . Joe Strummer of The Clash knew this , as did Jello Biafra ( Dead Kennedys ) and D. Boon and Mike Watt ( Minutemen ) .Anti-Flag apparently does n't realize this . These guys hang their hat on their & quot ; radical & quot ; lyrics and not much else . Note that MANY punk and metal bands prior to Anti-Flag were spewing similar political invective with far more wit , flair , and intelligence than this band 's ham-handed , juvenile anthems . It does n't help Anti-Flag 's case that they frequently approach open hypocrisy . Case in point : Anti-Flag claim to be anti-violence . Riiiight . With songs titled & quot ; Kill The Rich , & quot ; how am I supposed to take this swill seriously ? Moreover , the music is just godawful . Yes , I realize punk is supposed to be amateurish , but this is plain terrible , not to mention about as & quot ; edgy & quot ; as a teddy bear . I 've heard junior high school NOFX ripoffs play better than this . Anti-Flag apparently has two singers , but both suck equally , and the band sounds about as instrumentally proficient as I am ( not very ) .In summary , Anti-Flag is another batch of inept fashion & quot ; punks & quot ; regurgitating the same ol ' protests and trying to pass them off as & quot ; rebellious. & quot ; Sorry , I 'm not falling for it . Spend your lawn-mowing money wisely kids , and pick up records by The Clash , Dead Kennedys , Black Flag , Bad Brains , Minutemen , Wire , MC5 etc . Your listening will be all the better for it .	-1
I know this guy is supposed to be some kind of saint , but this CD left me cold . If Drake ca n't be bothered to show a little emotion on this , he should n't have bothered to record it .	-1
This guy got passed me back in the day , even though I basically bought every album that came out back in the 60s and 70s . I was listening to sattelite radio and heard a cut from this one and I liked the moodish thing going on and the hint of drug influence in there somewhere , so I checked out a few websites on Nick Drake . His tragic story kind of hooked me so I bought this CD . Quite frankly I find this to be interesting , but not something I would recomend to everybody . The mood of depression stays so heavy that every song sounds the same and makes me feel like I am watching one of those pulse readouts in a hospital room , and it is a flatliner . I suppose that some people dig this mellowed out sort of `` I wan na leave this world stuff '' but I get enough of it quick . Drake 's guitar work was a bit unique in it 's time , but as many times as I try , I just ca n't quite get with this program . It is good to listen to and then take a nap .	-1
I am a huge fan of Nick Drake but this is my least favorite of his albums and I have rarely listened to it since getting it ten years ago . In fact , I 'm glad this was n't the first disc of his that I purchased or I probably would n't have bought any of his other albums . This album is way too overproduced . The best example is `` At The Chime of a City Clock '' which starts out strong but is overwhelmed by the riffing saxaphone after each line sung by Nick Drake from the second verse on . The first time I heard `` Hazey Jane II '' I could n't believe it was Nick Drake it was so downright cheesy and dated . The instrumentals on this disc border on easy listening also , which ai n't my style . The only songs worth hearing are `` Northern Sky '' ( one of the most beautiful songs I 've ever heard ) and `` Fly '' , although I prefer the home version he recorded at Tanworth in Arden in 1969 to the studio version . It 's interesting that John Cale was a guest on this album , but the results overall were subpar compared to the rest of Nick Drake 's recorded work . I do n't think it 's a coincidence that Nick Drake 's follow up to `` Bryter Layter '' was the extremely sparse `` Pink Moon '' album . I think it was a direct reaction to the overproduction that weakened his songs on `` Bryter Layter '' . `` Pink Moon '' benefits from the setting of just Nick Drake and his guitar , while the songs here are marred and dated by the arrangements . I do n't understand why anyone would rate this as Nick Drake 's best work . While I would n't hesitate to recommend Nick Drake 's music to anyone , I would n't recommend starting here . Try `` Five Leaves Left '' or `` Pink Moon '' first .	-1
Apparently , a lot of modern young musicians have looked to Nick Drake for inspiration . That sense of despair , that sense of loneliness , irrelevance , that kind of thing ... Maybe that 's one reason why they walk around like tramps , loud-mouthed and stupid . The search for individuality has surely drifted into the hands of ignorant swine.By Pink Moon stage , Nick Drake had drifted into isolation and heavy depression . But the sound of Pink Moon is not crushingly depressing nor is it tediously claustrophobic.The album has an overall quality of sound . Some bits are higher tempo and , so , more uplifting . The instrument playing is precise , like Drake 's voice , carrying the listener over desolate hills and stillwater beaches . I ca n't really pick out the highlights because it 's like taking the chicks away from the mother hen.Pink Moon is worth more than a listen . It deserves to be thought of as a beautiful , melancholic , classic on anybody 's list .	-1
This album had such a reputation that I could not miss it . What I must say , this is not for people who enjoy bubblegum hummable top 40 tunes ; or most other people I 'm sad to say . The songs are tuneless , melancholic droning without any distinct structure . Pink Moon is the only redeemable track . Nick Drake the 'tortured ' genius the legend has become intertwine with his music so that its not his talent alone , but the sad story of his premature death which has carried this decidedly mediocre record.If you 're into depressing music then Elliott Smith offers much more listenable fare . At least his songs have beautiful melody , harmonies , instrumentals.etc .	-1
I go waaaaay back with Bruce , back when his albums were all hard-to-find imports . I stopped buying him after the disappointment of BIG CIRCUMSTANCE ... and NOTHING BUT ... and DART TO THE HEART . Seems like he was still writing great music but I was n't connecting with it.So I 'm catching up and re-listening to everything after WORLD OF WONDERS . And realize I 'm not missing much . As always , his lyrics are exceptional but this is a dreary , monotone album where he & # 34 ; speak sings & # 34 ; pretty much throughout . & # 34 ; Pacing the Cage & # 34 ; is the & # 34 ; old Bruce & # 34 ; and a great , great song.The rest lacks hooks , melodies or refrains . Best to sit back and slip on the headphones and listen to his stories . You wo n't sing along but at least you 're listening to an artist . Not at all at the top of his game though .	-1
& quot ; Why Do n't You Love Me ( Like You Used to Do ? ) & quot ; and & quot ; How Much I 've Lied & quot ; -- the tunes that open and close this collection , respectively -- are bold , affecting interpretations ; but the ones that come between them are misguided , poorly performed horrors . The whole thing 's like bad sandwhich : tasty bread , but the middle 's just junk food ... .	-1
This record was probably the beginning of the end for Costello the conflicted song conqueror . Apparantly his television duet with George Jones ( the b-side Stranger in the House ) pumped a bit too much Nashville into his veins . The songs on this album , which have worked for countless other American singers , do n't gel with Costello 's voice or his band The Attractions ' style . Add hack production from country veteran Billy Sherrill and this compilation ends up completely disasterous . It 's a pity , because Costello was coming off such a huge record with & quot ; Imperial Bedroom & quot ; only to release this mess . Perhaps if Elvis had used a country band ala Clover ( from My Aim is True ) there 's a chance he may have been more insprired . But Englishmen simply can not & quot ; do & quot ; country , not even the gifted Declan MacManus . Besides , if he wanted to release a C & amp ; W record , he would have been better off using the excellent & quot ; King of America & quot ; to support this desire . That album , which featured Americans James Burton and Ron Tutt , contained all original material and displayed the flair and performance Costello seemingly always strives for . The & quot ; Almost Blue & quot ; outing is a muddy and boring mess . The reason I say this is Costello , when covering a tune , usually matches or betters the performance of the original artist . In each of these examples , he falls miserably short . Poorly planned and poorly executed , & quot ; Almost Blue & quot ; may serve as an adequate primer for the unsophisticated new wave listener unfamiliar with country , but for those who have heard the originals , it 's pretty painful . I think even Elvis Costello would have to agree with that assessment .	-1
I do n't know . I loved EC and I loved country ... I even went to see him on the tour afterwards ... what a waste of my precious time back then ... and of my money . This is self-indulgent and badls played ... I do not understand the point really . Buy some real country instead ... George Jones , Johnny Cash , anything instead ...	-1
I love country music -- the real stuff -- the kind Elvis attempts here . I also love Elvis Costello ; for the past week , I have listened incessantly to his collaboration with Burt Bacharach , `` Painted From Memory . `` *So with that as a perspective , I have to say that this may be the weakest effort in the entire Elvis catalog . Getting Billy Sherrill in Nashville surely was the right thing to do , but these songs do n't click , and about none of these covers can stand along side the original . I ca n't specifically carp about the playing or the vocals , but where they fail is in capturing the heart , the spirit , the feel of country music . They sound too much like an experiment . Years later , Van Morrison , another giant , would fail in a similar effort . *For sure , this is not a `` bad '' album , but there are 20 better collections that Elvis has recorded and thousands of better country albums .	-1
It probably seemed like a good idea in retrospect . Elvis wanted to go to Nashville and meet with an icon of a country classic producer , then cut an album of some of his favorites right there in music city . And after cutting some of excellent singles in a country format ( `` Radio Sweetheart '' being one ) , `` Almost Blue '' really could have been a great record.Instead , it was Elvis ' first big misstep of his stellar career . He failed to understand the hack mentality of the Nashville scene , and `` Almost Blue '' is the sound of a 9 to 5 producer ( Billy Sherrill ) trying to shoehorn a band of randy brits into a paint by numbers sound . While the album kicks off like it should ( `` Why Do n't You Love Me Like You Used To ? `` ) , the ensuing album finds the band in a straightjacket . The sole exceptions , naturally , were the ballads . ( `` Good Year for The Roses , '' `` Brown to Blue '' and `` How Much I Lied . '' ) The rest of `` Almost Blue '' then struggles to get out from under the limitations . It left Elvis and the Attractions , who had spent those first three albums exposing themselves as a volatile , high energy creative force , suddenly blanded into cookie cutter recordings robbed of an album worth hearing more than as a vanity project .	-1
Costello fans will likely brand me a heretic , but 'Bedroom ' seems to me to be one of his more overrated recordings . 'Beyond Belief ' and 'Man Out of Time ' certainly rate consideration in a 'Best of ' compilation . 'Long Honeymoon ' , 'Human Hands ' and 'Every Home ' are somewhat interesting . However , beyond that I find little that 's especially compelling here.There are treats on the bonus disc that I enjoy more than much of the original 'Bedroom ' recordings , thanks in part to Steve Nieve 's scorching work on the ivories . In fact , the alternative version of 'The Town Where Time Stood Still ' and the toe-tap inducing `` From Head to Toe '' merit inclusion on my desert-island list of Elvis favorites .	-1
It 's commonly agreed that 'Goodbye ' is not one of Costello 's better efforts . I concur , but must confess enjoyment of two songs that are generally cursed by EC purists : 'I Wan na Be Loved ' and 'Only Flame in Town'.While not lyrically compelling , I find the songs musically enjoyable . Love the strange synth feel to ' Wan na ' and even the sax solo . The demo version of 'Only Flame ' on EC 's 'All This Useless Beauty ' bonus disc is superior to the standard recording here . Costello originally seems to have conceived the song as a 50s style slow dance number . It 's kitschy but fun ! 'The Comedians ' , also recorded by the late Roy Orbison , is about the only other cut of significant interest . Like 'Only Flame ' , the demo version of this song on Rhino 's 'All This Useless Beauty ' bonus disc is better than the one here .	-1
Punch The Clock was an attempt to court the pop charts that worked . Goodbye Cruel World was the hideous follow-up . The only decent songs of note were the duet with Daryl Hall , & quot ; The only flame in town & quot ; and & quot ; I wan na be loved & quot ; , with Green from Scritti Politti on backing vocals , with maybe & quot ; Joe Porterhouse & quot ; an honorable mention ( it did n't become a really good song until he turned it into & quot ; ( I love you ) When you sleep & quot ; for Tracie 's Paul Weller-produced debut LP ) .The ponderousness that has marred much of Costello 's material ever since starts with the Impostor single & quot ; Peace in our time & quot ; - and we 've been suffering the consequences ever since . Get everything up through Punch The Clock , and then punch the clock .	-1
I love E.C. , I love the Attractions , I love Nick Lowe , so I was SO excited when this came out , as it was so hot on the heels of King of America . I was actually disappointed with King of America ( it has improved with age , like a fine wine ) , so I saw this as an obvious attempt to return to the fantastic form of his pre-Punch the Clock days . As I listened , I was so let down . I thought this album was a noisy mess with weak songs . As time passed , I thought perhaps I 'd been subverted by my own high expectations , so I bought the Ryko reissue and gave it another chance . Well , my opinion has n't changed . It 's still a struggle to listen to this album , possibly even more so as my ears have aged and the mid-range heavy production grates more than ever . I hate to say it , but I 'd rather listen to Goodbye Cruel World than this album .	-1
How the son of a country star could claim to have hillbilly credibility is frankly beyond me , but there he is . For the most part , Hank sounds like just what he really is , a poseur whining about the trails of being a rich rock star . He does hit the mark on occasion as with ` The American Dream ' and ` A Country Boy Can Survive ' but mostly this is just fluff	-1
This is my 2nd time out for Baez 's second album . I 'm a big fan of the first album and of her contemporary Carolyn Hester but I 'd forgotten that I traded this one in years ago . The arrangements are dull and pedestrian and it 's amazing how irritating Joan 's voice can be when the material ( or it just the arrangements ) are so weak.I 'm a folk fan , Dylan , Carolyn Hester , Peter , Paul and Mary , the Weavers , Journeymen , Roger McGuinn , Fairport , Kingston Trio , and Ian and Sylvia are special favorites . So , it 's not so easy for me to dislike a straight-ahead folk album like this one . However , I found Joan Baez 's 2nd album a very difficult listen the 2nd time out.It 's back in the trade-in pile ( for the 2nd time ! ) .	-1
Fantastic Voyage is the only good song on this excuse for an album . The rest of the songs are not even the least bit interesting . The other songs are n't even worth listening to . Unless you are Coolio 's # 1 fan , then do n't this unless it 's used for real cheap . None of the songs seem like & quot ; fantastic voyage & quot ; and that is what turned me off .	-1
Because suckers by it , quickly get bored by it , then try to sell it.Except there are more suckers than buyers.Gangsta indeed . Only an idiot thinks gangsta 's are good at making music.OK the dumbos who disagree can now press the `` not helpful '' button , and the smart people can , at least , consider what I 've written .	-1
But sadly it 's not enough to save the album . Except for that one song the album fails on many levels ( Even for rap music ) with it 's anoying lyrics , bad beats , and even bad rapping ! Personally I think this guy has got some talent and is just afraid to use it . He proved he 's got the skill to be one of the greatest rappers out there with & quot ; Gangsta 's Paradise , & quot ; and in the & quot ; Space Jam & quot ; soundtrack he ( With the help of other rappers ) helped make the best rap song I 've herd ! He just needs to use some of his talent and he could go far and shove cheap rappers like Eminem out of the way !	-1
In an age of `` boom boom '' dance music and overblown , hyperamplified grunge , I was inclined to think that , when I heard Coolio 's `` Gangsta 's Paradise '' - even as I was knowing about what `` gangsta '' meant in relation to rap - was something a little better.The fact was/is , that this style of synthesised , semimelodic rap today sounds like the perfect prototype for , yes , the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears . Coolio clearly sounded like he wanted to remove the melodies and the hooks that at least made commcercial music from the eighties easy to listen to ( well , I listened to nothing but for the best part of two decades ) and replace it with a synthesised , airy , flyweight sound that would serve perfectly as background music on your commercial station . The song is not memorable like hit singles of the 1980s were , and the singer can never tell whether he wants to talk or actually to sing.This was perhaps the first song to be a hit AS background music on the radio , rather than from simple , catchy lyrics and vocals that had made hit singles before . As it stands today , this soundtrack rap album is almost a protype for the Backstreet Boys , who sound quite similar to Coolio , actually , even if they never rapped.If you like the Backstreet Boys or N'Sync ( no need for rudeness ) you 'll love this for the meandering melodies and total absence of memorable rhythms . if you want more substance , stay right away . Coolio copies Stevie Wonder 's `` Pasttime Paradise '' on this one : going back to the source would be most welcome .	-1
Very generic . No soul . No substance . No life . No emotion from the artist . No creativity . No nothing .	-1
You really have the impression somehow that she ca n't sing . Also the songs do n't seem spectacular . It 's weak dancey stuff - like DJ Bobo and all those acts . This is really a no-go for me	-1
if you read any of my other reviews you will hear my go on and on about the misfits and what an influence they had/have on me . so why only the one star ? because if youll notice the track list , it is simply the last 7 songs on the collection 1 album and the last 5 on the collection 2 ... so you may already own this and not even know it . just buy collection 1 and 2 and you WILL then have this album too !	-1
This review refers to the 180g vinyl edition , released on the Vinyl Lovers label .I bought this album on vinyl because the remastered cd has a terribly compressed digital sound , only to discover that this album has been mastered directly from the cd and also has that awful digitally compressed sound , which defeats the object of buying the vinyl to hear this record in it 's original glorious analogue sound .Vinyl Lovers might be the name of the record label , but do they really love the sound of vinyl , as all of their releases on vinyl have been directly mastered from the digital cd releases ( including the bonus tracks ) , and all sound terrible .It makes buying vinyl from this record label pointless !	-1
Please , somebody tell me what sort of `` trail '' Stryper blazed for other bands . As if a million other cheesy , Slaughter-like metal rock groups suddenly just dropped their immoral values to spread a Christian message back in the 80s , just because Stryper was doing it . As for other Christian rock bands that Stryper may have inspired , that 's absolutely wonderful , but did any of those bands ever really hit the mainstream ? Does n't seem so to me . Again , I fail to see these guys as trailblazers in any way , shape or form . If anything , I see them as cliched bandwagon jumpers of the 80 's heavy-metal scene.Musically , these guys had talent , but their slick sound is completely laughable . I 've no problem with the message they tried to spread , I actually believe in it . But to say these guys were trendsetters who `` paved the way '' for other Christian bands is a joke . Stryper was and is a one-hit-wonder rock group , over-produced and over-sheened , a cliched bunch of 80s hacks when you get right down to it . Hell , these guys do n't even get played on 80s compilation CDs , they 're that ridiculous , even by the heavy-metal standards of the 80s , of which there were many sorry bands.For a true trailblazing band that spreads a positive message without compromising themselves , their values , and their image , check out a little known band named Pearl Jam .	-1
I remember when this cd was released in the 80 's ... the supergroup made of some great musicians of prog music ... .this album got immediate success , everybody liked it . Now listen to this cd again and realize how this was a poor cd . I did and I can say that this album is really poor and I wo n't listen to it for the rest of my life , this is the kind of pop prog for the mass and has nothing to do with real prog music . Instead , look for what these guys has made in the 70 's with their respective bands and you 'll see the difference ... .	-1
This is a case in point about what was wrong with the 80 's , my least favorite decade musically . In the 70 's , you could trust a union of musicians of this magnitude to produce scorching , jaw dropping prog rock . But in the 80 's it only amounted to overproduced , manufactured for mass consumption , calculated FM corporate rock . There is nothing prog about Asia . Anyone who thinks this is prog needs to listen to these musicians in their better days of glory with UK , Yes , ELP , King Crimson . My opinion on this one will never change with time . File with GTR under 80 's bad idea supergroups .	-1
terrible supergroup schlock . If this is their best cd , I wonder how terrible the others are . mind alteringly dumb lyrics that are mindless pervade this cd , by the official `` prog rock supergroup . '' supergroups tend to suck hard , and I would say that this band blows more than most . Avoid at all costs , there is much better prog music out there . I was previously a fan of the work these guys did in other bands before , and I am extremely dissappointed that something so aseptic could be brought forth by them . Maybe they did n't have that much talent in the first place .	-1
It 's really tough for me to come to terms with hearing '80s distorted guitar on this album 's title track , the cover of `` ( You 're So Square ) Baby I Do n't Care '' , where she honestly sounds like Sting on vocals , and `` You Dream Flat Tires '' . Did Joni think she was some sort of '80s hair metal star ? Similarly , it 's tough for me to hear all that '80s production stuff on `` Ladies ' Man '' ( ooh ! That 's my theme song ! ) , `` Man to Man '' , `` Under the Streetlight '' ( which has '80s guitar and '80s synthesizers ) and `` Solid Love '' . Now , when she does the Hejira-era jazz thing , as on `` Moon in the Window '' and `` Love '' , it can be nice , but when she does it again on `` Be Cool '' , it turns out awful . The album 's lone classic is `` Chinese Caf & eacute ; /Unchained Melody '' , which is a killer folk-jazz song with great lyrics about the passage of time and a lot of bass playing ( presumably by Jaco Pastorious ) . Arguably my favorite Joni Mitchell song , on one of her worst albums . Is that irony or what ? For the most part though , this is a boring record with a lot of unwise '80s production trends , saved only by Joni 's voice . It 's better than what would come next , though .	-1
When `` Here I Go Again '' comes on the radio , i always end up listening for a few moments just because I am baffled about how bad some songwriting can be . Its hilarious that when you hear a line , you can predict the next one . I dont think Coverdale means anything he sings ... he just picked the words cuz it sounds good ... to him anyway.In the Still of the Night is no better . The music sounds as if they intended it to be some brooding rock anthem . Its like they were trying to create some type of mystery and suspense building towards some rock zenith ... but when you hear the lyrics ... .all they are saying is `` Im horny ... gim me some '' . Hey , Im not opposed to songs about sex , but give me a break , dont pretend like you 're telling me something brilliant.All in all , Whitesnake is exactly what Spinal Tap was making fun of . I bet Whitesnake didnt even get the joke .	-1
Altoough the musicians involved in this album are all great British accomplished guys ( Sykes , Murray and Dunbar ) , it 's a shame to hear COverdale , one of the most authentic rock voices of all time , turn into Californian mainstream glam metal . Sad.. Anyway , there are great pices of musical hability .	-1
How bad is this . During the late 80s the whole big hair thing and ballad thing was the new and everyone loved it . Whitesnake compared too great bands of that era ( metallica or guns n roses ) , is nothing compared too them . Sure they wrote Here I Go Again but all that is is just another power ballad that was so over used that era . Every single song Whitesnake pretty much has ever writtien is a freaking ballad i mean sure one or two songs but the whole album ? come on . Way too much synth and ballads too be called a metal album . It just doesent work Here i Go Again isnt even that good and Is THis Love is the worse song of all time . Dont buy horrible band horrible album would give zero starts . By far not the greatest album of all time in fact its one of the worse	-1
Dancin ' Clown . My god . This might not be as patently awful as Dog Eat Dog but it gives it a run for its money . To think people like REM and The Cure were making great records at this time that still hold up among a pretty great punk and alt scene and stuff like this just looks purely awful in comparison . I love Joni but this album does n't hold although there a few okay songs . Avoid or torrent or find for free . Who are the people that keep saying this has great melodies and that each and every record she makes is pure gold ? Tasteless people you should avoid . I mean some of the stuff here is not bad but it 's certainly not anything to get excited over . Cool Water has that weird 80s vibe with some decent lyrics and a guy singing that does n't sound too bad with her but it still is the bottom of the barrel with that 80s musical accompaniment . If you need an 80s album really bad from her than you might as well get Wild Things ... . that album while not very good is still ahead of the next two by a mile .	-1
I dug this CD out of my collection yesterday , put it on , and started working on the computer with `` Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm '' playing . The opening duet with Peter Gabriel was pleasant enough , but by the time I heard `` Lakota '' chanted over and over , I realized this CD was both dated and discordant . As I tried to sit through a duet of Billy Idol and Ms. Mitchell , I wondered what twisted muse had inspired one of my favorite singer/songwriters on this less than stellar recording.There are some bright moments here and there , but Ms. Mitchell 's better works do not , in my opinion , include this album . I see from reading some of the other reviews that I am apparently `` ignorant '' or worse , and I 'm sure that I 'll soon have as many negative votes as a porcupine has quills for daring to state a qualified assessment of an icon 's work.Guess , I 'm the skunk at the picnic on this one .	-1
Like that '80s depth of field , enjoy the synthesizer when it 's used sparingly and tastefully , as it is here . Funny that the '80s now sounds more dated than some of the music Joni references from the past , a cool cover of `` Cool Water '' , plus a few other songs recalling `` Johnny Angel '' and `` Corrina , Corrina '' ( Mitchell 's got ta be thinkin ' 'bout Big Joe 's version , yeah ... ) .Opening song , `` My Special Place '' , is pretty okay - sounds like the theme to an unsold 1987 TV pilot about a coffee shop run by two 36 year old divorced feminists.Once again , her lyrics stand alone as poetry - and there is n't , and never was , a whole lot of rock and rollers who could seriously sell their words separate from their music . And this keeps Chalk in a Rainstorm on the home carousel .	-1
This is not one of the strongest albums Joni Mitchell has released . The are a lot of guest vocalists and they do n't always match with Joni 's voice or songwriting . The lyrics are ok as well as Joni 's voice , but the synths sound so dated by now . Most of the songs suffer from that . There are a lot of albums who have a distinct 80 's sound but this one has n't hold up that good . I own all of Joni 's albums and hate to talk bad about her but this album is not one of my favourites . There is only one song on this album that is really good , the closer A Bird That Whistles . A simple acoustic track with saxophone from Wayne Shorter . The photography on the cover is beautiful as well . So , not one of her best but she has made so many exellent albums that this one pales compared to those .	-1
Together with the other guys in Eagles , Don Henley assured his immortal place in rock history . I wonder - how can a man who was a part of something so great as the Eagles release such a [ bad ] bunch of songs ? I just do n't get it ! I owned this album for many years but when it was time to `` weed out '' my cd collection I decided that this one have to go . But before I sold it , I wanted to record the best songs from it , but I must admit that I could n't find a single song I really like . So , now it 's gone , and I have not missed it for even a split second !	-1
As usual with Audio Fidelity releases the sound is awfull . Compare this cd with the similar tracks on the Rhino 3 cd compilation-The Rhino beats it flat out . I do not know what Hoffman and Gray do with the rematering job other than their releases just sounds awfull . Flat , dull , veiled , compressed , like a thick blanket in front of the speakers.A complete waste of money to buy AF release of this album . A pity sins the music is very good .	-1
For those who like their saccharine straight up , this album poses few challenges . Rickie sings her slouchy style competently enough , serving up a a candy colored bouquet of easy listening tracks . Only three of these blossoms have any thorns -- 9 , 11 and 12 . Of these , 12 is a real gem of feeling and honesty leaving the cutsey crap well behind . Would an album filled with songs only like track 12 sell ? Probably not , but it would be glorious .	-1
Walked into my favourite record shop to see what stuff has been re-issued , as I love my 70 's and 80 's . My eye 's lid up to see a `` Siouxsie & The Banshees '' greatest hits sitting on the shelf . My hand races out to pick it up in full anticipation of finding my favourite punk tune on there ; `` spell bound '' , and ugh ! , I could n't believe it . This group finally releases a greatest hits here in Australia , and the best song is not even on it . As good as a hot chocolate in winter , without the chocolate ? ? .	-1
Lisa Loeb luck change when friend Ethan Hawke suggested that her cheesy track STAY should become the leading single for the soundtrack of REALITY BITES back in 1994 . The corny track rocketed to # 1 and Loeb was the first artist with a top single without owning a record contract . After that Geffen did n't hesitate and give this College Girl a chance . But little that they knew that Lisa Loeb cards where not that well played . She recorded a bland album , listening to this album is like sitting in a coffee shop in a rainy day with improvise lyrics and all about sadness and emptyness . So an entire record of the same thing you get extremely bored and wondering why was the fuss over STAY , DO YOU SLEEP was a follower , but none of the rest tracks are worth the listen , even she reply herself on LISA LISTEN , TAFFY it 's anoying , WAITING FOR WEDNESDAY is simple POP tune . No wonder this album did n't achieve platinum status just GOLD : meaning : well Geffen Records only shipped half million copies of this . Sorry Miss Loeb , you 're debut was weak , your sophomore work better , but after that you jumped into indies , but still , you need a great producer to get the thing that you do n't let out .	-1
I bought this album and found it to be very disappointing . I listened to sample clips online and thought they sounded great especially 'Taffy ' . Then when I listened to the entire album I found it to be dull and flat . A couple catchy songs here and there but overall it was n't as good as I expected . I 'm taking my copy back to the used CD store . Lisa Loeb seems like a nice person but I can see why she was a one-hit-wonder . =/	-1
I do n't know why this album gets the props it does . there does n't seem to be any point where the production or the emceeing tries to grab you ... .and yet this is heralded as not only a classic , but by many people as the greatest hip hop album ever . It 's nowhere near an Illmatic , The Infamous , Stress The Extinction Agenda , 93 to Infinity , any Kool G Rap ' early to mid 90 's stuff , Stunts Blunts & Hip Hop , Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde etc , etc , etc ... it does n't even come close to 36 Chambers . I think this album is boring .	-1
Honestly , White Zombie was techno-metal enough as it was . Why did they go and do something so stupid . These remixes are terrible . El Phantasmo and the Chicken Run Blastorama and Boogie Man are the only good tracks on here . This is just miserable . Seriously , this is a joke right ?	-1
I love Madness . I 've payed large sums of money for import CDs . And believe me , this is an absolutely TERRIBLE retrospective . First of all , you only have twelve tracks . Given the variety of the band 's work , how is it possible to paint an adequate picture with that few songs ! ? Secondly , the actual song selection is stunningly terrible . The group 's later period was n't bad , but it certainly was n't good enough that you 'd want to clutter HALF THE CD with songs from their last two albums ! Then we have two songs from Seven and two from The Rise and Fall -- decent enough selections ; perhaps if ALL their albums were thus represented this would be better . Unfortunately , they 're not -- Absolutely is entirely ignored , and all we have from One Step Beyond is the title track . It also has the non-album single It Must be Love , but as that 's found on the infinitely better self-titled compilation , that 's no excuse to buy this . And , of course , the track order shows no rhyme and reason at all ( One Step Beyond , LAST ? ) . All in all , even though it includes some good songs , this is absolutely ( not a pun ) inexcusable . Buy Madness -- it was released while the group was still around , so it 's not entirely authoritative , but it includes work from their best period , INCLUDING the excellent House of Fun , which you wo n't find anywhere else this side of the Atlantic . Star FAR away from this mess .	-1
This is a terrible retrospective which , without any other knowledge of the band , would lead many to conclude that Madness were little more than a crappy New-Wave band . Everyone knows `` Our House . '' I 'm glad `` One Step Beyond '' made the list . How come no `` Night Boat to Cairo '' or `` House of Fun '' ? Pass this up , and just get the first album instead .	-1
I 'm afraid to say this is an uninspiring album . The single most glaring deficiency which it exhibits is the songwriters ' respective inabilities to develop a tune . As a result , it is very , very boring . The ballads sometimes have interesting lyrics , but they are all delivered in a flat monotone with very little variation in the music either. & quot ; Let 's Go & quot ; is easily the best song on the album , with a good start and a driving progression , but even this runs out of steam/ideas towards the end of the chorus ; as a result they have to tunelessly shout the title and some other words just so they can move on to the next verse . & quot ; Everybody have Fun Tonight & quot ; is not quite as good , but at least is much better than passable and its ending is a strong as its start . Other than & quot ; Hypnotise Me & quot ; , which is mildly clever , the rest are very , very weak.Oh , and & quot ; The World in which we Live & quot ; ends this mind-numbing collection . Seven long minutes where the song goes nowhere and they just have to chant the title as a 'climax ' . Oh dear . The most memorable thing about the song is the obscenities at the start of it , which are totally gratuitous , unnecessary and are just another example of the bells and whistles this band will pull out to try to revive the album despite their weak songwriting.One star is probably harsh ( I thought hard about this ) , but it is nonetheless difficult to give it two stars on the basis of two good songs out of eight . Very , very disappointing .	-1
`` Everybody Have Fun '' and `` Let 's Go '' are terrific pop songs , catchy and with a beat . I must 've heard them ( involuntarily ) hundreds of times on my health club sound system over the years . They are quite good . `` Hypnotize Me '' and `` Eyes of the Girl '' are pretty good , too . The rest are dull and boring , and the last one , `` World in Which We Live '' is pretty awful.I bought this record on vinyl when it came out , and rarely had the patience to sift through the tracks by lifting and dropping the needle . Now , with all my music on my computer , I can pick and choose , and I 've put the above four tracks onto my hard disc . But for those of you looking to shell out money for a good new CD , it probably is n't worth it . The four good songs are probably on some best-of collection , a better choice .	-1
Jimmy Page is all over the guitar here , but the writing stinks . The vocals , the engineering that 's like driving nails into your ears -- I 'd rather hear two gerbils run up and down a Strat with a bent neck and strings about to snap.If you want latter day Jimmy Page , check out `` Live At The Greek '' with The Black Crowes as a backing band or his duos with Robert Plant . There 's a reason `` Outrider '' is selling for 3 1/2 bucks .	-1
Tragic Kingdom by No Doubt is highly overrated . The songs released were pretty good but after all these years , this album is dated and annoying now . This disc is heavy in ska which is no longer popular , no wonder they had to change their sound after this album . Do n't Speak was a great ballad but after you hear it 30,000 times you get sick of it . The only track I still appreciate is Sunday Morning , great hook and chorus . This album is considered their masterpiece , but I 've heard better .	-1
I hate Gwen 's yelling , screeching vocals and all the songs accept for `` Do n't Speak . '' The dance/pop band Clueless does a decent cover of `` Spiderwebs , '' but it just sounds like a lot of noise by No doubt .	-1
This CD is n't so great ... the only really good song is & quot ; Do n't Speak & quot ; ... it 's a shame , I was hoping for more songs like it , but they are all & quot ; strange & quot ; . I should have known better than to get a CD with rotted peaches on the cover ! Oh well ... at least it DOES have that one song on it ...	-1
It 's a testament to the band 's strengths that Massive Attack 's worst album still works on any level at all . But compared to the albums immediately before and after it , it 's nothing to write home about . Their first album BLUE LINES was a milestone in the world of trip hop , and it seems like the group was n't sure how to follow it up . Unfortunately , they did the worst possible thing : they basically made the same album again , but not as well . If I ever make an album as great as BLUE LINES , I 'll be tempted to copy myself too , but hopefully I 'll do a better job than they did.Protection opens with a slow dramatic opener just like its predecessor , but `` Protection '' lacks the spare menace and singular production of `` Safe From Harm '' , and Tracey Thorn is a much more conventional vocalist than the last album 's Shara Nelson . The tiny `` Payback '' sample in the middle of the song 's main riff is cute , but otherwise this song eases into background music mode too much to be effective , and the rest of the album follows in this vein . `` Karmacoma '' is one of the better tunes of the bunch , with great vocals by the soon-to-quit Tricky and a jumped-up dub beat . It 's a poor cousin to BLUE LINES ' `` Five Man Army '' , but still not bad . The thing that really sinks this album is the instrumentals . `` Weather Storm '' and `` Heat Miser '' are completely inconsequential tracks that meander aimlessly and suck up eight minutes of the listener 's attention for no good reason . The production on this album is overall much warmer and less abrasive than their previous work , so these instrumental bits really turn into Muzak . There 's another minor triumph mid-album with `` Better Things '' , one of the few instances on the record where both the vocals and the music are equally gripping . The live cover of `` Light My Fire '' at the end is just the final nail in the coffin ; it 's abrasive , but in the wrong way . It sounds like it was made by a completely different , and much crappier , reggae rock band . I 'm getting pissed off just listening to it as I compose this review.Shortly after the release of this album , Massive Attack contracted the Mad Professor to remix it , and his version of the record , NO PROTECTION , is leagues better . After that , the band underwent a massive ( ha ! ) reinvention , and played up their more monolithic side for the enormous-sounding MEZZANINE . So there are lots of really great Massive Attack albums you could buy before you need to consider getting this one . If I had known beforehand what a disappointment this is , I probably would n't own it myself .	-1
This overrated album doesn ` t do much for me . I don ` t really see what ` s so special about it , and I believe it ` s the band ` s worse record . The title song is a good opener , and & quot ; Karmakoma & quot ; is a great moment as well , but after the third track , & quot ; Three & quot ; , it all goes downhill and turns into an average and bland trip-hop/ downtempo record . The last song , a cover of & quot ; Light my fire & quot ; , is particularly weak and just puts me away.A disappointig and souless album , & quot ; Protection & quot ; is alright as background music , but not much else .	-1
I bought this CD after being exposed to Nicolette 's amazing vocals on Plaid 's amazing `` extork '' . On `` Protection '' she sings `` Three '' and `` Sly '' . These songs are fine ( the music 's a little snoozy ) but her underground solo work is generally better . The other tracks range from dull to downright irritating . Sounding hodgepodged , there is no common style nor theme to this album.I even bought Massive Attack 's `` No Protection '' remixes hoping for better luck as well as different takes of the Nicolette tracks ( so I can cut and paste my own remixes on my MD player ) . Well , her voice is n't even ON that disc , and as a whole the music was even LESS memorable.Perhaps Massive Attack , though seemingly popular , just is n't for me . Maybe they just are n't strange and distinctive enough to suit my tastes . ...	-1
I thought Sneaker Pimps really had something going when I first heard & quot ; 6 Underground & quot ; , but then when I heard the rest of the CD , I was very glad that I did n't buy the CD and just heard someone else 's copy of it . The songs are nothing like & quot ; 6 Underground & quot ; and are lacking in both originality and artistic talent . Not a good buy . If you bought the CD , then you probably find yourself skipping through the entire CD and listening to the last song which was a remix by another artist . The original is almost terrifying . The rest of the CD is just garbage .	-1
I really enjoy 6 Underground and Spin Spin Sugar , do n't get me wrong . Those are great songs to have ! ! The rest of this CD was a big disappointment . It is unusual for me to prefer `` radio '' songs over the rest of an artist 's offerings since the latter is typically more creative , in-depth , and genuine . However , for the rest of the album it appears that the Sneaker Pimps focused more on producing a sleazy , hiply dark image rather than making music . I was expecting a darkly sensual album when I bought this but the actual musical content leaves me hungry . In terms of a truly full album in this kind of popular music , Garbage easily performs better . If I could do it over again , I 'd find the album and radio versions of 6 Underground and Spin Spin Sugar on singles or compilations instead .	-1
I do n't even know why everybody else likes this album so much -- it 's repetitive , drags on forever ... and the rhythms for each song do n't even sound very good to begin with ! I did n't even buy this album , it was so irritating . Instead , I previewed some songs on Grooveshark [ Grooveshark is a free online website where you can listen to any song you 'd like -- serious ] . I hardly made it through even the first song . Come on , Daft Punk -- you can still be fun techno robots , but STOP BEING SO REPETITIVE ! ! In Oh Yeah , these are the only lyrics -- Oh yeah/ Oh yeah/ Oh yeah/ Everybody on the dance/ Crazy on the dance/ Oh yeah/ Oh YeahMost other songs did n't have any lyrics at all ! The only good song was Revolution 909 , which is still repetitive . The other songs are n't for parties and clubs -- they 're for freaking torture ! This is something else I have to get out -- On `` Random Access Memories '' , DP 's newest album , why did some people think that some of the lyrics were sad ? They were actually quite embarrassing ! [ except for one or two . ] Read the lyrics for a Maroon 5 song -- do you think that person could they compare them ! ? In all , listening to `` Homework '' is worse than actually doing homework . It 's just a bunch of crap . Maybe I 'd recommend this album for people who want to give themselves splitting headaches . This was probably written by a robot who was broken .	-1
Okay , so I have to admit it . I own this CD . I do listen to it from time to time , but that is becoming rare . The beats were fun and maybe it was just the crazy video for & quot ; Around The World & quot ; that got me interested . But enough is enough . In & quot ; Da Funk & quot ; , how many times can you hear that one riff before your head explodes or you just have to turn it off ? Give me a break . They have some good reiffs going , now they just need to get the rest of the songs going .	-1
I tried my best to like this cd but it just was n't happening . The tracks ranged in quality from annoying to unbearable . Consider Discovery first before buying this cd unless you are truly a fan .	-1
If Paula Abdul ever records another album , my ears will explode in blood . Her debut album was stealing the sound of the era The New Jack Swing , originally of GUY and many others , what Abdul had was the moves and the producers who knew how to cover her voice in extremely catchy beats so she can dance to it in the overproduced videos and people would run to the record store and buy her debut album ( wich by the way as many stated here outsold Abdul expectations , by selling more than 7 million copies in the US alone WOW ! ) , of course this slick record contains 4 # 1 singles but only two of them sound like # 1 , STRAIGHT UP wich I must confess to like , and COLD HEARTED dirty things always sells , but OPPOSITTES ATTRACT i do not respect an artist who dances with animated cats , and FOREVER YOUR GIRL sound sooo sooo DATED ! ... .I bought this album when I was a child so it 's soooooo long ago , Miss Abdul had her time , now she 's an AI judge ( wich in any way will make Paula look any cooler , just the other way around ) , Paula Abdul was in FACT very very LUCKY ... .because sadly this album lacks of consistensy and do not include the original video version ( boomer ) ... ..Paula surely knew people in the industry that 's why she got the type of marketing she got , a clever move for a cute sweet corny cheesy Cali Girl .	-1
I remember how big a deal this disc was back in the late 80s , but I just never got it ... or her . The & quot ; Straight Up & quot ; and & quot ; Forever Your Girl & quot ; songs were awful pop tunes and that & quot ; Opposites Attract & quot ; video was just plain awful with the obnoxious animated cat . Then the allegations surfaced that she never really sang leads on the album . I did like the & quot ; Way That You Love Me & quot ; song . Now that was pretty sweet .	-1
Some songs are good ( especially & quot ; Straight Up & quot ; ) , but some songs are n't as good . Anyway , it 's pretty good to listen to .	-1
I decided recently to pull out my old vinyl of Paula Abdul and spin this baby.Well I have noticed since I am now about 11 years older I realized Abdul 's voice now gets on my nerves , and that her songs though they had their place and time in 1989 just do n't hold up well today.Songs like & quot ; Straight Up & quot ; , & quot ; Knocked Out & quot ; , and & quot ; The Way That You Love Me & quot ; , just do n't infect me like some old pop songs do like The Emotions & quot ; Best of My Love & quot ; or Lovin ' Spoonfuls & quot ; Summer in the City & quot ; ... .get the picture ? Unless your an Abdul fanatic , all I can say is this is really run of the mill pop with some infectious hooks ... I think if Madonna , or Deborah Gibson ( who have stronger voices ) sang these dittys they may hold up better .	-1
Been there done that sound . I can think of a thousand bands that deserve the deluxe remastering treatment over this drivel .	-1
It 's a shame 'cause Depeche Mode used to be such a great band - it was even THE band back in my gymnasium times.What a pity to release such a sleepy album . The instrumentation on 'Ultra ' is pretty inventive but most of the songs do lack positivity and maybe even musical willingness . You simply get sleepy , 'cause they 're all in the same far too slow atmosphere.Especially the hit single 'Barrel Of A Gun ' is embarrassingly boring . Not worth the former Depeche Mode quality stamp.Only highlights are 'It 's No Good ' which COULD make it to a 'Best Of ' compilation , and 'Freestate ' , especially its crispy guitar.Depeche Mode needs to work on this adjusted style . It can work . But it 'll TAKE some work ! A big compliment though for sending 'Ultra ' out on vinyl too ! !	-1
Ian Anderson 's 1st solo album , well what 's so different about that , virtually every Tull album since Mick Abrahams departure is an Ian solo album . Of course this had to happen in the early 80 's when everyone made their stinky synthesizer robot boy album and this one 's no exception . Like The Human League with a flute player . Very Un-Tull , so was Under Wraps ; at least 'A ' had Eddie Jobson , chops a plenty , and still a nod or two to the more earthy past . Pass on this one please !	-1
this cat is a one hit wonder clone.2nd tier BabyFace & amp ; Prince.aside from nobody knows the rest of his album is flat.he should just stick to song-writting.cuz his Productions and singing just ride off of Babyface 's & amp ; prince 's backs .	-1
Sure this CD has some good tracks , however the second CD is just plain wack , the only good song on the second CD is & quot ; all eyes on me & quot ; the rest is all filler , Me against the world was pac 's only good album , the rest of his albums are wack .	-1
I , for one will be glad when this west coast `` gangsta '' b.s . is finally put to rest . ( 13 years of anti-life thinking has got die sometime . ) This album which was blaring out of cars throughout 1996 and I was tired of hearing Tupac 's rants about women , Biggie , and jail.There are only two good songs on this trifiling 20 something song fest , `` California Love '' and `` I ai n't mad Cha '' . Pac was a gifted lyricist , but he is not the greatest m.c . in rap 's history . ( that goes to melly mel , chuck d , and run ) and frankly this is another example of black amerikkkan ghetto nihlism ( in which he never came from ) for profit . I get tired of hearing young brothers say to me that Pac speaks for me as a `` black man '' ( because he was stupid enough to get shot twice and the second one was fatal please . ) all he ever cared about was making money of black suffering along with Suge Knight , throw this cd in the garbage heap along with any L.A/Compton hip-hop outside of Hireoglyphics , Jurrasic 5 , and The Coup . Gangsta Rap has all but killed creativity inside of commerical Hip-Hop since 1990 it has got to go ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
This ... was pretty weak . The beats were some of the worst I 've ever heard , and 2pac 's got a terrible flow . I really do n't know what people see in this album . There 's only like 10 good songs on this . I ca n't believe some people think this is the greatest album . This is n't even the greatest double disc .	-1
a good poet he was.but a average rapper.he was a better actor than anything else.his music does n't move me like public enemy or rakim.i find him to be way overrated.a few alright songs on this two-disc set but alot of filler.he ai n't no legend to me.self-destructive more likely.this album is pure garbage .	-1
2pac is wack . He 's no where near Biggie or Nas . People need to realize this . 2pac was all about image , his music was garbage . Buy `` Ready To Die '' or `` Illmatic '' instead .	-1
I downloaded this music for free thank goodness just because of all the five star reviews . After listening to this album I have my doubts about these five star reviews . Not much to say about the album except I was totally disappointed . The album was monotonous and boring to the extreme . Almost all of the songs sounded the same . The same guitar rifts , slow beat , and jamming on each song . The song Washer was so so , but was ruined by the lyrics of the lead singer . It sounds like a group of guys in their late teens/early twenties ( which they probably were ) in a garage just jamming with no common goal or purpose with each band member having their own direction or agenda . No band assimilation whatsoever . To make matters worse the lead singer is not actually singing but just occasionally speaking or telling a story . Fortunately he speaks so low that you ca n't even tell what he 's saying with headphones on . Not that it matters what he 's saying anyway.The band reminds me just a little of a much less talented and interesting version of the great band Bedhead . Bottom line this album was terrible and would never even consider listening to their other music .	-1
2 1/2Overly cited indiecency that barely maintains any lasting intrigue past an important lead-off track .	-1
Shellac is a great LIVE band , but on vinyl , except for the first singles , they are absolute crap ! -The folks here that give this `` art piece '' 5 stars are just Albini A** kissers , is all ! Great engineer , no doubt , but most anything post Big Black or Rapeman , his MUSIC just does n't translate on recorded media ! More like a `` fart piece '' because it falls flat like one . The only good song here is `` The Admiral '' , & it was on one of their singles . Albini should just stick to playing live , and quit recording his music , it 'll give him the most unique `` indie cred '' anyone could ever enjoy ! What a waste of vinyl , of which he & I most truly love ! The Only Good Recorded Shellac Songs List , in order , are:1 . Doris2 . Wingwalker3 . Copper4 . Prayer To God5 . Rambler Song6 . The Admiral7 . XVI8 . The Guy Who Invented Fire9 . Steady As She Goes10 . SpokeThat 's IT ! -now Steve , record these songs live , put it out as a `` best of '' comp , then retire from composing `` sound '' & just engineer it !	-1
I am admittedly frustrated with `` Don Caballero II . '' As a fan of bands like Rumah Sakit , Volta do Mar , and more recently , Battles and Lite , I am a late-blooming fan of math rock . Of course , research into the style inevitably led me to Don Caballero , and I picked up `` World Class Listening Problem , '' which I really liked . I decided to get some of their back catalog , and started with Don Caballero II . What I got was the auditory equivalent of having my eyes propped open to watch a documentary about humanity 's most amazing scientific discoveries , but randomly spliced with scenes of brutal torture . Yes , it rocked . Yes , it was brilliantly executed . Yes , Don Che has eight arms . There was no question as to whether or not I respected what it represented , but no matter how much I listened to it , I could not bring myself to genuinely like it.What I hear with `` Don Caballero II '' is an underdeveloped compositional approach . Structure is played fast and loose . There are lots of starts and stops , but very few beginnings and endings . Without a clear idea of when things finish , it is difficult to tell when new things begin . The result is often jarring . I get the feeling that the band is trying to capture a sense of improvisation , within which some meandering is permissible . Without a clear sense of when the journey begins , though , it is difficult to look forward to arriving at a destination . Instead , I get the general sensation of wandering from one 5/8 riff to the next , hoping to find a shortcut through the chainsaw/cymbal waterboarding scene in `` Please Tokio , Please This Is Tokio . `` Now , this may seem like I have a grudge against noise rock . I do n't . I like chaos a much as anyone . I own and enjoy listening to King Crimson 's THRaKaTTaCK , which can be quite an assault . But chaos , no matter how precisely it is executed , does n't build and release tension by itself.Notice , though , that I did n't say that I hated `` Don Caballero II . '' I said that I found it frustrating , this being because the album is absolutely brilliant at times . It is most successful when the material is allowed to evolve and morph through the rhythmic and melodic variations that are suggested by the riffs themselves . The resulting auditory roller-coaster is a compelling and surprising ride of the highest order , often seamlessly finishing in an entirely different place than where it starts . Unfortunately , we rarely get to see the end of the journey before the record skips.THE LOWDOWN : I understand that part of the math-rock aesthetic is a detachment from the audience , and perhaps it is too late for me to really appreciate that mindset . I will never be able to experience Don Caballero II in the context of 1995 . Maybe I missed out . Perhaps math rock itself evolved , and I am only a fan of its later iterations . Regardless , as much as I want to like `` Don Caballero II , '' I am OK with just letting myself be frustrated by it and moving on . I welcome constructive comments on Don Caballero , because I have not given up on them yet .	-1
A perennial favourite of the chattering classes , I purchased this hoping for some high quality soul music of a similar style to the excellent Lighthouse Family - sadly there is no comparison . Firstly there are only 9 songs compared to a whopping 17 on the Very Best of the Lighthouse Family , so it 's easy to see where to go for value for money . Secondly , Mr Gayes ' anti war sentiments seem somewhat nave and foolish in today 's political climate . Thirdly , Mr Gaye ca n't sing and has to resort to shock tactics such as singing in a high voice like a lady in order to sell records . No wonder his career ground to a halt in the early 80 's ! Verdict : avoid .	-1
When listening to this record it 's useful if you 're a Christian hippie . An interesting point to make with all music is : does the listener have to be in the same state of mind as the musician in order to properly understand the music ? There 's nothing new to be said about What 's Going On that has n't already been said by many millions of other people . That is because What 's Going On was a revolutionary record addressing such issues as religion , racism , pollution , love , poverty and , of course , peace.All the main vocals are Gaye 's . Some may think that a lot of music of this time is nave , in that it 's so optimistic ( love this , love that ... ) To this must be said that a lot of the hippie artists had very many personal problems ( Marvin Gaye = Troubled Man ) . In a way , their music was a way to express idealistic dreams that are hard pressed to happen in real life.Really , the sound of this record will stay with you for a long time , from the religious wondering in 'God is Love ' to the realism in 'Inner City Blues ( Make Me Wan na Holler ) 'It could also be said that Christianity is a myth . If that is so , it 's a beautiful myth , one that has helped convey creativity .	-1
Watching BET 's Walk Of Fame tribute to Stevie the other day inspired me to write some reviews here.I do n't have the & quot ; perfect & quot ; view of this album that most Stevie fans have . Aside from Living For The City , Higher Ground , and Jesus Children Of America there is n't anything I like on this album.There is just something about Stevie 's languid , rather sappy , elevator-music ballads that I ca n't stand , and this cd has a bunch of them.Having said that , I absolutely love the great stuff on this cd , with Jesus Children Of America being the highlight for me . That alone makes it a disc worth owning , to me . Overall though , I think I am going to look into getting that multi-disc Stevie box-set that came out a few years ago or whenever it was . There just are n't enough Stevie tunes I love per-disc to make buying all his albums worth it to me . I do n't own any of those & quot ; greatest hits & quot ; types of box sets but depending on whats on that multi-disc Stevie set , I may buy it .	-1
Like always with AF releases , the sound is just so bad and lifeless . As ususal a reverse remaster job by the `` great '' Hoffman or Gray . The plot is suck the life out of the music and make it sound dull . Take away the sparkle and details . Why are not this company exsposed yet ? Why do people use USD 30 to buy these discs ? It really annoys me that this company still releases discs . It is an offense to the artists .	-1
Audio Fidelity does not use the Original master tapes on this and about all of the CD releases . They claim the sources they use are going to give the consumer a great sounding CD.If you 're not using the Original master tape then you 're comparing HDTV to analog TV.This version sounds very slightly better then the Motown release but compare the cost.I wish Mobile Fidleity would release this because they use nothing but the Original Master tape and the sound comes through.A great Stevie Wonder CD , but all of his CD 's are great ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
If you like squeaking boys , accompanied by a mostly boring orchestra , then buy this CD . Otherwise , you may hardly wish to listen to more than three or four songs ( the well known Ben and a few others ) . Do n't get me wrong , Michael Jackson is a great artist , but not as a boy . Buy HIStory or Thriller instead !	-1
Johnny Gill is One of the Best Vocalists I 've heard over the past 20 plus Years but alot of the time the Words & Music do n't match His overall presentation . I dig the cut with Him & Roger Troutman & also R.Kelly 's `` Someone to Love '' .but the up-tempo cuts do n't move me at all.this Album though is n't balanced out with much else that matches some of the better material & this set suffers from that.but if Johnny Gill ever got the right Stuff to work with He would Be scary .	-1
In Square Circle had some of lame '80s product on it , but this whole album is lame '80s product . It does n't help its cause that there 's only one unqualified success on it . `` Skeletons '' and `` Get It '' were both hit singles , and they 're fun , but routine , funk , but the fact is you can find better songs that do the same thing on virtually every other Stevie Wonder album from 1972 on . ( The third hit , `` You Will Know '' , is awful . Unbearable . I dunno , pick a negative adjective and run with it ) . The song I 'm talking about is the stomping , long funkfest `` My Eyes Do n't Cry '' . Now that 's a total classic ! I love it ! Especially the percussion and keyboard riffs . And the melody . And the chorus . And everything else about it . Everything else is a zero . The funk ( `` Dark ` n ' Lovely '' ; `` In Your Corner '' ; `` One of a Kind '' ) is forced ; the ballads ( `` You Will Know '' ; `` With Each Beat of My Heart '' ; the space-soul , `` Rocket Love '' -like `` Galaxy Paradise '' ; `` Cryin ' through the Night '' ) are overwrought . Stevie was in sad shape here .	-1
Stevie , Stevie , Stevie ! ! Where has all the brilliance gone ? There are exactly 3 , count 'em , 3 good songs on this album and they simply are n't enough to salvage what amounts to a piece of pedestrian product and half-hearted attempts at sounding comtemporary . The opener , & quot ; You Will Know & quot ; with it 's simple message of hope and lilting fairlight melody , & quot ; With Each Beat Of My Heart & quot ; , his least syrupy ballad in years and the skeletal groove of & quot ; Skeletons & quot ; and it 's indictment of liars , cheaters and cover-ups ( Corporate America should really listen to this one nowadays ) are the only worthwhile tracks here and it breaks my heart to listen to the rest of the garbage that makes up the remainder of this release . Filler is one thing , but this is ridiculous .	-1
Perhaps the thing you should know first here , before you even think about plunking down the sixty bucks , is that two of Ross 's most identifiable , signature hits , `` Ai n't No Mountain High Enough '' & amp ; `` Love Hangover '' are in their chopped-up three and a half minute 45 RPM versions . ( On their original LP 's they ran over six and seven minutes , respectively . ) For a work that 's supposed to be the exhaustive , definitive and long-awaited retrospective of so important an American singer , this is inexcusable.The last Ross single to even nudge it 's way into the top ten ( and then just barely , for only a couple weeks ) was `` Missing You '' in January 1985 . No Ross single since then has come close . Note that on this set , after you hear the song , you 've got a whole disc yet to listen to , much of it then-newly recorded 90s material meant to foster the impression that Diana was a vital , trend-setting force in pop music still . No , not that anymore , though yes , forever a diva.So why did I buy it ? In October 1993 , it was the first instance Motown released a good number of classic 60s Supremes sides back in their original mono , many that did n't make it to the `` Hitsville U.S.A. '' set , and on that score , it delivers . But this set falls far short of giving fans of the solo Diana ( which I remain ) the heartening and nostalgia-inducing reacquaintance of her recording career we 'd been waiting for . ( It was also a side-by-side failure if you 'd also bought her alleged ` biography , ' `` Secrets of a Sparrow . `` ) One has only to compare the masterpiece work done on the boxed-sets of Aretha Franklin ( `` Queen of Soul '' ) , the Temptations ( `` Emperors of Soul '' ) and James Brown ( `` Star Time '' ) with `` Forever Diana '' to know that the lady was done wrong here . Motown , it 's been 10 years - scrap this one , forget about it ( and we 'll try to too ) , and start over again .	-1
Berry Gordy and Diana Ross really Screwed up here on this 4-disc compilation . My first thought after finally getting thru the four discs was : WHAT were they thinking ? ? ? ? First , let 's start with the APPALLINGLY BAAAADDDD fourth and last Disc . The music they came up with is n't even worth a fourth-rate R & B ; singer . It 's hard to believe Diana Ross had to record such drivel . Apart from the gem `` Best Years of My Life '' , which really was a classic -- well arranged , written and performed . Aside from that one song , the entire fourth disc is a MESS ! ! And this is on a Diana Ross career retrospective collection ? ? ? Com'on Berry Gordy , surely you can do better than this ! ! While Diana 's star was on the decline as the 1990 's began , still considering her stature in the music biz , they could 've come up with better songs and choices for this career retrospective collection . Many reviewers have complained the Supremes stuff on Disc 1 does n't even belong on this retrospective and I 'd have agree . Call it `` Padding '' by Berry Gordy and possibly Diana herself for this collection . With the wealth of Motown material in the vaults from Diana the solo artist since 1970 after she left the Supremes , surely there was plenty of more material and unreleased rarities to add to this collection.They could 've taken notes from Barbra Streisand 's superb 4-disc 1991 retrospective `` Just For the Record '' , released two years earlier . On `` For the Record '' , Streisand was wise to include outtakes , alternative versions and unreleased tracks from the music vaults . THAT 'S how you do a career retrospective ! ! ! Instead here , Diana 's fans have to put up with lousy songs and the waste of an entire disc space on Disc 4 . On some selections , you can even detect Diana 's own indifference towards the lackluster material.Berry Gordy also skimped on the sound quality . It 's mediocre at best . Again , it just shows lack of attention to detail and the basics . In 1993 when this retrospective was released , improvements were already being made on sound remastering technology as record companies were re-releasing classic CD 's with improved digital sound . Since `` Forever Diana 's '' release in 1993 , there have been Diana Ross and the Supremes compilations with much better sound , especially those released in the last 10 years since the early 2000 's . If Berry Gordy and Diana had decided to spend as much time on the sound quality as they did on the vanity project that went into the accompanying booklet , then maybe results would be much , much better in the sound department.If they ever decide to go back and release another Diana Ross career retrospective ( which does n't appear likely ) , they would have to re-think and re-do the entire song selection process ( especially filter out the Supremes stuff ) and go with the best digital Remastering for sound . They would also have to release classic tracks in their original entirety , not skimp to the single remix versions ( with `` Love Hangover '' `` Ai n't No Mountain High Enough '' as painful examples here ) . Her fans deserve much better treatment for sticking with this Diva for the past half century.Then again , the fans must be wondering , `` Why bother ? '' There are better Diana Ross two-disc collections out there with better sound , better selection of songs , so why bother with this lousy 4-disc compilation ? Too bad Diana Ross decided to call this career retrospective `` Forever Diana '' b/c the compilation does not stand the test of time nor deserve to be called `` Forever Diana '' . If she and Berry Gordy had decided to spend as much energy and time on the four discs as they did on the accompanying booklet ( a vanity project at best with self-serving photos of the Diva preening and posing in various guises ) , then maybe results would have been much different and better.Instead Berry Gordy decided to give Diana the reins to come up with a Vanity Project by sticking one too many needless , unnecessary tracks as fillers , especially on the last disc when they could 've come up with indeed material that was worth calling `` Forever Diana '' . Instead , the fans are saying : `` Forget It , Diana ! ''	-1
I 'll admit I 'm not a big Boys ll Men fan . Yet I got their first cd many years ago after a friend told me I was missing out and I was upset I wasted my money . All the songs sounded alike to me so I put it in a box and never looked at it again . Recently I went through that box and found this cd and put it on . I was surprised that some of the songs did n't sound so bad . The strong songs are `` Uhh Ahh '' , `` It 's So Hard To Say Goodbye '' , `` Under Pressure '' and of coarse `` Motown Philly '' which is the best song on the album.Those songs are the few high lights . When you take away those four songs the rest of the cd is still dry . It 's too sappy and the songs all sound the same . It sounds like they used the same beat on every song . While many are shocked B2M are no longer hot , I 'm not . I knew 20 years ago when they first started they were n't going to last . Their music was hot for the new jack swing era but when that trend faded so did they .	-1
I never liked this version of this album . It has too many extra songs that just did n't sound right to me . I love the original version of C.H.H . The one with the black and white cover and it has the men in the far background walking . I have that one in cassette and i 'm waiting for the CD to come in the mail .	-1
On CONVERSATION PEACE , the Wonder man tries too hard to please everybody . The hip-hop rhythms on `` The Edge Of Eternity '' , `` Rain Your Love Down '' , `` Cold Chill '' and the semi-acid jazz `` Sensuous Whisper '' sound forced and artificial , while message-oriented songs like `` Take The Time Out '' and the title track sound too preachy . `` Sorry '' and `` For Your Love '' are strictly album filler , while the lovely `` Taboo To Love '' , `` Treat Myself '' and the anti-gun `` My Love Is With You '' are the album 's highlights ( although those hip-hop rhythms pop up again on the latter song ) . For his next album , Stevie should just relax and be himself .	-1
Stevie Wonder is one of my All-Time Favorites Period.He is a Musical Genius.but This is n't his Genius here.Only two songs stand Out Sensuous Whisper & amp ; Cold CHill.His Writing is hurting on this DIsc.The Music is Lacking that Stevie Edge.After His Live Set I was Hyped for this Disc but it was n't Happening but you ca n't take away The Man 's Genius .	-1
Evolution was one of the most hyped albums back in 1997 my sophomore year of high school . Naturally I rushed out to get the album and on my first listen I found the album to be weak , especially the fast tracks . Seven years later I re-bought the album and gave it another listen ; as an adult I found the album to be stronger than I thought . Boyz II Men like Jodeci before them have always been the strongest with ballads and this is apparent on the singles Doin Just Fine , Never,4 Seasons Of Loneliness . Shawn 's writing skills were apparent on the song Doin Just Fine which is one of the strongest songs on the album , however there 's is a lot of weak material on the album . Songs such as Girl In The Life Magazine , Baby C'mon and To The Limit all seem forced and are n't song with that much heart . In my opinion truly evolved on their EXCELLENT fourth disc Nathan Michael Shawn Wanya .	-1

See , here 's the problem with Caribou : It is n't very good . There are hits , oh yes - what Elton album would be complete without hits ? Those are good . `` The B*tch is Back '' is a funny heavy rocker with a full brass section and is not sexist , unlike ... oh , I dunno , everything else Bernie Taupin ever wrote : the `` b*tch '' is the singer , you see . `` Do n't Let the Sun Go Down on Me '' , meanwhile , is one of Elton 's many classic love ballads with another one of those soaring refrains . `` Stinker '' is a rewrite of `` The B*tch is Back '' , but I do n't care - it 's a damn good time . And `` I 've Seen the Saucers '' is cool in its eeriness . On the other hand , I really wish Bernie Taupin would stop parodying country , since `` Dixie Lily '' just may be worse than `` No Shoestrings on Louise '' , which is an impressive feat ; `` Pinky '' and `` Grimbsy '' are yet more cheesy ballads ; `` You 're So Static '' is more unwarranted misogyny ; `` Ticking '' has no reason to exist ; `` Solar Prestige Whatever '' is a painful sequel to `` Sun King '' . Oh , and the cover image makes Captain Fantastic 's look like a Da Vinci .	-1
Of his 70s classic output , this LP is probably John 's weakest . Named after the studio where this was dashed off in the middle of a tour ( a little over a week of studio time ) , it 's obvious the stress was getting to Elton and Bernie . There simply are n't a whole lot of memorable songs here.The one most will know is ballad `` Do n't Let the Sun Go Down on me '' , one of the most enduring tunes in Elton 's canon . `` The Bitch is Back '' , while relatively slight , was a big hit for Elton as well . `` Ticking '' portrays an armed standoff that could have come from today 's newspaper clippings . After that , the good stuff is slim pickings . `` Pinky '' is pleasant enough , but alongside Elton 's other love songs clearly a lesser effort . `` Dixie Lily '' is an homage to a Mississippi riverboat . `` You 're so Static '' is `` Sweet Painted Lady '' part two.. '' I 've seen the Saucers '' is a nice look at life through the eyes of the folks who claim to have met with aliens . `` Grimsby '' is a heavily fictionalized look at an English seaside town.The nadir of the album and possibly Elton 's catalogue is `` Solar Prestige a Gammon '' . Yes , I understand that he wrote it to mock critics for `` reading too much '' into his lyrics . But when John Lennon did the same thing , he came up with `` I Am the Walrus '' and at least the wordplay was clever . `` Stinker '' is also pretty aptly named.As far as the bonus tracks go , you get a decent Christmas tune ( `` Step into Christmas '' ) that still gets holiday airplay Stateside , `` Pinball Wizard '' is the song from `` Tommy '' first done by the Who and probably should 've replaced `` Solar Prestige '' on the album . A good cover is better than a misbegotten original . `` Sick City '' is a jibe at New York City . Again , it 's better than a lot of the material on the album . `` Cold Highway '' was a B side to `` Bitch '' that also should 've made the cut instead of some of what did.In summary : Only completists will need to own this , but if you 're a pretty big Elton John fan it 's worth getting for `` Ticking '' and the bonus material . All others should go grazing elsewhere.2 1/2 stars	-1
The only reason to buy this CD is for `` I 've seen the saucers '' and `` Dont let the sun go down on me '' ... .in my personal opinion ... the only 2 songs worth listening to ... ..This album was a complete flop ... compared to the epic GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD and everything that preceeded it ... ..I think the falling out between Elton and Bernie contributed to its failure ... ... Elton is a great musician and performer but his song writing ability leaves alot to be desired .	-1
The 1974 album 'Caribou ' is a fairly enjoyable glossy pop-rock album . 'Caribou ' is not a bad album , but it is not a great one either.Admittedly , most of the songs are enjoyable while this piece is playing . 'Dixy Lily ' is a country / show boat tune that is fairly enjoyable , though , honestly , if I heard this on the radio , I probably would n't realise it was Elton , does n't sound like him . 'Solar Prestige a Gammon ' is better than you 've been told , it 's slightly jazzy , and Ray plays the Marimba 's beautifully . However , it 's hardly memorable . There 's a pair of ballads , the sickly sweet country-flavoured 'Pinky ' and the more psychedelic / sci-fi 'I 've seen the saucers ' , that sound so great as they start ( both have a nice bongo-drum flavoured beat ) , but they soon fail , despite the good arrangements and nice melodies . Even the jazzy rocker 'You 're so static ' , feels sloppy , though it is enjoyable.If there is a song I dig on this thing it 's 'Stinker ' , a funked up blues-rocker that has real rock 'n ' roll soul , mixed with English eccentricity and an hilarious lyric , as well as perfectly appropriate vocals from Elton . 'Do n't let the sun go down on me ' is a gorgeous and melodic ballad , not quite as heartfelt as it pretends , Elton sounds quite happy as he 's singing this song , but it 's still a very memorable song . It has a very rousing chorus and plenty of spine-tingling melodies . The choice of trumpets was a wonderful addition to the arrangement . 'Ticking ' also has great melodeis , a haunting ballad about a mass-shooting , but the song focuses more on the psychology of the young man with the gun . The melody is great and there are some hooks in it as well . 'The b* is back ' is a sly rocker that is performed at break-neck speed , but is still fun , though I personally prefer 'Grimsby ' I think it has a good , memorable chorus and is quite a fun song.So there is some good material , and most of the rest of it is enjoyable , but hardly memorable .	-1
I am blown away by the plethora of positive reviews and only one negative review . I gave each track only about 2 minutes til i quickly fast forwarded it to the next . What a sad sad sad excuse for an electronica album . This is truly the worst electronica album I have ever heard ... nothing but mundande noise stuff with gay voice overs that sounded like it was created by some 16 year olds in their basements ... .after scanning through the album in under 10 minutes I quickly tossed it to my garbage can..The only plus side its five tracks ... fortunately I got it used off of amazon for [ ... ] cents plus [ ... ] bucks shipping ... got it cuz a buddy suggested it and cuz of its absurd amount of 5 stars ... .id rate it lower if i could ... i wouldnt even call it an electronica genre cd ... ..needless to say i wont be buying any other albums for this sad xcuse of a band	-1
This should have had Livin ' in America ! ! ! That song would make it complete ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
you wan na feel the godfather buy the box set which includes 80 hardcore jams made by jb and his disciples of funk .	-1
James Brown : The Godfather of Soul , Soul Brother # 1 , the founder of funk , the father of Hip Hop ( having been sampled by nearly everyone ) , a cultural icon , and the Hardest Working Man in Show Business . Ai n't never gon na be another.20 ALL-TIME GREATEST HITS consists of 20 tracks . These are some of his biggest hits , presumably from the 1960s and 1970s , but such information is not provided in this collection . Booklet does not provide any information , other than songwriting credits , about the songs included in this collection . Sound quality is good.While the packaging is completely lacking , the songs are great . There 's `` I Got You ( I Feel Good ) '' , `` Papa 's Got a Brand New Bag '' , `` Hot Pants '' , `` Night Train '' , `` Cold Sweat '' , `` Sex Machine '' , the ballads `` Try Me '' and `` It 's a Man 's Man 's Man 's World '' , and my personal favorite , `` The Payback '' , in its 7+ minute version.Get this collection as a James Brown sampler only . This is not for fans looking for a comprehensive collection or a historical album.Music : 5 starsPackaging : 0 stars	-1
Judging by both of their collections of `` hits '' , the two of them produced some of the most annoying tunes of the 70s & 80s , and unfortunately , beyond . These two `` pretend '' rockers hit the radio with junk like `` Crocodile Rock '' ( John ) and `` Uptown Girl '' ( Joel ) , thus cementing their respective geek reputations . Yuck ! Neither Elton John nor Billy Joel have made anything authentic ; they are both fake rock and rollers with repertoires filled with lame tunes , making them like the male equivalents of Gloria Estefan or Madonna . Yuck ! Zero stars .	-1
Fraudulent `` rocker '' Elton continues on his journey to the land of Yuckville with yet another collection of the most `` worn out their welcome '' tunes ever to land radio play . Who in their right mind would put this on at home and listen to it , when you can turn on any classic rock or '80s nostalgia radio station and hear these tired tracks any time of day or night ? Boring boring boring .	-1
From the OBJECTIVE reviewer ... it 's hard to determine a rating on this box set because although it shows that Elton had great non-album tracks , the best stuff in this box has been added as bonus tracks to his albums . So you probably want to skip this in favor of buying the expanded editions of his early 70 's albums .	-1
Seriously , folks ... this band SUCKS ! Every one of these hits ( Dancing Queen , Sugar Sugar , Mamma Mia , Take a Chance on Me ) is dated , sugary , and awful as awful gets . How they scored any hits whatsoever is beyond me . KEEP AWAY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Track 19 `` Waterloo '' is corrupt . The first part has been cut and it jumps when the song starts . I contacted Customer Service and found out that it 's located in the Philipines ( according to the tech ) ; they could n't understand what I was saying about it being corrupt and insisted that the download failed . Playing it on the Amazon Cloud Player results in the same problem . I insisted on speaking to a manager who said she would take care of it and with a an hour I received and email saying the problem was fixed . But the problem was not fixed as of this writing .	-1
Howdy fellow muzik fanz ! I love listening to easy going music like the next guy but these ABBA folks are really starting to irritate me ! I was up at 3am the other night ( i have insomnia LOL ! ) and woke up to an infomercial of an old geezer trying to sell ABBA cd 's because they are supposedly 'one of the best ' Euro-Pop bands ever ... ha ! I fell for his trick and actually bought this album . What a complete disaster ! The vocal talent of the vocals in this band do n't even compare to the legends Lady Gaga and Nicki Minaj ! The instrumentals are just irritating ... why ca n't they include dubstep bass drops or lil wayne type hip hop beats ? ? ! Lastly , the lyrics are just awful ! `` money , money , money '' is a completely disturbing song about envious people who wish they had money ... trying to make the 1 % ers look bad ! Well guess what ABBA ? 1 % of the world owns 90 % of the wealth ... and they did it all legally ... ( I.e . Halliburton , Wallstreet , Oil Companies ) ... `` Dancing Queen '' is sooo lame.. they do n't shake their booties like the girls in 50 Cent videos ... ... . and `` Take a Chance on me '' is sooo cheesy ! I ca n't believe anyone would actually support these shams ! ! For good female vocalist ... stick with Nicki Minaj , Lady Gaga , Selena Gomez , Jessica Simpson , Britney Spears , and the ever so talented Milli Vanilli !	-1
aside from Dancing Queen & amp ; Fernando there was n't much to ABBA.formula Production & amp ; Music.catchy but forgettable for the most part .	-1
I for one am glad that the 70 's are over and even more estatic that bands like Abba no longer exist ... ... .Why the 2 stars instead of a one ? I feel sorry for them -- I mean they were sincere -- -they just stunk ... ..	-1
I have always enjoyed the Moody Blues having some vinyl and cd 's but all have been studio albums . This album can not be recommended as the recording is weak , very shallow and tinny . The vocals on this album are weak beyond belief . I thought this cd would capture an essence that studio recordings lack , however I wished I had not heard how weak vocally this band has become .	-1
Coming off the high and the worlwide acceptance of Yes I Am , I was a bit taked back with this album . It seemed a little fluffy and very overproduced . I just did not feel a connection with her on this one . I did however like a couple of the songs that were hits on the radio , but other than that , I was dissapointed . But even though Melissa may have missed on a couple albums altogether ( Breakdown and Your Little Secret , you could never walk away from a Melissa concert without being inspired .	-1
I have always had a soft-spot for 80s rock . I grew up on Van Halen , Motley Crue , Poison , Def Leopard , RATT , Skid Row , etc . So you 'd think I 'd love Bon Jovi , right ? Wrong ! I have always hated Bon Jovi.I actually think they are a talented band . Ritchie Sambora is a talented player and can definitely write catchy riffs and solo . The rest of the band is competent enough . I think Bon Jovi had the potential to be a good band . So , what is my main problem with them ? First , although the band has written some catchy songs-the band , along with Desmond Child ( who is the kiss of death to anything cool ) finds a way to ruin it ; by making it overly glossy , radio-friendly and assessable . Bon Jovi 's music is completely wimpy and lightweight and lacks any real substance.Second , I utterly hate Jon Bon Jovi . He has a good voice , I 'll give him that . But he is a lightweight , candy-ass who is n't a tenth as good as Diamond David Lee Roth or Axl Rose , or even Vince Neil or Brett Michaels.Bon Jovi 's music is corporate pap aimed at 12 year-old girls . If you want to get into some good 80s rock-pick up Guns N ' Roses `` Appetite For Destruction , '' Van Halen 's `` 1984 '' or Motley Crue 's `` Shout at the Devil . '' If you must buy a Bon Jovi album ( and stink up your collection ) then buy this .	-1
i just ca n't believe how this band ripped me off . many people and the band themselves claimed to be 'hair metal ' . nothing could be further from the truth . it would be impossible to call these guys rock , let alone metal . just because they dressed like motley crue and poison did n't mean they could ever amount to what the previous bands had . these square idiots predented to be heavy metal just to cash in on the late-80 's hair metal movement . stay away from this piece of fake rock . a word of warning : THIS IS POP , NOT ROCK .	-1
`` He was an idol then , now he 's an idol here . But his face has changed..He 's not the same no more..And I have to say that I like the way his music sounded before . '' ( E.John-B.Taupin 1976 )	-1
Elton is a great artist , a real one . He made fantastic album in the 70'sand in the 80 's , but good things never last forever . I think he did great stuff but his star has faded . This album is n't great but Elton still is .	-1
For the inordinately curious.The Grant Green album is far superior to the Donald Byrd session , which is n't saying a whole lot .	-1
`` Crocodile Rock '' is surely one of the most annoying tunes ever to hit the radio , and it is the main hit on this album . OK , `` Daniel '' was also a hit , and is tolerable , but the rest of this album reeks . Elton John is vastly overrated .	-1
I 'm sorry , but this album is horrible . The drastic drop in quality from the brilliant , affecting & quot ; Honky Chateau & quot ; LP makes it clear , in retrospect , that this is where Elton made the tacky transition from & quot ; Artist & quot ; to & quot ; Entertainer & quot ; . Sure , & quot ; Daniel & quot ; still sounds great ; but & quot ; Have Mercy on the Criminal & quot ; is just horrid , and & quot ; Midnight Creeper & quot ; is quite possibly the most embarrassing Rolling Stones imitation of all-time . And the rest just reeks of early-70s tackiness -- all dressed up in baby blue polyester suits with nowhere to go ... .	-1
This is where it all started..well , if you do n't count & quot ; Empty Sky & quot ; . I love Elton John 's music , I have for a long time , and this album is essential , but it 's not one of my favorites.. & quot ; Your Song & quot ; is still a nice touch , while & quot ; I Need You To Turn To & quot ; scores more points ( check out the & quot ; Live In Australia & quot ; version ) , but & quot ; Take Me To The Pilot & quot ; , this version of it is pretty horrid . It does n't sound as catchy as it would on different live releases . & quot ; No Shoe Strings On Louise & quot ; is one of the better songs on here , with a definite Stones influence ; & quot ; First Episode At Hienton & quot ; makes me feel like jumping out of a window ; & quot ; Sixty Years On & quot ; , while not a terrible song , the strings are too much at times ; & quot ; Border Song & quot ; , again , sounds better live ; & quot ; Greatest Discovery & quot ; , a touching song , but one I do n't find myself indulging in too much , & quot ; The Cage & quot ; , filler ; & quot ; The King Must Die & quot ; , there is something somewhat moving about this one , but it is still overblown . As for the bonus tracks , & quot ; Bad Side Of The Moon & quot ; is overproduced ; & quot ; Grey Seal & quot ; , I kinda like it , though I ca n't tell you why ; & quot ; Rock N'Roll Madonna & quot ; is a catchy , Jerry Lee Lewis type rocker . To sum it all up , I think all of Elton 's & quot ; Classic Years & quot ; albums are worth having , including this one , but this is my least favorite , with the possible exceptions of & quot ; Caribou & quot ; and & quot ; Empty Sky & quot ; . I think the strings present the biggest problem on this album..just overly dramatic in a lot of places , and a little hollow at times as well . If you want to hear the strings put to good use , check out & quot ; Madman Across The Water & quot ; .	-1
`` I looked up/And saw the empty sky/If I could only/Could only fly ... '' If Elton only knew what was to come.The first Elton John , though only released in the U.S. in the mid-70s , after his run of big singles was beginning to dry up , has a feeling more of cleaning up after the elephants as much as it does of leading the parade . Elton 's voice , in the notable title track , the best song on the original track lineup , sounds as world-weary as it would on `` Blue Moves , '' recorded some seven years later . The lyrics of ES are less sharp than usual , though the subjects are less the broken relationships Bernie Taupin came to write about so obsessively later in his career , and more in line with pre-teen daydreaming about Norse gods and escape . Maturation was still to come , along with the pop chops and chart-topping savvy.There 's nothing great on this collection to recommend it to a non-completist , it 's a little too proggy and twee . That said , a casual fan will find worthwhile things . The melodies are pretty if unmemorable , with songs like `` The Scaffold '' and `` Western Ford Gateway '' standouts on the hummability meter . How 's this for an unusual complaint for a pop record : Too much harpsichord ! The song `` Empty Sky '' is the major revelation , because it really showcases a different Elton than we saw performing `` Your Song '' the following year . It 's an interesting peek at the artist behind the showman , just following his muse and trying to figure out what works , and the crunchy guitar licks are pretty sensational , though the song never quite gels in the way of a `` Philadelphia Freedom '' or `` Benny And The Jets . `` The best song on the CD is not from the original album , but `` Lady Samantha , '' which when released as a single some months before gave Elton his first ( minor ) radio success . That churns and burns in Elton 's characteristically pleasing manner.If you like Elton a lot , you will like `` Empty Sky . '' If you listen to his Greatest Hits packages once in a while and want to dig deeper , you might start with something more like `` Captain Fantastic '' or `` Tumbleweed Connection . '' This is a good recording , tarnished only by the fact its maker ( s ) would go on to do a lot better .	-1
Well , this is where it all really started . & quot ; Empty Sky & quot ; , 1969..If I could , I would would give this album another half star , because though it is lacking , there is still something rather charming , and enjoyable about it . At first , I listened to this album very little , and was n't impressed , but all the sudden , I would be in class , or doing whatever , and I would have & quot ; Val-Hala & quot ; stuck in my head , a very haunting song . The title track is probably my favorite , I 'm surpised it does n't get classic rock airplay , or performed live . & quot ; Western Ford Gateway & quot ; is a catchy one , along with & quot ; Sails & quot ; ( watch out for the lyrics on that one , though ) . & quot ; Skyline Pigeon & quot ; is a great song , but I am more partial to the versions on & quot ; Here And There & quot ; , or & quot ; Rare Masters & quot ; , and why oh why , did it have to be about a pigeon ... One thing that I do n't understand about this album , why was there a non-album single , & quot ; It 's Me That You Need & quot ; , released right before , but not included on the lp ? There for , the album has no singles , this never really made any sense to me . Overall , I would say this is a decent , experimental album , a little rough around the edges , but any true fan has to hear where it all started .	-1
First off , I am an EJ fan . I own everything he 's recorded . Nevertheless , I also try and be objective and this review is more for the casual/beginning fan who may not be familiar with Elton 's entire catalog . That said , Empty Sky is very much an album for Elton enthusiasts . It 's a sort of curio piece ( or artifact ) that only rabid EJ fans will find listenable . In truth , Empty Sky 's only value is the glimpse it shows listeners of Elton 's origins . Skyline Pigeon , is the one worthy track on this thing . From failed psycadelia ( Empty Sky ) to dull , cheerless , false antiquity ( Valhalla , the Scaffold ) , this is an effort that reflects the times ( late 60 's ) and Elton 's attempt to compete with all of the other once popular ( and now utterly forgotten ) & quot ; time capsule & quot ; , mock-atmospheric oddities such as Procol Harum or the Moody Blues . Elton was very much trying to find himself , musically , and he had n't yet realized his true gift : the ability to pen unbelievably catchy pop songs .	-1
From the OBJECTIVE reviewer ... this is Elton 's first album and it 's rough around the edges . A good producer could have improved this project and there are a couple of decent tracks including the title song .	-1
After a number of years with Bluesology and some moderately successful singles with lyricist Bernie Taupin , Dick James Music decided to give Elton the chance to record his own album.Because it was 1969 , this album is fraught with needless elements of psychadelia and overt experimentation . Moroever , even the remastered version of the album is incapable of covering up the poor production quality of this `` master work '' . `` Empty Sky '' plods along for well over 8 minutes until it ends with this silly fade-out and fade-in during which Elton provides some `` grooooovy '' overdubs . You really have to LOVE the harpsichord to like `` Val Hala '' . Beyond that , the album reads as an instruction manual on how to play the recorder . `` Skyline Pigeon '' is the great song of this album , and even so , this version if far inferior to the versions on `` Rare Masters '' or `` Here or There '' . Elton 's voice is whiney and nasal ; the harpsichord , omnipresent . I will give an honorable mention here to `` Western Ford Gateway '' which is a really good , catchy tune which struggles to get noticed amidst all the experimental debris surrouding it.Just when you think Elton is going to put out a good song with the grave and serious `` Gulliver '' , it suddenly jettisons into come fruity jazz number `` It 's Hay Chewed '' . Then , the `` Reprise '' is nothing more than a fragment of each song on the album meshed into a minute ... blah ! The bonus tracks like `` Lady Samantha '' and `` It 's Me That You Need '' are mere footnotes in Elton 's catalog and provide the listener with little consolation after having endured an otherwise dreadful album.I would seriously skip this album .	-1
If it werent for the 3 add on songs it would be 1 star , nice to sleep to though	-1
I ca n't stand this guy 's music ! I admit I bought his albums up to 1974 , but got rid of them shortly thereafter , and never heard them again , mainly because they were all over the radio all the time , and I got sick and tired of hearing Elton 's flat vocals and Bernie Taupin 's stupid lyrics . Can you tell I 'm not a fan ?	-1
Okay , people tend to overrate this one and I 'm not sure why . I think it has to do with the legendary , almost mythic , status of EJ circa 1970 , wowing 'em at the Troubadour in L.A . Thus , this live album is supposed to be evidence of his ivory-pounding roots . But live albums have always tended to be product ( like Greatest Hits albums ) and this one 's disappointing because it catches Elton on a bad night and reveals , perhaps , his biggest problem as a live performer : his penchant to get a ridiculously smarmy ( see his embarrassing MTV unplugged performance for proof ) . Instead of simply performing his songs and letting the compositions stand on their own , Elton tends to go over-the-top . His vocal antics on Honky Tonk Women are flat-out silly , and why would he ruin Burn Down The Mission by turning it into a medley ? Throw in the fact that Elton and his band do n't sound in top form ( nor rhythm ) and I 'm ready to move on to Dylan 's Before the Flood or Warren Zevon 's Stand in the Fire , two truly outstanding live albums .	-1
I really really really tried to like this album but it just does n't do much for me . The songs are mediocre and the performances do n't sound that great ( much like Leon Russel Live ) . He tries hard but too much yelling and piano bashing , and the end result is mediocre at best and annoying . Do not reommend this one .	-1
Tumbleweed Connection raised Elton to his initial peak audibly with the hit single Country Comfort , and that legendary epic , Burn down the mission . It was the energy of that album that inspired the recording of 11-17-70 , Live at the ANR Studios in New York City . In reality , this album was nothing but one long horrible noise . John 's talents were wasted , with his vocals drowned in layers of instruments , which unfortunately destroyed the albums ambience . The eighteen minute version of burn down the mission became panned out to the point of very overdone . As much as I love listening to Elton 's Music , this album was a rapid fall to failure . The modestly improved & quot ; madman across the water & quot ; and & quot ; Honky chateau & quot ; , were released in 1971 and 1972 respectively . but it would be the release of & quot ; Do n't shoot me , I 'm only the piano player & quot ; , and & quot ; Good-bye yellow brick road & quot ; in 1973 , that would bring him back to his audible peak , and steer him well clear of this brief trench in his career .	-1
This live album was only mediocre . Buy the studio versions . Some of the tunes on this go on and on until you have to move onto the next track .	-1
From the OBJECTIVE reviewer ... Elton live is rarely a good thing . This CD is no exception and if it were n't for his better than average version of `` Take Me To the Pilot '' this would n't even get 2 stars .	-1
It is amazing how quickly Elton fell from the heights of great pop music ( Goodbye Yellow Brick Road ) to the depths of this garbage . Totally unlistenable - and it does not get much better for a long long time .	-1
Ok , maybe I am wrong but this is for me the worst Elton 's album . The songs are not catchy . Someone said here that Elton 's tank runs out of gas . And that is true . GYBR is great album and also Caribou and other albums from 70'es but this just is n't . Only good song here is Island girl ( that is something like Crocodile rock ) . Dan Dare sounds like ugly interpretation but it 's funny.In all this rock songs there are not even a good song like Pinball Wizard or Saturday ... ! Only good thing is that this is Elton 's last album with songs like here . I do n't want even to imagine how will be sounded Rock of the Westies ( part two ) . I know that almost no one will be agree with me but do n't shoot me , I am just a guy with my opinion !	-1
This was a disappointment but it did turn up a few gems . `` Billy Bones and the White Bird '' was a great rocker with thundering drums , a must-have for any Elton John fan . `` Island Girl '' was a textbook Elton John single for that era , and `` I Feel Like A Bullet In The Gun Of Robert Ford '' was a first class Elton John ballad ; do n't settle for live versions of the song that appear on compilations . Of the remaining six songs only `` Feed Me '' would be worth downloading.Imagine the shock of hearing an album open with not one but two awful songs before rolling into the single . This had been unheard of for an Elton John album up to that point . `` Grow Some Funk Of Your Own '' was a grade Z single at the time and in retrospect is better left forgotten.The few memorable songs make this the last hurrah of Elton 's seventies classics . One ca n't hold his subsequent recording history against him too much though given the string of great music he gave us in the early to mid-seventies .	-1
From the OBJECTIVE reviewer ... This is Elton 's transition album into his worse musical period . The difference between this and his next release `` Blue Moves '' is we do n't have to tolerate his mistakes through two CDs ! `` Grow Some Funk of Your Own '' is another classic Elton song and the last great song for the rest of the decade .	-1
So it 's late 1975 . Elton 's previous 6 albums have soared to number one : the last one , `` Captain Fantastic '' actually entering the charts at number one , a feat then previously unheard of . Elton is playing on the Muppet Show , getting his star on Hollywood Blvd. , and filling out Dodger Stadium in L.A. for two nights straight . `` Philadelphia Freedom '' goes to # 1 and his portrayal of the Pinball Wizard in the Who 's `` Tommy '' dominates the movie . Elton is the biggest rock star on the planet and can seemingly do no wrong . Predictably , when `` Rock of the Westies '' is released , it , like its predecessor , enters the chart at number one ... But Elton 's life is in turmoil . He is depressed and drinking . He dives into a swimming pool after taking an OD of sleeping pills in a failed suicide attempt ... with his mother present ! The sycophants around him convince him of his infallibility . This album , from its unintelligible jokes in the liner notes , to its goofy feel overall , are the testament of an burnt-out artist in pain.Unlike previous albums , where Elton and Bernie would allow themselves one `` silly '' song ... almost all the songs on this album are clownish . With Dee Murray and Nigel Olson gone , Elton 's new band injects his music with a harder rock sound , but the inherent silliness in the lyrics spills over badly . The `` Medley '' in the beginning complains of an ugly big woman down in New Orleans . Similarly , the protagonist of the # 1 hit `` Island Girl '' is black , island woman standing 6'3 '' who could drive her nails into you like a rake ... '' Dan Dare '' , finds Elton returning to the theme of space travel , only this time , rather than the thoughtful `` Rocketman '' , we get frenetic piano playing and Elton 's barking noises.The drivel just does not stop . An otherwise superb production effort by Gus Dudgeon is ruined by Elton/Bernie 's buffoonery as they relate songs about a bar fight in a Mexican cantina , a fight between an overworked married couple and the simply incoherent `` Billy Bones '' which takes us from the decks of a stormweathered ship to the flash and pazazz of some rock star 's entrance on stage ... '' Street Kids '' is the only discernible song with any punch here . `` I Feel Like a Bullet '' is the hit Elton tried to push on fans following `` Island Girl '' though it never took off , and its obvious why . While Davey Johnstone 's guitar work is beautiful , and Elton 's falsetto impressive , the song is just too sappy.The remastered version has a beautiful song called `` Sugar on the Floor '' . Elton is alone at his piano : all of the silliness gone . His singing is sorrowful and pleading . It is the most honest track on the album .	-1
First Band on the Moon by The Cardigans had the potential to be a great pop album but there are only 2 good tracks , Lovefool and Been It . Most of the time I do n't care for the songs that were huge hits but the rest of the songs are boring and lifeless . The Cardigans have a great sound but too bad they could n't churn out timeless songs .	-1
Lovefool song on this album was good , the rest were just crap , in my ( clearly not so humble ) opinion . To me , this was a one-hit-wonder band .	-1
Cardigans ` third record is , well , not all that different from their previous ones . This time the lyrics get a little darker and cynical at parts , although the songs remain poppy , acessible , and , unfortunately , a bit forgettable . This is easy listening , which isn ` t too bad but it ` s not that exciting either and becomes a somewhat repetitive album . This meld of pop , lounge and kitsch is mildly entertaining but & igrave ; sn ` t enough to make a solid record . Still , there are some good songs here , like the pretty & quot ; The Great Divide & quot ; or the catchy & quot ; Been It & quot ; , even if the rest ends up sounding the same . Cute and listenable , but that ` s it . The bands ` next release , & quot ; Gran Turismo & quot ; , is a more consistent and ambitious offering , stepping in a new and darker direction .	-1
I gave the Scorps one more chance after the major disappointment of Animal Magnetism , & I 'll tell ya , disappointment went to utter disgust , with the music & lyrics going backwards & gettin ' more immature than ever , but good for the intended 12-14 yr-old market . I said 'goodbye ' to the Scorps then and only listened to Lovedrive & all the ones before ... .-then awhile later , I heard `` Rock you like a herd-of-cans '' on the radio & it only cemented my belief that they sold out to commercialism & the big bucks , with any serious hard-rock songwriting tossed aside -- oh , well , at least they got the big bucks ! ( but not anymore of mine )	-1
Come On Over by Shania Twain sold millions and millions of albums but I despise this cd with a passion . Shania is one of the worst singer-songwriters I have ever heard , especially in the genre of country/pop . Her voice is completely unoriginal , there 's no fire , range , or accessiblility . I ca n't believe how truly awful her songwriting is ! Terrible cliches , junior high filled lyrics and child-like melodies . Songs like That Do n't Impress Me Much , Man I Feel Like a Woman ! , Do n't Be Stupid , and You 're Still the One just gives me the willies . The only two tracks that have any emotion in them are From This Moment On and You 've Got a Way . Come on Over is a horrible and silliest record of the '90s . Stay clear from this over-rated mess !	-1
This CD is only good after three listens . The lyrical content is very shallow and baseless . The Woman In Me was great , but was dearly disappointed with this . I compare it to leaving the bottle cap of the soda opened too long : it goes stale.When a CD gets this kind of hype and have no content , we all know it is a fad and in five years will be forgotten. & quot ; Honey , I 'm Home & quot ; gets grating on the ears . The song does n't even try to stay county , except with some synthesized fiddles . And the & quot ; remix & quot ; CD , if you can call it that is even worse . Shania has sold out to become a part of the pop world.I only like & quot ; You 're Still The One & quot ; and & quot ; From This Moment On & quot ; . Shania should go back to her country roots and give up this pop trip of hers.I ca n't wait to see real country back because this & quot ; New Country & quot ; is starting to sound more like mainstream pop .	-1
she 's lucky she 's such a fox , that 's all i have to say . no way an average looking person gets away with songs like & quot ; Man ! I Feel Like a Woman. & quot ; I gave her a 5 for looks and a negative 1 for music , weighted equally that comes out to 2 stars .	-1
I think this is a very over-rated artist getting by , for the most part , on her looks . Many of her songs are based on the same heavy beat , reminiscent of Queen 's & quot ; We Will Rock You & quot ; , so they sound the same . Also , her lyrics are usually silly & amp ; superficial ( & quot ; Man ! I Feel Like a Woman & quot ; , & quot ; That Do n't Impress Me Much & quot ; , & quot ; Rock This Country & quot ; ... ) . Her first CD ( before she started writing her own material ) was her best .	-1
Well , let 's not deny the impact Shania Twain 's looks have on record sales . Twain is absolutely one of the most beautiful women I 've seen and she can also sing - that 's good but not essential for success . `` Come on over '' is mainly country-pop of rather harmless character and songs like `` Man I feel like a woman '' and `` Do n't be stupid '' is alright . The big hit `` That do n't impress me much '' , which by the way is n't sounding anything like country is a great song , but the rest of the material is very mediocre . I guess country music as a genre were in need of something to still be appealing , but I doubt this commercialization is the right way to go . To me it sounds a bit lifeless and without soul . I put my hope to the likes of Steve Earle and Jayhawks instead .	-1
what is so special about Shania Twain ? she is a country Jennifer Lopez.all hype and no talent.Lee ann Rimes is a better vocalist but when she tried to go pop all Hell broke out.Shania is pop.her songs and material have more in common with celine dion than Patsy Cline.that do n't impress me much is as pop as addicted to Love.she is great at marketing but her music has no roots.Still the one was catchy as is the case with some of her other material but considering her overall impact she is way overrated & amp ; overplayed .	-1
The whole Shania Twain phenomenon is still something that escapes me . Her musical success is confusing . Shania Twain is not really all that talented . To call her a country singer is an insult to true country singers . She is a Canadian pop singer whose pop music appeal was n't strong enough to make it in the U.S. market . So , she was repackaged as a 'country ' star in order to find a niche for her where she could sell some albums . The result is dreck like & quot ; Come on Over & quot ; & quot ; Come on Over & quot ; does n't sound remotely country , other than a few guitar twangs , and it does n't come close to sounding like good music . The ballads she sings are so bland and boring that I feel I 'm in danger of falling asleep anytime they come on the radio . & quot ; Still the One & quot ; and & quot ; From this Moment & quot ; are classic examples of how unoriginal and unappealing her ballads are . With her faster , more upbeat songs , it gets even worse . Rhythm , lyrical structure , and sophisticated lyrics are in absence here . & quot ; That Do n't Impress Me Much & quot ; is an embarrassment along these lines . Absolutely no rhythm exists and with lyrics like 'ok , so you 're a rocket scientist ... that do n't impress me much ' one ca n't help but wonder if this was a 6th grader writing these lyrics . & quot ; Man I Feel like a woman & quot ; seems like just an excuse for her to go 'whoo ' 'whoo ' every 30 seconds.It 's a sad state of affairs where these days where the music industry has become so geared to homogenized , pop-friendly music that albums like the ones Shania Twain puts out become huge hits , but daring , original music falls by the wayside . I fear the days of exceptional music are fast ending , and & quot ; Come On Over & quot ; is just one more example of that trend .	-1
After this CD came out i bought it , and i listend to it for a while , why i do n't know ? it had some cathy songs , yes , it has some fun songs , sure , but i really hate her voice . at first it 's fine to listen to her voice and she 's a good songwriter and seem to have a great personality , that i 'll give her , but in the longrun , her voice is very harsh on the ears ... i suggest you listen through one of her cd BEFORE you buy it ... cause her voice might not be as appealing to everyone ...	-1
It 's no secret that Shania is n't really country . Infact , she tries to be just about everything besidescountry . She done like alot of artist do ... Start outinnocent , then as time goes along she sells out moreand more to please the masses.What is it ? It 's production and marketing . I mean , ifyou are going to sell out why not try and reach outto everybody ? She comes with the ballads , a few slightrockers , pop songs ... Just about everything . She evencomes out with the international version ( which is theone I have ) that sounds at times like dance music.She 's like a new version of Madonna to be honest . Youca n't say she 's ALL bad ... But alot of her seems tobe about the attention and money . I bought into itwhen I was younger and I 'll admit that ... but about5 years ago my tastes started changing and `` artists '' like Shania pushed me to soul music . It 's somethingthat Shania really does n't have alot of.If I had to say which tracks on this album are thebest I 'd go with : You 've Got A Way and Rock ThisCountry ! and From This Moment On . The rest is prettymuch just catchy and cheap pop songs . Her secondalbum `` The Woman In Me '' is actually the betteralbum than this one .	-1
I will admit ... I purchased this CD ( albeit for $ 2.50 at the local used CD store ) , because I did like a couple of the singles on it . However , when putting this CD on and listening all the way through , one soon realizes that every song sounds just about the same ( okay , okay ... the fast ones sound like the other fast ones , the slow ones ... well , you get it ) . As I quickly tired of hearing the one or two catchy songs on the radio ( over and over and over ) , I have since traded this one back in to the store.If you like country , stick to Reba or Martina ... they wo n't soon be yesterday 's newspapers . And if you like pop ... there are far better artists out there who are making lasting music ( even Britney will be around long after Shania fades ) . And of course , if you just MUST buy this CD ... at least wait until one of the many millions shows up used at a store near you for a couple bucks . That way , when you come to the same conclusion I did , you wo n't be out much .	-1
I thought this cd was so wack , that I had to check the cd package to see if this was really Brian McKnight doing the performing on this cd . First off the rip-off jobs he was doing on songs as title track ( sounds like the riff to Outside Your Door by , Me'Shell Ndegeocello ) and the track The Only One For Me ( stealing the riff to the R Kelly remix of I Ca n't Sleep Baby , yall know what I 'm talking about ) . You Should Be Mine was another let down . And what 's up with Jam Knock ? I wish artist like Brian would stick to what they know instead of listening to their A & amp ; R reps . I guess I 'll just stick to the first two cd 's he released . By the way those uptempo cuts on the first two cd 's are way better than the crappy ones he 's got on the new one . I just ca n't recommend this to anyone . As a matter of fact , I 'm giving him two stars based on his past performances and hoping for a better outing next cd.Peace Xes Cainam	-1
Nothing new , still too cool for his own good.You 'd never know `` Back At One '' was only two years away .	-1
There are worse albums in Elton John 's catalogs than 1998 's `` The Big Picture '' - I 've already reviewed several of them . However , while it does n't quite sink to the level of `` Leather Jackets '' or `` Victim of Love , '' `` The Big Picture '' is Elton ( and Bernie Taupin ) at his most generic and uninspired.Unlike those previous efforts , there 's no real underlying factor ( drug abuse , attempting to stay relevant ) to why `` The Big Picture '' is a subpar effort . It 's not terrible , and it 's certainly more listenable than the other two atrocities I listed ( not to mention superior to `` A Single Man '' and perhaps `` Ice on Fire '' ) , but it suffers from a combination of maudlin lyrics and uninspired melodies and syrupy arrangements that do little to distinguish one track from the other . Several really good songs ( `` Recover Your Soul , '' `` Live Like Horses , '' `` Wicked Dreams '' ) lose their potential due to being smothered by garish , overbearing electronic arrangements that overshadow their more organic elements.The album 's best remembered track , the mega-hit `` Something About the Way You Look Tonight , '' ( the lead track on the double-single that brought forth the all-time bestselling `` Candle in the Wind 1997 '' ) , is trite lyrically but is sold by Elton 's passionate vocal and a subtler arrangement than the rest of the tracks . Do n't get me wrong , it 's certainly bombastic , but not nearly as bad as some of the other tracks here . `` The Big Picture '' is not a classic by any means , and is undoubtedly one of Elton 's weakest efforts .	-1
First of all , The Big Picture is n't a bad album . It 's just not what one would of hoped it would be . This album is a disappointment . Especially coming off a string of good albums like `` Sleeping With The Past '' , `` The One '' , `` Made In England '' , and the greatest ballad hits collection , `` Love Songs '' . This album is fairly low tempo . There are a few mid tempo songs , but not many . That 's alright . It 's just the low tempo ones are a little too long and unmemorable . There are high points . `` Something About The Way You Look Tonight '' , `` The Big Picture '' , `` Wicked Dreams '' , `` If The River Can Bend '' , `` Love 's Got A Lot To Answer For '' , are the high points . The rest are n't bad , they just do n't seem to hit the right notes . Elton , by the way , sounds great . He always does . This was just a disappointment . Not that great . Could of been so much better .	-1
This album is depressing . After the astonishing comeback and return to form of 'Made in England ' this album was a big let-down for me . All the songs sound like they were made with an Elton John songwriting program , there are n't any interesting melodies or modulations , the arrangements are uninteresting , underplayed , and by-the-book , and even his voice , which can lend viability to substandard fare , sounds detached and bored . Except in the hit , `` Something about the way you Look tonight '' , where he sings with a bit of REAL soul . That 's why the album actually deserves one star , it is a good song in his finest tradition . To be fair , he lost a number of friends in distressing circumstances in the period this album was made ( putting it mildly ) , the album seems to have a mournful underlying mood , when there 's any mood at all .	-1
The Big Picture for me was as a step down from the achievements of the previous release , Made In England . The main problem is the over production by Chris Thomas who gives these songs a dense , wall of sound production that drains the melodies dry . The songs themselves however are not that bad . In fact , it 's a shame that several did n't escape to surface on a future album . Opening with Long Way From Hapiness , it 's a fitting opener in lieu of Elton 's recent personal tragedies , the death of Princess Diana and his good friend , Gianni Versace - though the album was recorded prior to those events in the summer of 1997.Taupin returns for another round of lyrics that are his least ambitious in recent memory . Partly based on a loose concept of writing big old time ballads that the likes of Sinatra would sing , the album never quites hits it mark . Most are too simplistic and lack his unique narrative to tell what amounts to basic love stories . Love 's Got A Lot To Answer For is perhaps the best example of this : `` love 's got a lot to answer for , I just ca n't sleep with this feeling anymore '' .Others like , Something About The Way You Look Tonight , which appears to be a grand attempt at a classic ballad , only succeeds due to Elton 's powerful delivery . The melody and lyric however are routine at best.And that 's the problem with the rest . Live Like Horses is a powerful ballad about the death of Taupin 's father but is mired by an over use of synthesizers and unnecessary effects ( if you ever heard this solo , it 's a great song ) . Meanwhile , The End Will Come and I Ca n't Steer My Heart Clear of You simply do n't go anywhere . Most of these songs are slow to mid-tempo with the only real upbeat song being the closer Wicked Dreams . That one , while probably the most interesting lyric , simply never excels into what could have been a great rock song . It 's just simmers , never boils.But all is not lost here . If The River Can Bend is a wonderful gospel rave-up with a fantastic piano solo . January has a melody that changes and shifts dramatically along side one of Taupin 's most romantic lyrics . The title track also has some nice moments , including a wonderful opening of just Elton and piano.As you can see , I struggle with Elton 's albums where I 'm torn . I just ca n't outright not like it because there are some great songs here and Elton sings with great passion throughout.My biggest complaint is the production . It would make a great bookend to The One , another over produced album . But this was five years since The One and Chris Thomas brought nothing new to the table for Elton and these songs . Elton and Thomas had disagreements during the recording according to a recent biography by David Buckley and Taupin complained that the album sounded cold and too technical.The Big Picture falls squarely in the middle of pack of Elton 's albums . And for me , that 's frustrating.Best Tracks : Live Like Horses , If The River Can Bend , January , The Big Picture and Something About The Way You Look Tonight .	-1
For me , this is just a British singer with a bunch of good songs , but let 's not fool ourselves with this one . THIS IS NOT ELTON JOHN ! ! I mean , which is the best song here ? ? `` Recover your Soul '' ? , `` The Big Picture '' ? And what about the 80 % of the album ? ? Believe me , I am one of the most devoted EJ fans from Venezuela , but I have to tell you that this record is depressing ! ! Even `` Leather Jackets '' is a masterpiece compared to this one ! ! Sorry ... .	-1
This Elton John release just is not up to par by any means . Yes there are some `` good '' songs : Long Way From Happiness , Love Like Horses , Something In The Way You Look Tonight , and The Big Picture . These songs are indeed well crafted . However , they fall a bit short of the best of Elton 's Classic 70 's period as well as from other top releases like The One and Made In England.The remaining tracks are n't terrible per say . However , they just drag on and on without having anything meaningful to say . Coupled with the fact that most of them are over five minutes long , its a real chore to listen to this CD in one sitting.Furthermore , the pacing and stylings of the record are limited . Way too many ballads and mid tempo pieces that lack excitement and verve . On top of that , the arrangements are so identical . Must every piece have a synthesizer string arrangement ? Elton 's trademark keyboard runs just are n't present enough in the overall mix . Yes there are some good solos , but once the solo is finished Elton 's piano playing more often than not falls into the background behind the strings . The guitar , bass , and drums do n't do anything exciting on any of the tracks.A few good songs here and there , but I would recommend passing on this collection .	-1
Maybe , as another reviewer noted , Elton was going through a difficult time when recording this album . Or maybe he 'd been devoting the majority of his time working on songs for Aida and El Dorado ( both projects , according to EJ , were five years in the making ) . Whatever the case , this John/Taupin effort is awfully lukewarm . I was n't particularly fond of Made in England ( sappy self-help songs ) , but at least that record sounded like EJ put effort into it . The Big Picture however has the feel of product -- the perfunctory Elton/Bernie release to keep their giant wheel turning . It 's also not a good sign when the only bonafide hit off this thing , Something About The Way You Look Tonight , is a weak single . Like Healing Hands or You Got ta Love Someone , Something is soft-rock , adult-comtemporary complacency . The song does have wonderful , soulful verses , but the chorus is dull and cliched . The two best songs on this CD are Long Way From Happiness and Recover Your Soul , but neither are classic EJ cuts . Long Way is especially burdened ( as is the whole album ) with drum machines and grandiose electric keyboards . Gosh , how wonderful this song would have been if Elton had recorded it entirely with his piano.In fairness , though , the production is top-notch and Elton 's singing does sound strong . Now middle-aged , it seems Elton 's songwriting skills have dropped but his sense of how to use his voice have improved . Nevertheless , I 'd recommend passing this album by ( or , at worst , purchasing it VERY cheap online ) . Oddly , I recommend The Road to El Dorado , a soundtrack that features EJ 's best work since the early 80 's	-1
I 've been an E.J . fanatic for a long time . I 've owned everything he 's put out with the exception of Victim Of Love ( I think I can be forgiven for that ) . I find this this album to be adult contemporary elevator music at it 's worst . I wanted so much to love this album -- -and I tried -- -I really tried.Yes , the single , `` Something About The Way ... '' is catchy and is the saving grace of this album . Another great song is the haunting , `` Long Way From Happiness . '' Other than that though , I find this work completly forgetable . It is nowhere NEAR the same league as some of his earlier releases like `` Goodbye Yellow Brick Road '' or `` Honky Chateau . `` Luckily , from his next album releases , `` Songs From The West Coast '' , `` Peachtree Road '' , and now `` Captain & The Kid '' , we now know Elton had n't totally lost his edge . After first hearing this dud , I feared he had . If you have a hankering for some newer E.J . masterpieces , avoid this CD and go for one of the previously mentioned .	-1
From the OBJECTIVE reviewer ... '' Recover Your Soul '' is decent and adding the duet version of `` Live Like Horses '' would have been a slight improvement . The big single `` Something in the Way '' was only big because of the song it was paired with cuz it 's nothing special .	-1
John Mellencamp is one of my all time favorite singers . I love his all American rock and roll , the feel good vibe ( most of ) his songs possess and pretty much everything else . That being said , `` The Best That I Can Do : 1978-1998 '' is a single disc collection that does not do this great singer justice.Now do n't get me wrong , I love every song on this collection . Basically what this is is a sampling of all Mellencamp 's big hits , including `` Hurts So Good '' , `` Jack And Diane '' , `` Pink Houses '' , `` Authority Song '' , `` Small Town '' , `` R.O.C.K . In The U.S.A. '' and `` Cherry Bomb '' . These are all true American classics , but this group of songs does n't even come close to including all of his best work.For a lightyears better collection of Mellencamp 's best work , try picking up `` Words And Music '' , a two disc collection which includes all the songs here ( with the exception of the new recording `` Without Expression '' ) , plus many other great classics such as `` This Time '' ( a personal favorite ) , `` Peaceful World '' , `` Wild Night '' , `` Human Wheels '' , `` Pop Singer '' , `` Key West Intermezzo ( I Saw You First ) '' , and thankfully , `` Rain On The Scarecrow - Blood On The Plow '' .Overall , this cd really is n't worth it unless you just want hits ( remeber these are all five star songs ) . Most people should buy the aforementioned `` Words And Music '' or seek out the original albums .	-1
I truly do n't like John Mellencamp . His music was always some of the most offensive classic rock that came from the 80 's because he hardly ever had any interesting musical ideas . Generic country rock with unmemorable vocal melodies . A weak Creedence Clearwater Revival ripoff . That 's my impression of his work . It was always straight-forward , predictable commercial country rock/hard rock that never really did anything for me personally.This collection of tracks captures every single overplayed moment in all of its glory . A disc you truly do n't need to own because even today all you have to do is turn on your radio to ANY classic rock station and find most of the songs on the disc featured there , making this disc entirely pointless.The songs I particularly dislike would be `` Pink Houses '' and `` Lonely Ol ' Night '' . `` Jack and Diane '' HAS to be one of the most overplayed songs of all-time . It was great the first time you heard SOME of these songs , but not anymore . Overexposure can ruin a musicians career in the long run.I have warmed up to `` Small Town '' over the years though . `` Hurt so Good '' has to be one of the corniest attempts at a ballad ever .	-1
Every album The Moody Blues has released after & quot ; Long Distance Voyager & quot ; has been fairly worthless . For some reason , I used to like this lame stuff back when I was in high school . As I 've grown older and wiser , I have come to realize the error of my ways . & quot ; The Present & quot ; is a thoroughly mediocre album from a bunch of washed up hippie has-beens that barely has enough energy to power your speakers . Stick to classic Moody Blues material instead .	-1
Bon Jovi 's self titled debut album contains nine tracks which are all right but with the exception of Runaway do not reach the musical heights of their later albums . You would purchase this album more for historical value if your fan of the greatest rock band of the 80 's rather than for the actual songs on here . This album is where it all began and the tracks are not as substantial guitar wise or lyrically as the boys will achieve on their later masterpieces . Unless you are a huge Bon Jovi fan you probably will not want this album . Bon Jovi have created some of the greatest albums ever made and New Jersey and Slippery When Wet would be my recommendations if you do not own any of their albums at all and are looking to start .	-1
I loved this album when it first came out on vinyl and waited many years to by it on cd.When I found this version on Amazon I thought I would take a chance on it although it did not appear to remastered . Not one thing was done to improve the sound quality for this release.The sound on this cd is as flat as a pancake.The magnificent music on this album has been reduced to a sound that 's not even fit for the cut-out bin.There ought to be a law against music this wonderful being issued in any medium that sounds this bad.I 'll probably never listen to it again.Please note , this review applies to the 1990 version .	-1
Just so you know where I 'm coming from , I think that what the Moody Blues produced from 1967-1970 is one of the great legacies of the rock era . I am less familiar with their post-1981 output , but much of what I 've heard is likeable . I 'm glad you are interested in the Moodies and encourage you to explore their first five albums . With that said , I can not recommend Seventh Sojourn ( 1972 ) . Every song is either plodding and dull or sticky sweet . The worst offenders are John Lodge 's two offerings on Sojourn . `` Is n't Life Strange ? '' is like gooey treacle . Compare it to the unsentimental beauty of John 's `` Eyes of a Child '' on `` Children 's Children '' . `` I 'm Just a Singer in a Rock 'n Roll Band '' , with its forced energy and `` is it over yet ? '' conclusion gives rock 'n roll a bad name . Compare it to the natural-sounding energy of John 's `` Ride My See Saw '' , on `` Lost Chord '' or `` To Share Our Love '' on `` Threshold '' . Even ace songwriter Justin Hayward flops here , with little cream-puff ditties and inane lyrics : `` All we are trying to say is we are all we 've got '' . Compare them to the passion of his `` Gypsy '' on `` Children '' , The Actor on `` Lost Chord '' , or the perfect rock 'n roll gem `` It 's Up to You '' , on `` Question of Balance '' . Mike Pinder seems to be the only one of the bunch who 's really putting effort into his songs , but the results are ponderous and do not wear well . Do I blame the Moodies for running out of ideas or cashing in on this album 's enormous sales ? Of course not . Obviously they pleased many people and they deserved the recognition . But because there is not one song in this collection that I enjoy , one star is all they 're getting from this loyal fan .	-1
Well shame on the people involved in this `` SACD Deluxe Edition '' project . Oh , maybe that 's a little harsh.First off , as another Amazon reviewer noted , the sound has been aggressively compressed , which means , by the time you 've reached the later stages of the album , you may experience some ear fatigue . The sound is unrelenting and it changes the original dynamics . I felt like I was hearing a whole new mix , which is a sign of over compressing . The song , `` House Of Four Doors '' comes off really well , actually . It 's never sounded so powerful . I did n't even know their was a kick drum on that song ! But , then a song like `` The Actor , '' has a strange moment , Justin 's vocal is almost buried by the normally mellow background , which is led by the mellotrons flutes . Has the music industry gone compression mad ? Or , were the Moodies worried that their back catalogue ( the holy seven ) lacked musical muscle , and super charging it with heavy compression is the answer ? Or even both ? Another thing about aggressive compression , about a year ago I bought the EMI `` re-master '' of Deep Purple 's 1973 `` Who Do We Think We Are '' album , and by the time I got towards the end , my ears were tired . So , recently I bought the gold disc version which avoids over compression , and it not only sounded better , but my ears were n't tired by the end . But , since the Moodies do n't play as loud as Purple , it should n't be a real problem . Now that I got that off my chest ... Secondly , the `` SACD Deluxe Edition '' bonus track enticement , just ticks me off . Sure , there are some good rarities here . For example , `` Dr. Livingston '' is actually more convincing than the official version . So then , why not release a `` Rarities Collection '' instead ? Maybe they thought the material is n't strong enough to stand on it 's own ? I do n't know . But , it does make for good bonus track material.Thirdly , as another Amazon reviewer noted , the great cover artwork has been ruined by the people in charge of reproducing the cover ! The cover images have been reproduced way too light so that nearly all the detail has been faded ! But , the booklet is really good , with rare photos , stories and lots studio information.In conclusion , after hearing a number of these `` SACD Deluxe Editions , '' I 'll be keeping my old ( 1997 ) re-masters , after all , they still look and sound great . But now I have two versions of each album , great , just what I needed ? !	-1
This is a typical late 60s Moody Blues album . Take a couple of good songs , in this case & quot ; The Question & quot ; and & quot ; And the Tide Rushes In , & quot ; and surround them with a bunch of super pretentious filler material . You 're better off with a Moody Blues anthology album .	-1

The sound is unrelenting and it changes the original dynamics . I felt like I was hearing a whole new mix . Another sign of over compressing . It seemed to help at least a couple songs `` The Balance , '' where the bottom end was a lot more in control and `` Never Comes The Day , '' which sounded really clear and focused . But , overall , has the whole music industry gone `` compression '' crazy ? Or , are the Moody Blues worried that their back catalogue ( the holy seven ) was lacking musical muscle , and are super charging it with heavy compression ? Also , another reviewer talked about the bass being too quiet for the surround sound mix , but I felt the bass was n't as strong on the `` regular '' mix , as it is on the other `` SACD Deluxe Editions . '' It 's reasonable , but not as breathtakingly boosted as the others in this deluxe series.Another thing about aggressive compression , this also happened about a year ago when I bought the EMI `` re-master '' of Deep Purple 's 1973 album `` Who Do We Think We Are .

The Moody Blues were for my generation the Powerhouse Band that fused hard rock with classical to create dreamscapes . Their signature sound enthralled millions ! Yet they started to slip from their pedestals , beginning with this album.The Song `` Question '' was by far one of their most powerful , beautiful and brilliant pieces ever created . Yet the other songs and ballads on this album are , in my opinion , mediocre.The blues resurfaced and climbed their pedestal once again with `` Seventh Sojurn . '' From then on , they have never been as creative as they were on `` To Our Children 's Children 's Children . `` The best way to buy this album is to get on an online MP3 service and purchase only the song : `` Question . ''	-1
Buy only if you collect the M.B. 's . This release has three , maybe four songs worth capturing .	-1
After six long years without fresh Moody Blues music ( their solo work in the interim certainly did n't count ) , I jumped at `` Octave '' when the LP hit the stands back in the summer of '78 . I tried , I really tried , I so WANTED to enjoy it . I eagerly sought out the trademark blends , the right instrumentals , the right SOUND.Well , a fair try , this LP was , but it just did n't happen . Collectively , `` Octave '' clunked , excepting one track , `` One Step Into the Light '' by Mike Pinder.Pinder 's departure from the band after `` Octave '' was a sad closing of the door on my interest in anything the band did from there on . I listened from a distance , even saw them in concert in 2001 -- alas , Pinder 's balding pate so noticeably absent on stage and my evening 's enjoyment so incomplete . I 've come to appreciate his talents as true Moody Blues more than any of the others . Not to disparage Justin Hayward , John Lodge , Ray Thomas and Graeme Edge . Every one of them deserves favour as a true artist in a sea of wannabes . But Pinder best put forth the dream-like sound , the mood , the close-your-eyes-and-listen elements untethered to a 3-minute time limit . Such qualities had withered by the time `` Octave '' came out and were altogether dead on all of the band 's subsequent albums.Truly , we were spoiled with the above lineup 's seven masterpieces , not to mention Phil Travers ' fantastic cover works , from '67 to '72 . By the late '70s and especially into the shallow '80s , the threshold was met and the sojourn was over . The days and future of such quality work had passed . I feel fortunate to have experienced those works of art during that classic period . The real beauty , the balance if you will , is they 're still with us and , I hope , gaining a new audience , our children and their children , in search of the lost art of the classic Moody Blues .	-1
Most Moody Blues albums are spotty , usually containing a mixture of good and bad songs . But on & quot ; Octave , & quot ; they forgot to include any good ones . Released the same year ( 1978 ) as Yes 's worst album , & quot ; Tormato , & quot ; it may have had something to do with lumbering dinosuar art rock bands failing to compete in the brave new world of Punk rock .	-1
Someone wrote that everything will be released on CD sooner or later . This just in ... everything will be re-released and remastered sooner or later by greedy record companies trying to stay alive . Such is the case here . Take Octave for what it truly is , an uneven mish-mash of styles from a band trying to regain their focus after a long sabbatical . Yes , there are some nice moments but there are a lot of dreadful ones as well . Fast forward to the BONUS tracks . Five live cuts culled from various shows that sound like they were recorded over the phone from the 99th row . Save your money if you think there is anything revelatory on these tracks . The title for this album should have been `` Will The Real Moody Blues Please Stand Up '' . An embarassment !	-1
Even though it had been six years since their last album , the boys had been very busy . All members released at least one solo album , and Hayward and Lodge recorded together . So it 's not like they had a huge backlog of songs that had piled up , and it shows here . The song selection is weak , and the band seems to be going through the motions here . The first side of the album is pretty solid , but the second side is abyssmal . Skip this one and go right to the much better Long Distance Voyager .	-1
I was never a big Moody Blues fan but this does have one great song ... '' Steppin in a Slide Zone '' . I like it because it rocks much harder than their typical works . `` Driftwood '' and `` I 'll be Level with you '' are also good . After that , the quality severely wanes .	-1
After the Moody Blues ' superb album `` Seventh Sojourn , '' fans had to wait another six years before the band 's next album , having to be content with wading through various solo projects , and the decent , but uneven , `` Blue Jays '' album ( a collaboration between Justin Hayward and John Lodge ) . Unfortunately , it was clearly not worth the wait , as `` Octave '' proved to be , far and away , the band 's weakest album to that point ( later `` outdone '' by the dreadful `` Sur La Mer '' and `` Keys of the Kingdom '' ) .The album starts out promisingly enough , with the lively `` Steppin ' in a Slide Zone '' written by John Lodge . A closer listening though , reveals how thin this song is , and how it relies on gimmickry more that musicianship . Still , it is one of the albums best songs , and far better that Lodge 's other contribution , the cloying `` Survival . `` The two songs by Ray Thomas are over-orchestrated , boring , and immediately forgettable , all the more surprising in that every preceding album has at least one ( and sometimes two ) strong Thomas contribution . Edge 's `` I 'll Be Level With You '' is noisy but without much substance , and Pinder 's `` One Step Into the Night '' is simply awful , with the worst Moody Blues ' lyrics ever written ( i.e . `` the one thing I can do , is play my mellotron for you '' ) .As far as Justin 's four songs , I suppose `` Driftwood '' is the best one , but that is n't saying much . I find `` Top Rank Suite '' annoying , and `` The Day We Meet Again '' just too long.Luckily , the next album `` Long Distance Voyager '' would be a significant improvement , and , I suppose , that since `` Octave '' was the first album the band released after I `` discovered '' them and became a huge fan ( I think in 1975 ) , it will always have a certain amount of sentimental value for me .	-1
Yet another classic that only became popular because their audience was stoned . Blaring , muddy , unmusical crud .	-1
This `` Tom Waits '' guy sucks . What a horrible voice ! He sounds like a piece of raw meat ran over by a truck . Listen to REAL music like Nickelback or St. Anger by Metallica if you want a truly enjoyable listening experience .	-1
But I think this album is extremely overrated . It just does n't do much for me . Not too exiting . I dig BONE MACHINE and MULE VARIATIONS and I consider HEARTATTACK AND VINE to be quinessential Waits . But I 'll only listen to `` Downtown Train '' and maybe one or two others before I 've had it with this tedious album . Sorry if you 'd prefer me to jump on the critical bandwagon , but it 's my honest opinion .	-1
Grace Jones was renowned for her weird , totally off the wall recordings and performances , but she was also curiously fascinating in doing so with albums like Warm Leatherette ( 1980 ) and Nightclubbing ( 1981 ) showing a flair for verstality and imagination . However when she returned to the studios in 1985 , she seemed to have lost direction . Although the atmospheric Slave To The Rythm is an excellent track that became one of her biggest sellers , the remainder of the album is an eccentric , blatantly weird affair . The diverse musical arrangements may come across as highly imaginative to some but to me it really lacks any sort of depth . Grace sounds at her most vampish on the almost gophic opening track , Jones The rythm , which is too uncomfortably strange from an equally strange artist . Recommended to die-hard Grace Jones fans only .	-1

Derek and the Dominoes were , of course , a one-album band for Eric Clapton and `` guest '' musicians . The title song and `` Bell Bottom Blues '' notwithstanding , the album is , in a word , B-O-R-I-N-G . While the virtuoso guitar soloing between Clapton and Allman may enthrall some , this album is guaranteed to otherwise put to sleep the vast majority of the listening public . This is definitely NOT an album to play while driving down the highway late at night . ZZZZZZZZZ ... ..	-1
This CD title was falsely created on the Amazon system by an unknown , crooked Marketplace Seller . They removed the main Layla album CD from theLayla 20th Anniversary Box Setand created a separate listing for it , with a much higher price than the 3CD box set itself , in an attempt to fool an unsuspecting buyer into wasting a lot of money.DO N'T BE RIPPED OFF , just buy the box !	-1
You want a `` deluxe '' edition ? Go for superior quality and buy the SACD edition . It 's incredible . CDs are low-fi crap no matter what you add to the song list .	-1
Other than Layla , there is n't much of interest here , just more British white boy blues , I 'd stick to the comps .	-1
Another disappointment . The only good thing on the CD is & quot ; Too Many Walls & quot ; ... besides that , the CD is pretty much not good for much .	-1
Whoa ... .. Hold on , am I the only kid that has this cd ? I only have it cuz it was free , and I collect cds so I though , why not ! This is not that great to me , I prefer female artists like Mandy Moore and Christina Aguleria as opposed to this person . I recomedd it to the older audience , like 25 and older , actually its sorta like Sheryl Crow ? ! ?	-1
A typical example of the quirky electronic music the 80 's seems to have been dominated by ; the difference this time is the talent of lyricist and lead singer Stan Ridgway , whose bizarre little stories almost rise above the drum machines and repetitive electronica . I say almost because Ridgway is much more successful at getting his tales across on his solo works then this more than occasionally discordant CD . There are some good tunes here , particularly the insanely catchy `` Mexican Radio '' ( `` I wish I was in Tijuana , eating barbecued iguana '' That is a great line ! ) and the title track , a fever dream trip to a very wild west . I find Ridgway 's solo material more mature and interesting ; unless you really wanted to hear `` Mexican Radio '' and his early work I would skip this one .	-1
How is it that so many people think this album is great ? I 'm a fan of the Go go 's and I finally got this album . I 've heard some tracks here and there throughout the years . After listening to the complete album , I must say , the only reason I think they actually got their status was due to them being young female rockers with elements of pop . In my opinion , they did n't master their sound until after the broke up . This is evident on 'Return to the Valley of the Go go 's ' . You can hear in the arrangements of the music and vocals that the texture in the playing , along with Belinda 's vocal performance was more refined and listenable.As for Beauty and the Beat , I 'm completely disappointed . Belinda 's singing is awful on some of these tracks , very pitchy and off-key . A lot of the band 's work is also slightly out of tune . Their was n't the best harmony in their debut . Belinda even said it , along with the others , that they were pretty much self-tought , and some of their playing/singing was off . She also stressed that because it was the 'punk days ' they could get away with not knowing how to play , because 'it was punk ' . Well , let me just add to that , she tells no lies . It 's necessarily the songs or lyrics . I think the songs could 've been better if Belinda was more vocally trained , and the band was more in shape . Their most developed sound were the three new songs from 1994 's Valley of the Go go 's , and 'Bless the Go go 's from 2001 . I think if they were in this shape while recording this album , it 'd be so.much better . As for this album , I could do without it . Everytime Belinda trys to hit those high note 's I cringe and squint my eyes . I ca n't be the only one who knows that 'We got thee beat ' is played too high for Belinda 's vocal , you can hear that she sounds forced as if she 's struggling . I 'm pretty sure she was out of breath and winded after that recording session ... I also noticed how some of the songs have a very pop-country sound to them . Belinda sings with a twang as well throughout this album . Fading fast isa great example of this	-1
So Long & Thanks for All the Shoes~ NOFX is a not an awfull album but it is just not very interesting and sounds like any other punk album . Simply chords , lyrics that are laced with curse words and seem to be talking about absolutely nothing in particular and sounds like kids playing around with politics but they have no real idea what they are talking about so the end result is that it just sounds trite and forced . Someone should have taught these guys to write decent lyrics instead of these trite and boring schlock that they produce . Knowing how to sing also helps and being able to play your instrument also helps . This album is so boring..but it is not awfull enough to get one star .	-1

Insane Clown P*ssies ... or Posse , I mean , love to always attack people from the south in their trashy `` music '' . Calling us rednecks , bigots , hillbillies ... and other insults . But yet , they ( ICP , Juggalos and Juggletes ) `` claim '' that they are all about love ? ? ? Give me a f-ing break ! ICP and their little cult of followers , are nothing but a bunch of hypocrites . People from the south are so much more kinder , giving , humble and good hearted , then the people up north ever were . Up north , all there is , is a bunch of cold hearted , self centered , stuck up jerks . Down south they treat you like FAMILY . Big difference . ICP likes to talk alot of crap about the south , but I can PROMISE you , that they would n't run their mouths around a bunch of crazies down south , armed with shotguns . ICP are cowards . Just like all the rest of the cRappers out there !	-1
Weakest of all his works including no limit , maybe 2 or 3 good songs . this was when Snoop sold out Pac ' . Never respected him since then . Sell out .	-1
I cant find one good song on the whole thing , just ignore this record because it 's wack.get me against the world though .	-1
Another over-rated album by 2pac . This album released after his death is Pac 's most modest effort . The stand-out tracks , & quot ; Bomb 1 & quot ; , & quot ; Hail Mary & quot ; , & quot ; Toss It Up & quot ; are his best , but not powerful enough to save the rest of this CD . Supposedly the wrath of his alter-ego Makaveli , this CD covers no new territory , sticking to the same & quot ; been there , done that & quot ; themes on & quot ; All Eyez on Me & quot ; . Only HIS hardcore fans will call this a masterpiece . In my opinon , 2pac had already peaked.Peace El-715	-1
This is dr dre 's worst album ever.It seems it was rushed and made in a day.All the songs are boring and the production sucks.I will try and forget that dre ever made this cd.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE ! ! !	-1
This was not one of 1996 's biggest hitters even with Dr Dre 's name on it . This is an album 's worth of artists on and associated with Dre 's then newly formed Aftermath Records . Although not a terrible effort , it was more of a public setting of a new landmark in Dre 's music career to show people ( perhaps the infamous Death Row Records too ) that it was the case that they needed him more then he needed them as implied on Dre 's own track 'Been There Done That ' . Still , there are some highlights on ' ... The Aftermath ' but very few artists really get to shine . RBX 's 'Blunt Time ' and King T 's 'Str-8 Gone ' are the album 's only worth while listeners apart from Dre 's solo track.Either his heart or his head were not really in this album as the majority of production held by the Doctor is not up to scratch compared with his debut 'The Chronic ' or various other produced tracks on ex-labelmates albums , Snoop Doggy Dogg - ( Gin & Juice ) and Tupac Shakur - ( California Love ) . ' ... The Aftermath ' is more of a declaration of independance rather then a wannabe platinum album as I believe Dre could easily have invested just a little more time into this album by adding a hit track or two , however the album fails to kickstart anywhere from the beginning through to the end . For hardcore fans only .	-1
I bought this a long time ago thinking it was gon na be full of the usual heat Dr. Dre brings . I remember skimming through it thinking it was the worst purchase I ever made for an album . There is nothing but talentless no-name rappers and singers throughout and just forgettable tracks , one after another . There are only 3 songs out of 16 that are worth keeping and actually have replay value , I still enjoy them to this day . Of course it 's because they sound like some effort was put into them by great rappers like KRS-One , Nas , King Tee and an actual song with Dr. Dre on it.KEEPERS : East Coast/West Coast KillasBeen There , Done ThatStr8 GoneThrow the rest in the garbage and press delete .	-1
Dre means well with introducing new artists to the populace , but these ones try to hit it hard and not to present the wow to us ... Dre does well with his songs .	-1
I 'm glad I did n't bougth this new , I bougth it used , and gave it away a couple of days later . Simply because the album hardly got any good songs , the only ones worth mention is the intro , eastcoast/westcoast killaz , been there done that and the mel-man track called shi -- -n on the world . And for does songs I would n't pay this much . Skip it , unless you 're a TRUE Dr. Dre fan that buys everything he touches . I recommend either & quot ; The Chronic & quot ; or & quot ; 2001 & quot ; if you want Dre at his best .	-1
The year was 1996 . Dr. Dre had managed to disentangle himself from the talons of Suge Knight and Death Row Records . Dre had started his own label , Aftermath , and was ready to sit back , renounce his gangsta image and watch the money roll in . While Death Row was reeling from the death of 2Pac and the disappointing sales of Snoop 's Doggfather album , Dre was poised to start a new rap empire.So out he came with this Aftermath sampler compilation , and we did n't hear from him again for three years . The reason ? The album more or less ... and Dre 's midas production touch was missing on most of the four or five songs he actually had a hand in.It 's a shame , too , because the one Dre track on the album , `` Been There , Done That , '' is really good . The production is smooth and silky , with distinctive percussion and a lazy bass line , and Dre sounds more confident and comfortable than ever as he brags about his earthly possessions . ( `` I 've got a palace in the hills overlooking the sea / It 's worth eight , but I only paid 5.3 . '' ) An entire post-gangsta Dre album in this vein would have sold through the roof , but alas , he had n't the creative energy for it.The other album highlights can be summed up in a couple paragraphs . KRS-One , Nas and B-Real of Cypress Hill perform under the name Group Therapy with `` East Coast / West Coast Killas , '' a Dre-produced track that picks up where `` Natural Born Killas '' left off . The vocal trade-offs are seamless , the bass is solid and the whistling Dre synth is bad @ ss as ever.Mel-Man , who co-produced Dr. Dre 2001 , gets his solo track in `` Sh**tin ' on the World , '' which overcomes its rather non-descript Dre beat with humor , intentional and otherwise . ( Mel 's liner notes read , `` I grew up with roaches y'am saying straight reppin ' the projects to the fullest ! `` ) The aborted R+B girl group Hands-On turns in the piano-heavy , sultry groove `` Got Me Open '' with a Dre rap reminiscent of the same era 's `` No Diggity . '' And RC ( the only artist on the album with two songs ) turns in a decent , funky remake of David Bowie 's `` Fame . `` Otherwise , the album is indistinct , passed down to Dre production apprentices like Bud'da , Floyd Howard , Flossy P and Maurice Wilcher . There 's a reason acts like Miscellaneous , King T , Nowl and Sharief never took off . As an intro record-label sampler , you have to wonder if Dre planned to produce or oversee albums from all these acts or if he was just looking to put together a half- @ ssed compilation and laugh all the way to the bank while Death Row went under . Either way , it was a mistake .	-1
I bought this album simply because I owned The Chronic and 2001 and I loved them both ... But this.. Well , this ca n't be considered a Dr. Dre CD.First of all , just one of the sixteen songs in this CD is Dre 's . So Dre is presenting something ( his label ) , but it does n't mean he 's presenting himself , if you know what I mean.This album has a lot of gangsta raps like Been There Done That ( by Dr , Dre ) , but also & quot ; soul & quot ; raps ( calm raps ) like Choices ( by Kim Summerson ) .But what you must really be asking yourself is : is this CD worth my money ? The answer is no , unless you 're a total hardcore Dre fan and you want to own every CD with his name on it . Well , because , in my opinion , he 's just a mere guest in this CD.So if you 're looking for a good Dr. Dre CD , look elsewhere for The Chronic or 2001 . If you 're looking for quality rap , look elsewhere too .	-1
The Lady of Rage was a vital component of the Chronic and Doggystyle albums . Dre knows how to bring different rappers together to produce a perfect blend of voices . The production on this album is good by the likes of DJ Premier and Daz Dillinger , but The Lady of Rage just does n't have the talent to pull off a solo album with so few guest appearances . Only a few rappers are capable of that . The Notorious BIG ... I ca n't think of another . Even Snoop Doggy Dogg has always relied heavily on having a large crew of rappers to back him up , and he was the front man of those two albums , not just a supporting rapper like rage was . I 'm surprised Rage has made a second album . I wo n't be buying it . I bought this because I was in need of another Chronic/Doggystyle fix but this is n't it . I believe that music can be judged by how often you want to listen to it . I never feel like listening to this .	-1
You ever have those friends that all start going on and on about this great band they have started listening to , and how cool the bass player is 'cause he plays bass so loudly due to his mommy and daddy not buying him an amp ? ... and then praise him like it makes him something special ? Trust me , it does not make him one of the greatest bass players of all time , he may be better then the alternative rejects who thought 6 string guitar was so hard they switched to bass 'cause it 's easier , those kind of talentless so called musicians that followed the trend of , learn 3 chords , and violate them.On this particular album here , the track those friends at the time flocked around was Load Up The Cannonballs and Shake Hands With Beef.I think my initial reaction was to just stop in my tracks and blink a few times wondering how the heck you come up with a title like that ? By the time it was over , and those friends at the time had over played it , I personally rate that song up there with whoever wrote `` Push The Little Daisies To Make Them Come Up '' as part of the top 10 worst songs of all time . Then the top 5 of the worlds most annoying songs . And top 3 of the worlds most overrated as something special as judged by people who are not musicians and can see it for what it really is list.The rest of the album was a snore fest too , no memorable tracks what so ever , except for the one i mentioned cause it 's the worst thing this band has ever put together .	-1
Well , I have to admit I had to buy it after hearing & quot ; Walking In the Sun & quot ; and & quot ; The Fonz & quot ; , which still are accessible after a while even though I hate the rest of the album , really . Anyway , I did have som high expectations about this one . so , there are those two tracks , which are nice , then there are four songs , which sound good for the 3-5 first times , but which slowly start to irritate ( Let 's rock , Why Ca n't ... , padrino , Flo ) . Then there are a couple of songs which are prettty neutral , but lame . And then there are the ones that have irritated me since the first listen ; for example , & quot ; Disconnect The Dots & quot ; is disgusting teen punk . Yuch ! . Well , anyway , to sum it all up , I 'd have to say , that ska may attract you at first , but in the long run it 's simply one of the most efficient vomiting tools . This album is just another commercially ambitious record with few catchy tunes , but not a bit of durability . And it sure ai n't real ska , is it ?	-1
This cd is by far the worst CD I have ever heard . Not one song beside the hit single & quot ; Walkin On The Sun & quot ; ie bearable . I hope and pray Smash Mouth disapear from music before they can flood the market with any more trash . In a few years I expect to find this cd overflowing in used bins in cd stores everywhere . I urge everyone to go buy a sandwhich instead and leave this cd right where it is .	-1
Absolute [ junk ] . This could have been a good album if more songs like Walkin ' on the Sun were on it . Some of the intros are great until the actual songs start like Padrino for example and then they unleash a barrel of noisy , monotonous [ junk ] that 's supposed to be music but bears little resemblance . Do n't waste your money on this one !	-1
I thought this was supposed to be software that had cheese recipes in it . Instead I get a lot of Bass and some guy talking through his nose . I finally was able to make some but it did not taste that good so I am going to return this because it no workie workie .	-1
Primus sucks ! I 'm serious . They do . Do they even have a bassist ? Oh , yeah , they do . Les Claypool or some redneck name like that . It 's so hard to hear him ! All you can hear is extremely simple basslines . Do yourself a favour and check out `` St. Anger '' if you want some killer bass .	-1
This was a huge let down out of the 13 songs 2 are good . And the songs that are good really arint that good in the first place ! 'Here Comes The Bastards ' and 'Jerry Was A Race Car Driver ' are the only good songs . This is a really really really bad record , Les Claypool should be banned from ever singing . The guitar work isnt bad , and thr Drumming is all right . The only really good thing about this bad is Les Claypools bass playing I mean I can name maybe two or three better bass players and that is it ! But no matter how good he plays the bass it would never make up for how bad this record is ! ! ! Dont Waste your money , I mean you would have really really high to get into this , and you still wouldnt think it was good you would think it was funny .	-1
Nothing GoodOwning this cd is bad for youDumb songwritingOfficially the worst cd everUnofficially bad tooBoring , Juvenile lyricsTragic Kingdom is 1000 times betterMy sister loves this garbage , a self proclaimed number one fan , but what does she know .	-1
`` What 's Up '' , the catchy song with the acousitc guitar out of tune ( which , I always thought , would have been the perfect song for Heart ) , is the only thing good here . The rest of this album is a mess . Linda Perry has , of course , gone on to better things .	-1
