This is a great little gadget to have around . We 've already used it to look for splinters and a few other uses . The light is great . It 's a handy size . However , I do wish I 'd bought one with a little higher magnification .	1
I would recommend this for a travel magnifier for the occasional reading.I had read on another review about a magnifier having a problem with the light coming on . I did find that this one appeared to be DOA out of the box . But , after opening & shutting the viewer to turn on & off the light , the light began to come on . After several times of doing this , the light appears to be coming on all the time.It is small , but for taking it someplace & reading things like a menu in a dark corner of a restaurant , this is great .	1
What I liked was the quality of the lens and the built in light . Then lens had no discernable distortion anywhere . It magnified everything evenly without the ripples and distortion that I 've seen with other low cost magnifiers . This light is a nice touch and easy to use . If you want it on just pull the lens out a bit . It is focused very close to the center of what you will be look at and provides nice , even coverage.What I did n't like was the brightness ( actually dimmness ) of the light and where it is focused . LEDs can be lots brighter , I know as I 've seen them . Also , the light focuses at the center of you field of view but only when the lens is too close to be focused properly.Bottom line is this is a good value for a magnifier and could have been made great with better quality control.BTW , I feel that honest , effective reviews can take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping . I 've always appreciated the help I 've received from other reviewers and work hard to return the favor as best as I can . I hope you found this review helpful and if there was anything you thought was lacking or unclear leave a comment and I 'll do what I can to fix it .	1
This is very nice . You pull out on the magnifier when you want the light to come on , then slide it back in . I would recommend buying this if you need something with a light that you can easily put in your pocket or purse .	1
The light comes on when the item is pulled . This is much easier to use than the plastic bookmark magnifier and the bar magnifier I previously purchased . I was glad to have it lit when I needed to see the serial number on the back of an ipod .	1
These are lightweight and efficient and have some very good points : - the batteries last 2-3 months with daily use.- the LED is bright enough and adequately covers the whole magnified area under the 3X lens -- the lens itself is glass and good quality- the shell is plastic and it & # 8217 ; s very light ( but may not take a beating over time ) - it & # 8217 ; s easy to open and turn on the light and the sliding mechanism has never failedI bought a six-pack of these from another vendor and all I can say is to shop around because prices vary tremendously . I use this magnifier to inspect seeds and leaves . I keep these magnifiers on my desk , in my briefcase , and in a backpack and I like them a lot .	1
Seems to be a legit 3X . I bought my first and everything perfect . So I bought a 2nd for my nephew - but that one had the light issue someone else mentioned ( really dim , flickering ) . Before I sent it back , I wanted to check the batteries - so I unscrewed where they are , took them out , but it looked like the contact on the right battery on the unit ( uses 2 small watch-like ones ) had some kind of grime on it - wiped that off , and I also bent the little tab to stick out a little more to give it a better contact on the battery - did that for the other side as well ( it 's different because of the +/- but you can bend both sides out a little ) . After that , put the batteries back in and it works like my good one .	1
I 'll admit it . I fought like crazy when people started suggesting that I get a magnifying glass . Yes , I could no longer some menu descriptions , especially in low light . And when I needed to see the model number on an electronic device 's sticker , and could n't , well , that was a problem too . After I accepted that I had a problem , I refused to get an old-fashioned magnifier , like my mother uses . So , I looked around and this caught my eye ( haha ) . I 've been using it for a few weeks now and I love it . It is black and sleek , and , yes gets the job done . And , those low light environments ? No longer a problem , since this has a built in light that turns on when you slide open the magnifier .	1
This magnifier is just what I was looking for . It is small and easy to hold . I wanted something to read small numbers/characters on electronic stuff like computers , electronics , etc . I also work on the insides of computers and this is great for seeing small things . I do n't want to magnify books or magazines . The light works well and makes reading small things very easy .	1
Most of the purses I own have black lining . Good luck finding anything black in black purse ! I chose this color because I can actually find it ! ! ! It works wonderfully in a dimly lit restaurant , when the print is really small , when I need a light & a magnifier to find the splinter . WONDERFUL .	1
I only gave this 4 stars instead of 5 , because of the packaging it comes in . The plastic is sharp & is n't that easy to carry in your bag without stabbing yourself on it , but without the plastic box , the magnifier would get very scratched . I may discard the plastic box , but keep the magnifier in something soft , like a small sock . Otherwise , the magnifier works great .	1
UPDATE : This model has been bought out by Walgreens . The newer Walgreens version uses three AAA batteries instead of the CR1130 batteries this obsolete model uses . Go to the Walgreens website to find it . You can not buy it on their website , but Walgreens online has a zip code locator for a stocking store near you . Search Walgreens site search for `` magnifier '' . Also look at Walgreens branded `` Walgreens Led Magnifold 2X Rectangular Folding Magnifier '' . It 's a lot bigger hand held grip . It 's listed under $ 14.These are no longer available through Amazon . They were $ 10 each . Those are sold out and have not been replenished . I have seen these exact same lighted magnifiers listed under the Walgreens brand for $ 15 . I assume Walgreens bought the rights . They 've done that with a lot of very popular products.My elderly Mother loves this lighted magnifier . I love it too . So many things out there I can not read because the print is small and the background color washes out the letters ( dark ) . From over the counter pill bottles to every day packaging , this thing is a life saver .	1
purchased this for someone who has macular degeneration and she actually cried when she used it because she had not been able to read a newspaper for a couple years . Although I also bought her a small hand-held magnifier , this covers a large area so you do n't have to continually move the magnifier back and forth across the page.This allows it to be of use for reading large pages such as a newspaper or a full menu , for example.The fact that it is rigid allows it to be held more easily without it bending as some do which causes blurring and distortion of the page .	1
I bought this for my hubby who has the beginning of Macular Degeneration . I see him using it so I believe that it helps him .	1
I purchased for a friend who has ARMD ... .. she loves it , it is a great buy . I was quite impressed with this one , think I will get one for myself .	1
After cataract surgery I was unable to read . This magnifier was a big help in seeing small print and even the computer screen . My only complaint is it has to be held which got tiring really quickly . It also tends to distort slightly but not enough to be a big problem .	1
Easy to use when I have an 8X11 hard copy document that I want to read without moving a magnifying glass around . Very light weight and easy to hold above page for the desired magnification .	1
Several reviews of similar items reported & # 34 ; too flimsy & # 34 ; - you should n't see that complaint with this . Large enough for a full page of many magazines and virtually any book .	1
I bought this item for my husband to read small print as his eyesight was not good . I borrowed it so many times , that I decided to get one for myself . Both are used greatly on fine print on our prescription bottles any many other things where they insist on using small print on ingredients , etc . I design and sew fashions and use it in my design studio every time I have to rip and resew a seam . I always check with Amazon when looking for an item . The PRIME shipping saves a lot of money .	1
For the price this little magnifier works well for routine things like reading labels in the grocery , restaurant menus and the like . But , I would n't want to read a book with it.The sliding cover keeps fingers off the lens and the light is bright . Uses three AAA batteries , not included .	1
I like this thing . Works well , except the light switch is iffy . You have to jiggle the lense to get the light on sometimes . Otherwise it works very well .	1
great quality , feels very good in my hand , very good weight , non slippery handle . it 's a very good buy , cant wrong with this one . 34c is also very good , but shorter handle .	1
Make no mistake this is a sturdy long handled razor . Feels substantial in your hand and the finish makes it easy to hold onto when wet . Easy to keep clean with the two piece design . Plating was beautiful and very good quality razor .	1
This is my first safety Razor . it 's worked very well so far . It has a great weight to it and feels good in your hand . It took me a long time to convince myself to spend $ 50+ on a razor , but it has been a good one so far . The long handle is better for my because I have bear paws ...	1
I had a lot of trouble deciding which batteries to order , but I 'm happy with these . I 've only used a few , but they 've lasted for months of regular use now ( laser pointer ) and there have been no issues with leaking or anything else . Although these were n't the cheapest , I 'm glad I ordered these as I 've had no problems and they seem to work well .	1
Cheap batteries that did the job . They replaced older LR 44 's just fine . Time will tell if how long they last but the first 4 worked without issues . So much cheaper than at the local stores .	1
I need these batteries for light timers . I have three timers and each takes two batteries . The price of these batteries at the local drug store is far more . ( FAR MORE ! ) Buying these saved me a bundle . They were also delivered pretty fast . I am impressed .	1
No issues , these batteries work great . I find that a lot of kids electrinics use these batteries . The 10 pack was cheaper than buying one 1 from the store .	1
This is exactly what I needed for my clock . Between price and the product , it is excellent and does the job .	1
Would you rather pay 3 to 4 times the price for these same batteries at Walmart or Target ? They last for years and keep their charge .	1
These are perfect batteries for small electronic games such as the older ones that were around before all the fancy Game Boys and things came out . Most of them take two of these batteries so this pack has five sets of batteries if you use them for that purpose .	1
It works great . Do not hesitate to buy it and is much cheaper than store brands .	1
This is a great price for batteries , you could pay a couple of bucks a retail store for only 1 or 2 when you can get 10 on Amazon ! These little LR44 's are found in so many of my children 's toys , the Thomas the Tank Engine cars that talk , Tinkerbell that glows , Christmas ornaments , even some little cheap twirling lights bought at the dollar store . I have ordered these twice now , because something new dies and I find that it needs the same kind of battery . It 's definitely more economical to buy in this quantity than buying a couple at a time ! They also work well and last , too . Stock up HERE ! !	1
This is a handy , inexpensive source to replace LR44 batteries which are used in my calculators and other items around the house .	1
it is great to have a supply of this size battery . they are pricey in the stores and not always in stock	1
I never heard of this size until my granddaughter 's toy needed 3 of them . What a bargain these were and they worked fine . We have the leftovers saved for the next time !	1
Bought from Photoland NY , all batteries were fresh -- measured with DMM , all checked out at either 1.59V or 1.6V , no duds . Paid a little more from this seller but I got what I paid for and definitely way cheaper than purchasing locally .	1
Nothing to say about it . They are just batteries , but they are as they look like . I 'm satisfied with them .	1
These Alkaline batteries are certainly inexpensive . They 're OK for light duty devices that take multiple cells to keep the refresh cost low . More expensive Silver Oxide batteries will probably last longer , but at a higher cost . Note the seller shipped the batteries in the older packaging , not the new packaging pictured in the ad that I expected . Hopefully they are not very old stock .	1
so cheap and durable , shipped really fast to me and i have enough to do all my watches and a friends too	1
Bought 3 packs , prepared to live with a high percentage of bad ones considering that locally the same batteries are $ 3 each , but they are easy to check in the card and all were good . Bought these in 2011 just used the last ones and came back to order more when I realized I had n't reviewed them . Very pleased.BTW , it is true that the description is misleading , the batteries I received are alkaline , not silver-oxide . I will use only silver oxide in timekeeping devices , but for toys and flashlights , alkaline is a better value .	1
they worked for my daughters toy microphone thing and then after we got it working , I thought perhaps I should n't have bought the batteries to get it to work b/c it plays the same song over and over again ! ! haha	1
I got these for my Girlfriend Christmas Ornaments and now we are all happy now that they can play like last year .	1
This was a great purchase at a nice price . If I knew how good they were I probably would have bought more at the time .	1
No problem . Well pleased .	1
I purchased thsee even though it was not clear what the battery rating was . I was pleased to find an extremely high rating of 2500mah , not 1200 as another person got . These batteries work long and hard in my canon digital camera between charges . Charges are fast and easy . Awesome batteries . I will never bother buying regular Energizers again . I have Panasonic 2100 's and these Energizer 2500 's and both sets prove stronger and last much longer ( even between charges ) than regular non-rechargable energizers .	1
They work well , I 've had them now for quite a while but just getting to the review . They still hold a charge fairly well , if I leave them in there for a day or two they will run my xbox controller for about a day or sometimes half the day . But if you want to use them in something like a clock or TV remote , they will easily last more than a month .	1
Right out of the box and ready to go ! Everything here is a 5 star from the packaging to the product.Charged fully -- even though I did not use them immediately.Fits great ..packaged great -- opens easy all good on these .	1
If used most brands out there and in my experience this brand works the best for my applications .	1
I used rechargable batteries in flashlights , mouses , keyboards , clocks and my battery operated toothbrush . They recharge many times which more than justify the cost . I will continue to use this product in the future , also .	1
I bought these for my digital camera . I was apprehensive at first because the last Energizer rechargeable batteries I bought did n't hold a charge well . So far , these are working great . Hundreds of photos taken after the first charge and they 're still going strong . So far , so good .	1
In this day and age it is hard to understand why everyone is n't using rechargable batteries . I own about 6 packs of these batteries . They are wonderful . I bet I have saved hundreds of dollars so far and keep saving . Why pay $ 4.00 to $ 5.00 for one pack of batteries that get used once and thrown away when you can purchase these and reuse them 1000 times . I absolutely refuse to by disposable batteries for the most part . It is true that they do n't quite have the power of normal energizer alkaline batteries so they might be an issue for certain things that use a lot of power . For example Digital Camera 's take a lot of power . But for the most part these work really well and I have used them for 3 - 4 years now . I highly recommend them to everyone .	1
I use my rechargable batteries for just about everything . Be it remote controls , cameras , and flashlights and I have n't noticed any rapid deteriorating of the batteries . Recharging takes about 12 hrs but I keep extra just in case . The only issue I have had is the price - it keeps going up . I 've seen them priced as high as $ 12 for the 4 pack . I have also seen them as low as $ 7.99 at Menards they average about $ 9.99 . If you decide to use rechargable batteries just make sure you have extra ones for when they run down .	1
Energizer is one of the best brands for rechargeable batteries that I have purchased . They hold a charge a lot longer than many others .	1
I have mixed feelings about these batteries . They take a good charge and hold it better than my Duracell rechargebles , but still lose about 10 % overnight . I use them to power a one-LED night light outdoors . It keeps it bright for at least three nights if I remember to turn it off during the day . One of the four batteries is a little loosey-goosey . Sometimes it only charges about 75 % , though another recharge cycle will restore it to full again . Considering other reviewers ' comments about funky batteries , maybe they should tighten their quality control .	1
These are batteries . If you have ever seen batteries before then you know what Im talking about . Dont be surprised when you open this package and you see batteries . Thats exactly what they are.Works perfect in my two different battery chargers , and Energizer always keeps a long life !	1
Love them . . . They last a very long while and I use them to power my professional flashes . . . some say they dont the same amount of power as regular non-rechargable batteries and I agree . . . they have waaaay more ! I have used reg batteries in a pinch and can not even go an hour and my light output is very inconsistant . . . but depending on my location I can shoot with these an entire reception with one set : ) LOVE THEM ! !	1
At 2500ah , these rechargeable NiMh batteries provide more power fully charged that regular alkalines . My bicycle headlight shines brighter when I use these . In my digital camera it makes it able to shoot 3 frames per second . Get the Sony charger to go with these . They will last a long time . I am sold on NiMh rechargeable batteries !	1
If the original Energizer AA alkaline battery is The Bunny , a digital camera is a hungry wolverine , devouring 2 or 4 of them li'l guys at a time and spitting out an empty shell after just 20 to 50 pictures . Makes you wonder why every digital camera does n't have a big sticker on the box screaming `` FOR THE LOVE OF GOD , USE NiMH RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES ! ! `` The latest generation of Energizer Rechargeable batteries will outrun Energizer alkaline and lithium by miles , and come back for more after a trip to the recharger . They 'll keep your digital camera fat and happy on a single charge provided you let them `` cook '' for at least 24 hours on the first charge . After that , use 'em as little or as much as you want and store them in the charger between uses.As a `` thrash '' test , I charged a pair for 24 hours , removed them from the charger for another 24 hours and installed them in a Vivitar ViviCam 3746 3.1 megapixel digital camera . After taking over 100 pictures with both the flash and the LCD display switched on , the battery meter never dipped to the `` time to recharge '' mark . Remember , NiMH batteries are n't like those old NiCd batteries from way back in the 1990s . You never have to `` drain '' them regularly nor do you have to take them out of the charger to prevent overcharging.The recloseable package provides a handy pocket pack for carrying a spare pair ( if your digital camera uses 2 batteries ) , so the smartest way to use them is to buy 2 4-packs . Leave one set in the charger and take the other set when you head out for a day trip . On vacations , take along the charger and both sets of batteries . They do n't take up that much room and you 'll never have to buy an overpriced stale battery from a hotel gift shop .	1
I have two digital cameras and they both use AA batteries . Energizer batteries are one of the best . Hold their charge and when they do need to be charged they are ready to go again . Recommend .	1
Compared to older mode rechargeable batteries these held a charge ( unused in a drawer ) beautifully compared to my dead unused rechargeable batteries that were n't being used either .	1
I love these rechargeable batteries . They save a lot of money over the throw away batteries . They keep their charge for a long time , eve if you do n't charge them and use them immediately .	1
I originally got this for my daughter 's leapfrog leap pad . She was going through batteries every couple of days , so rather than go broke buying batteries , I got these along with theEnergizer Value Charger with AA Rechargeable Batteries , 4 Batteries Included , which gives us a set to put in her leap pad , and a set to keep on the charger charged . It charges well , and is always ready when I need to swap them out . It is definite woth the money , especially if you go through a lot of batteries .	1
I was going through quite a few batteries for my cats ' toys : there 's a chase-the-string toy , a chase-the-mouse-tail toy , and a whoo-hoo ! -chase-the-laser dot toy . Using the rechargeable batteries works well - I have an Energizer charger and two sets of 4 AAs to rotate , so they 've always got something ready to pounce on ! I 'm saving money and not throwing away so many batteries , and the cats do n't notice the difference !	1
I took 83 digital pics , plus 14 minutes of QuickTime movies , plus about 90 minutes of camera idle time , and they were still at 50 % !	1
These Energizer Rechargeable batteries are very good for people that use items which are generally considered to be battery hogs.These work well in Remote Control toys ( such as RC Helicopters or for video game remotes like the Wii ) . They charge quickly ( time varies depending on the charger and the power level when charging begins , but most charge within two hours for me ) . The only downside is that they seem to lose some power when not in use . This is ok for me , because I just know that I need to charge them up the day before I want to use them , but if you think you can buy these to charge them and then let them sit on a shelf for a month before using , then you will be disappointed.I do n't use these in the TV remote , and I do n't use them for clocks . But they are a great buy for many applications ( including digital cameras , if you have one that runs on AA ) .Overall , these have saved me money , and allowed me to use battery powered items in ways that I would n't have used them had I had to pay for disposable batteries .	1
These batteries were bought as a gift for our great grand children 's toys . They can recharge batteries without having to wait for more batteries and save a lot of expense for the parents , too .	1
I 'm a die hard geocacher - and the best AA batteries I can find for long life are the Energizer Lithium 9x batteries , but they are expensive and it bothers me to dispose of so many batteries ( even recycled ) in a year . SO , I bought two sets of these and a charger and they work well . Not great , but well . I have to change batters in the outdoor GPS twice for a full day of caching whereas I could go all day on the Lithium 9x ones . Sort of an inconvenience , but going green on anything seems to have it 's convenience price tag ... Good batteries . Have the Rayovac rechargeable AA 's as well and these seem to be a LITTLE longer lasting on a full charge .	1
My wife , a dental hygenist , brought home a couple of these , one for us and one for her sister 's family . Everyone likes it . I then bought another from Amazon ( for cheaper than she got it from her office ) for her sister 's young son , who likes it a lot , but wanted one of his own.We 've had ours for close to a year , and we use it every day , usually twice each .	1
It was helpful reading the other reviews , I had to be patient and change the pressure ( 1 to 7 ) quite a few more times than the instructions stated . Once I got pressure , it has worked great since , I have used the product for 3 months , 3 times a day . It works so well I have purchased 3 others for relatives .	1
I bought this as a replacement for a Water Pik flosser and so far I like it . I like how easy it is to take apart . It is a bit louder than my old water pik but the pressure is fine and I like all of the attachments . Good buy !	1
Never once have I received a & # 34 ; dud & # 34 ; from duracell batteries no matter the size . They work the first time , every time , and for a very long time after that . I highly recommend Duracell batteries . Period .	1
I use these batteries every time I turn around . I truster Duracell , The Coppertop batteries . I am well-stocked for all of my remotes	1
I love the brand but the batteries are not that strong . I placed some of them in my TV remote control and they were still going kind of slow .	1
They are 9 Volt batteries and they work ! You can use them to shock little children or something more productive like keeping your family a little safer from smoke/fire/carbon monoxide ... ..your choice .	1
Duracell produces top notch batteries that last longer than any others on the market . My husband would n't consider buying anything else .	1
We continually order batteries and Duracell is usually out choice . They are long lasting and reasonably priced . I would recommend these batteries .	1
I 've had nothing but good luck with Duracell batteries . The radio I installed these in is going strong , several months later .	1
Super battery for the automatic lid opener garbage can . No problems and we 're still using the first two batteries after 5 months .	1
I had flashlights that needed batteries . Now I am prepared for emergencies and everyday use to look at my outdoor thermostat .	1
Typical great quality C batteries you would expect from Duracell . I would obviously buy these again if i needed them !	1
Worth the money and last just as long as can be expected.I have had 4 batteries in two smoke detectors for one year and they still work as directed .	1
Arrived promptly and they do what they 're supposed to do . I 've not had any experience with a failure in any of the batteries I 've purchased online .	1
These are , of course , the well known Duracell Coppertop batteries . What 's not to like ? The shipping was fairly quick , and the batteries arrived as pictured .	1
Duracell 9 volts are the only batteries I use in the wireless microphones we use for our instructional video business . We replace the batteries before every shoot and sometime run for up to 10 hours non-stop . Wireless microphones use a lot of power and we have found that the Duracell batteries can make it through an entire day of shooting , lasting about 25 % longer than the less expensive generic types we tried before.We also use Duracell 9 volts in our smoke detectors at home . They might be more expensive than some , but they are worth it in the long run.Highly recommended !	1
product was what I wanted and they seem to work great . Sometimes you get batteries that are 'old ' , and these have worked great - no issues with them at all .	1
We use these batteries for our timer candles . Duracell always lasts the longest and the purchase from Amazon was the best buy .	1
For me , I use the Duracell Coppertop 9-V Alkaline Batteries for two purposes:1 ) In a older portable FM/AM radio that accepts a 9 volt battery.2 ) My three smoke alarms.Before I discovered the Duracell 9 volt batteries , I used a store brand ( generic ) and sometimes other name brands . All of the generic or cheaper brands did not last long.1 ) Older Generic - In my smoke alarms - they ran out of juice in just 6 months as I discovered when the smoke alarm beeped in the middle of the night.2 ) Radio - The generic and cheap brand lasted about one year , but no more.BELOW IS WHAT IS HAVE RECEIVED WHEN I USE THE DURACELL 9 VOLT:1 ) Smoke Alarms - So now I get at least two to three years ! 2 ) Radio - I still have the Duracell battery in my radio and it is still strong . I placed it into the radio in 2008 so it has been in there for FIVE YEARS . Note , this radio I play when the power is off and bring for emergencies etc.Highly recommend these Duracell Batteries .	1
wo n't put any other batteries in my flameless candles an I have about 30 ! ! great lasting power . go get some .	1
You want a battery that is going to last , then you ca n't go wrong with this one . I bought the 8 count because my garbage can needs 4 and the shelf life of these batteries is so good that I have no doubt it will provide me with the many months of use . Since I have the first 4 still being used , going on 7 months now , I am going to guess at least 1 year before I will need to replace so yes , a good purchase price for this 8 pack .	1
For most people , that 's what you will need these for . And once that stupid thing starts beeping at 3 AM ( I swear its programmed in that way by some sadist at Big Smoke Detector ) , you are going to want to have a 9 volt ready . Because you are not the kind of monster who would let your family burn to death ( well probably smoke to death if we are honest ) cause you were too cheap or lazy to replace the battery . That 's not how you want to get on the local news ( that or & # 34 ; local cat hoarder in Guinness Book of World Records & # 34 ; ) .Given that these have the & # 34 ; Durablock & # 34 ; feature they have a long guaranteed shelf life , so feel free to splurge on this 4 pack of 9 volts . You will be safe , and feel like a big spender .	1
Of all the batteries I use , I really dislike D size . They 're heavy , and I understand that they have to be . So the question was , do I want to spend a small fortune on rechargeable D 's or get the tried an true Duracell D. You know the answer . I use these in one huge flashlight and in two motion sensor lights on our house . I ca n't tell you that these are better than the bunny batteries , but from my experience , these just keep going , and going , and going . Since the motion sensors are used on a nightly basis ( the sensors have picked up raccoons , skunks , and opossums which we did n't even know we had in suburbia ) , I think it 's amazing that we have n't had to replace the batteries yet , and the light is still as strong as ever .	1
I keep batteries in stock at our home . It started when grandkids needed batteries for their toys . Now it is convenient because we are in the country and who knows when the power will go out . I have many candles that are flameless and operate on batteries . Makes life pleasant to not run out .	1
These batteries came quickly and were exactly what I ordered . This line of batteries is a lot more in a brick and mortar store . I like the savings .	1
I really like these . I used these for my mouse and they have lasted a lot longer than regular batteries do .	1
I 've used Duracell batteries for years , and they 've always been reliable . I would like to mention two things that stood out with the most recent D-cell Duracells ( 8-count package ) that I bought in the 8-pack : * The expiration date is December 2023 , more than ten years after I purchased them . * The packaging is some of the best that I 've seen for batteries , and if you do n't need all eight of them now , the packaging also serves as a nice , resealable container . Also , it was extremely easy to open , needing only a small pair of scissors to cut where indicated.I also recently purchased an 8-count package of Duracell C-cells . The same comments apply , except that the packaging is different ( cardboard instead of plastic ) than the packaging the D-cells came in , and the expiration date is only nine years out.Call me a very satisfied customer .	1
Batteries ... they work , they last as expected , no worries , no high praise , good product , safe buy ... looked specifically for `` coppertop '' not disappointed bought for pool vacuum . Thanks	1
I do n't usually write reviews of common household products but I am so impressed with these D batteries that I just had to . I bought these batteries to use use with three motion sensing security lightsMr . Beams MB333 Wireless LED Spotlight with Motion Sensor and Photocell , White , 3-Pack . Amazon must have had them in our local warehouse since I received both the batteries and lights the next day rather than the usual Prime two days.One of my concerns with the battery operated lights was the hassle of constantly changing the batteries . Although two of the three are on the sides of the house in front and wo n't be tripped very often , one is in back and is constantly being tripped by the dogs . Since we put these up at the beginning of October there have been many dark hours and three dogs are constantly tripping it.I read a couple of studies that said a Duracell D battery will only keep a flashlight going for fifteen hours . Even if our security light is only on for a total of ten minutes a day ( in actuality it is more like fifteen or twenty ) , I was resigned to having to change the battery at least every three months if not more often , expecially in winter . We are now into the fifth month and as of this morning , it is still going strong.Based on my experience I am going to stick with the Duracell brand for outdoor applications .	1
Duracell is always my first choice . They always seem to have a great non use time to them . I only use Duracell and have never regretted it since my hot wheels days	1
This is just a battery right ? ( Duracell Coppertop with Duralock ) The D cells I received from Amazon have a expiration date on the battery Dec 2022 . Bought these Dec 2012 , so I get 10years . See photo in customer photo section.Great to see expiration date on battery ! ! NO MORE GUESSING if they 're too old.My D cells came in a plastic box suitable for storage.Price here on Amazon for 8 D cell was much lower than any retail outlet.Good price , fresh batteries . 5 starsShips from and Sold by Amazon	1
Some mornings I have a rough time getting out of bed . I keep one of these on my night stand and give it a quick lick to jump-start my day . Even after a few weeks , it still packs a punch and gets me going ! Not really ... but I 'm sure it would . It 's a battery . It powers things like a battery should . What more do you want from it ?	1
Duracell batteries are my favorite for reliability and endurance . In my opinion , they provide more continuous output than any other competitor battery . The chief competitor , Energizer , does not last as long in my appliances than does the Duracell . So , when I buy batteries , I buy Duracell . This said , be aware of the following facts : Duracell 's cost slightly more than Energizers , so perhaps the Energizers are more economical in the long-run . Second , always check the expiration date on the batteries . If the expiration date is near , return them and ask for the package with the longest expiration date . Finally , store batteries in the refrigerator for longest storage life . Shelf life at room temperature depletes all batteries.kone	1
duracell batteries are the best , i use these in outside motion lights and they last a long time . would recommend	1
Needed to purchase these to power a portable fan . Came well packaged with no damage ( from Amazon proper ) and the expiration date was years in advance . Batteries performed as expected , pricing a bit more than 3 hours of continuous power to a portable fan set on & # 8220 ; high & # 8221 ; ... ... Basically , these are very expensive to use and other types of batteries ( re : rechargeable ) would be a better purchase although there are just times when only a & # 8220 ; D & # 8221 ; Cell will do.As long as there is no visible damage and your exp . date is ok , these Duracell Alkaline Coppertops should perform well . I have never had any trouble with them over the years .	1
Duracell makes a great battery ; and the `` CopperTop '' version of these 9-volt size batteries does indeed last longer than pervious types of 9-volt batteries by Duracell . These batteries always last a good long time after I install them in a smoke alarm I have.Of course , these 9-volt batteries can be used in anything that requires them -- not just smoke alarms . Moreover , the reclosable storage pack actually does close neat and clean for you so that the batteries remaining inside the package do n't get dusty or exposure to any elements if you 're outside camping or something.Use these batteries before their expiration date . The expiration date will always be several years into the future ; but some people still have them lying around in a dresser drawer anyway . The problem is not only do they lose their potency ; the batteries also begin to corrode.Do NOT dispose of these or ever place these in or near a fire . They could indeed explode . I would n't carry them loose either -- they should be protected in their cardboard case or they should be already installed in your smoke alarm , your tape recorder or whatever device you placed them into.Overall , these Duracell CopperTop 9-volt size batteries are the ones to choose if you need 9-volt size batteries . I highly recommend them for any device that needs 9-volt size batteries .	1
We use Duracell batteries size & # 34 ; C & # 34 ; in our LED window candle lights and we get about 105 days of use out of them . We tried Energizers , but we only got about 90-92 days use out of them . Get these on subscribe & save and you will rarely be out of batteries .	1
Ca n't really say much about these batteries as they last a long time . I have never had any problems with Duracell batteries so will continue to buy them .	1
There 's not a lot you can say , these are excellent , they do just what you want them too and have a good length of life .	1
There is a reviewer who specializes in reviewing batteries and does a very , very thorough , erudite and insightful job of it . So it is with utmost temerity and respect that I tread these waters . I am the last person on earth to demean batteries . I mean , where would we be without them ? No flashlights , no little handfans . No smoke detectors . Can you imagine a world where you had to get off the couch to change the TV channel ? I remember those days and it was hell . No , we need batteries . Without batteries , our favorite gizmos would be useless ... but how do you tell them apart ? The Duracells certainly look authoritative and batterylike . They dropped right into the battery-compartment of the battery-operated lantern without a fight , making a rather satisfying thudding sound as they hit bottom . I am happy to report that they did not explode , burst info flame or display any other bad battery behavior . I remember in the old days , batteries would sometimes Go Rogue on you . You 'd open up the flashlight and all sorts of bubbly gray gook would be erupting from them and it was pretty disgusting . I have never seen a Duracell do this , but to be fair , I have seen no other battery do it either , not for many , many years . Obviously we have come a long , long way in terms of Battery technology.The D , by the way was plainly marked , so there could be no mistake ... although the size is a dead give away . In the box with your other batteries , they are like Orson Welles in a room full of Don Knotts . So were the little Plus and Minus signs , so you would know which end went in first . Although they could have been a little bigger , now that I think of it . A lot bigger . But none of the other batteries offer this large print , so I wo n't take away any stars.Dura-Cell implies `` Durable '' so I expected a tough battery -- but really , how tough does it have to be ? I 'm not kicking it across the road before it goes into the flashlight , am I ? So duration is really the only thing to measure , beyond the other factors previously mentioned . Now I know some batteries claim to last longer , the energizer bunny and all that , but I always forget to time them and sometimes you use a flashlight or a gizmo more and sometimes you use it less , so it 's hard to judge . I 'm assuming if one really did outperform all the others , it would be common knowledge , but it 's not , so I just have to go by what I can in terms of rating . On the other hand , I did buy a four pack of batteries for a buck at the 99 Cent Store . I think they were call Emmagizers , so naturally I was fooled . They were not a good choice and I would warn anyone planning to stock up on batteries with names similar to name brands to think twice , particularly if they are intended for your Pacemaker . So , five stars for a battery that fits into the battery compartment , sports a very manly and handsome combination of bronze and black colors , and so far has given me all that I dare hope for from a battery.One question : Would n't it just be easier to have one size battery because invariably , when you have a bunch of As in the junk drawer , the flashlight that burns out requires Cs , and when you buy C cells , the next Gizmo needs Ds . And it does n't matter anyway because when you get to the store , you never remember which size it was you needed and buy the wrong size . And those little guys , the AAs ? What 's the story with them ? How many penlights are we carrying around already . And do n't get me started on those square guys . And while we 're at it , how come there are no B cell batteries ? One more thing ... those big gigantic flashlights that need the big BIG square battery ... the battery alone always costs more than when you buy the flashlight with the battery . SOmething fish going on there if you ask me.This whole battery thing is starting to look suspicious ... like it 's all being rigged by some international battery cartel . I could explore this possibility more but the cat is now fighting me for control of the keyboard and the only wise thing to do is to log off . Good night .	1
No problem with the expiration date as report by others - have 2020 date . Popped them in - work fine . Good price . Prefer Duracell so appreciate the saving .	1
What can i say they are Duracell and they work . I bought a deal from Amazon that was for outdoor lights that are battery powered and these fit the bill perfectly	1
i have discovered that buying batteries on amazon is a lot more economical than going in-store . i will forever buy batteries online since these were exactly as described .	1
The price is great and the batteries last a long time . We are very happy with this product . It is a good buy .	1
I purchased quite a few toys over Christmas that required batteries . Luckily Amazon has batteries at a low price in large bulk to cover my needs.The batteries show up in Amazons no frills frustration free packaging with an expiration date several days out . Other individuals , unfortunately , have received batteries near or past their expiration date as well as less than acceptable packaging . I would do two things:1 ) Make sure when you are ordering the batteries that you are ordering from amazon itself and not one of the other vendors that may pop up replacing amazon.2 ) When you receive the batteries make sure you check the expiration date of the batteries and , if you have a volt checker , test the batteries.Overall a good deal on a wide variety of sizes and quantities .	1
If you can wait a couple days for your batteries , buy them here ! They are a lot cheaper on amazon and the more you buy the cheaper the price . These are true D size Duracell batteries , not your generic style . Great buy ! Also if you have amazon prime they shop for free and you save gas money/time .	1

Ordered them for my home alert ! I store extras in the refrigerator . I have read that it helps preserve them for quite awhile longer than shelf storage .	1
Now I do n't know what to say other than yes they were batteries and they were charged when I got them .	1
The price is good , they work . I 've never had a Duracell not do its duty in all the decades I 've been using them . Many even run for years , well past the & # 34 ; guaranteed to hold the charge by & # 34 ; date .	1
What can I say about the batteries but the are batteries and work just fine and last a long time . You can not go wrong with Duracell .	1
What can you say about a battery ? They work and were sent as new . I really do n't know the life of batteries , but this brand always seems to last longer .	1
Bought a 4-pack , used 3 , the 4th sits waiting to be noticed some 2 years later . No idea if it 's still usable , but I doubt there 's much of a charge left in there .	1
These came factory sealed and were brand new . They are going strong just as I expect them to . I have never had a problem with Duracell batteries lastly well longer than actually needed . Great product .	1
In typical Duracell fashion , these are great batteries . They last long once in a product , do not tend to leak and have a great shelf life according to the expiration date stamped on each battery .	1
We live overseas and rarely receive packages on times but these came really fast and work great so far . Great deal too .	1
These are D Batteries . I do not know what else there is comment about them other than the pricing of them is better than a retail store .	1
Yes , batteries deserve a review too . Been using these copper tops for years . Not sure why . I guess I just like the copper top thing . Do they last longer than Ever-readies ? ? I have no idea . FOUR FREAKING STARS FOR BATTERIES !	1
performs as advertised and value priced . what more could you ask ? i will deinitely order more of this product . i do n't know if this has dura-lock	1
I was out of these c batteries so I thought I would look around and check the price and how long it takes to get them . Amazon is very fast .	1
Duracell batteries are Duracell batteries I assume . It was time to replace the smoke detector batteries and this was a great deal .	1
Only good things to say here : ordered these on a Friday and they arrived on Monday ( prime/free shipping ) - got ta love Amazon ! The Duracell brand is always reliable for me . I compared prices with the `` mart '' and the day I purchased them they were about 20 % cheaper here . The box states fresh through 2017 . Works exactly as advertised.Pleased with this purchase and highly recommended .	1
What can you say about batteries . Duracell are dependable , last well . I always use Duracell for important things such as smoke detector .	1
These batteries are the longest lasting . I use them for my timer candles . Love ordering and having them in here in 2 days , instead of running out to buy them .	1
i love the flameless candles and have quite a lot and it is always great to get these batteries each month on subscribe and save . i never run out .	1
I use these for garage door openers -- have found that even though Duracell is more expensive , they last way the heck longer than the Rayovacs you can get 1/2 price at Shop-Rite.A bit cheaper on Amazon relative to in-store purchase .	1
Duracell 9-V Alkaline Batteries , 4-Count , ( Packaging May Vary ) I have used Duracell products over the years and have been and still pleased .	1
Arrived quickly and work as they should ! No issues here . Would recommend ordering these batteries for all your battery needs .	1
Amazon continues to have all the producs I have wanted or needed for everything I could think of . The battgeries speak for themselves as Copper Top batteries . They are guarenteed for 10 years when you get them . Easy to order , receive , and all from one place , & # 34 ; Amazon & # 34 ; , and the price was perfect . Always look to Amazon for your needs .	1
I HAVE A HIGH RATING FOR ALL DURACELL BATTRIES . THEY LAST A LONG TIME AND ARE VERY DEPENDABLE . I KEEP DURACELLS ON HAND AT ALL TIMES AAA , AA , C AND D 'S .	1
This was a good price and very convenient . I expect these will work as well as the batteries we buy at the grocery store .	1
Expiration is 2018 , I 'm happy . I ca n't think of too many more words to say so I 'll just say , `` yadda yadda yadda '' .	1
These were just what I needed to restock my supply of batteries . They are dependable and the price was right .	1
This item arrived when promised , was well packaged and therefore undamaged . The price is reasonable , and the fit is perfect in my devices . So far it has my flashlights working as they should . I Recommend this product .	1
Purchased for use in the two smoke alarms . The perform as expected . The alarms never fail to go off during my brain failures while cooking .	1
Many of the battery-powered devices you use in your home are powered most efficiently by CopperTop batteries . Always trust the Copper Top for your power needs .	1
I bought these to use in a blow up matterss . great price for a size that is hard to find . Especially hard to find in a large pack . Duracell is a very reliable brand .	1
Does it 's job at a cheap price . I like having 4 batteries on hand instead of 1 when those smoke alarms start beeping when the battery dies .	1
Whats to say about batteries ? I hav n't used them long enough to wear them down even if they were defective . I always use Duracell in this type of product . The 8 pk is real nice to have ; I do n't expect to ever have to buy a D cell again .	1
I 'm an electrical engineer . The amount of power available from an alkaline battery is almost directly proportional to its size . You do n't see many D size batteries used these days ( they are fairly large and heavy ) but they certainly hold a lot more power than the equivalent AA or AAA batteries.These batteries can be a bit hard to find locally and I was thankful to find them on Amazon at a very fair price.The batteries were fresh and the printed expiration date was over ten years away.Recommended	1
Let 's face it , Duracell has successfully branded themselves as the best battery around . And the truth is , I get the best results with them over any other . They last long , and can keep sustained power for a host of electronics , from cutting edge to the cheapest toy . Any time I use a bargain brand to save money , I 'm quickly reminded that I 'm not really saving much , since they die so fast . So I keep a supply of cheapo batteries on hand for things that do n't matter and do n't drain a lot of juice . Duracells , I save for the important stuff , flashlights , radios , emergency essentials . What good is saving a few cents if I 'm left in a pinch during an emergency ? With all the little gadgets I got squawking for juice , I just wish these Duracells cost a little less . But every once in a while , Amazon has a digital coupon available , and that , coupled with Subscribe & Save , does help . Other than Duracell , AmazonBasics makes a great battery ; but only in AA and AAA . No 9v that I know of.Bottom Line -- do you really want to trust something important , like a fire detector , to a cheapo battery ? I do n't . That 's why I got these .	1
They are batteries . They are Duracell . There are 8 and they are D size . What more is there to say ?	1
Always good to have extra 9v on hand when the time changes . Cheapest insurance in the world versus your house burning down .	1
Buying this battery just saved me a trip to local stores . However its price is not far off from local.So if you just want to put in Add-on or being lazy , go for this , otherwise buying locally is not a bad choice .	1
I ca n't always make it out of the house to get batteries and I do n't usually have a D batteries on hand . This was a good price and easy way to get them .	1
These were a good price and are still going in some per lit LED floral arrangements I have n't turned since Christmas .	1
Duracell batteries may cost double what Energizer batteries cost but from my experience they are much more reliable , last longer and are well made . I only buy Duracell now and find them much better . I just put four of these batteries in my new radio and am very happy with them.~The Rebecca Review	1
Got these Duracell D batteries at a good price . Hard to review something like this disposable item but I 've always been a Duracell user and find Duracells to be a good value . If you find these at a good price , buy it ! Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you , it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews , and leave a comment if you have any questions , I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help .	1
Duracell is normally my go-to battery , although I 'll buy Energizers if I can find them on sale . A battery is pretty much a battery , and Duracell has never let me down .	1
The Duracell 'D ' batteries are much less expensive through Amazon than anywhere else . I bought 3 sets and with free shipping , that 's a big saving.I 've never had a Duracell battery leak on me . Normally , I only use rechargeable batteries but I wanted batteries that did n't discharge over time ( and 24 rechargeable 'D ' batteries are very expensive ) for use inMr Beams MB360 Wireless LED Spotlight with Motion Sensor and Photocell - Weatherproof - Battery Operated - 140 Lumens	1
What can I say ? They are batteries . I like Duracell ... they seem to last a bit longer than Energizer . Go Duracell .	1
In general , Duracell and Enrrgizer perform significantly better than more generic battrries in terms of battery life . Yhese are no exception . I used them in a stompbox , and even though this is primsrily for practice and jamming , i do n't want interruptions to change the batteries . These do n't disappoint.The pricing of Duracell on Amazon has also been much better than I can get locally . Before I bought these , I tried three drugstores and one supermarket to see ifIi could pick up a better deal . It was n't possible . The batteries I could find locally were runnng almost twice as much as these Duracells on Amazon . As long ss that remains the case , I will continue to buy online .	1
I have been very pleased with the purchase of duracell batteries . Will definitely purchase these batteries again . purchase them you wo n't be diasappointed	1
I must say that this brand of batteries last a very long time . I do n't usually have to buy C batteries , unless they are for my son 's toys . I would recommend this product .	1
I have been playing the Guitar for over 40 years , 24 of those years Professionally . I have a large number of Electric Guitars with EMG Active Pickups , Duracell has never let me down !	1
they work well in my sons bouncy seat by far the most used item in our house that we forget to turn off and these are good batteries that last my pack has lasted over 6 months and still have a few	1
I did not try these . I just included these in a package to supplement the ones in a toy I sent my grandaughter .	1
They 're batteries . Good batteries . Use them in electronic devices . What more can I say ? Here are the six more words .	1
I 've always been partial to Duracell . They have done me well for 40 years . These are no exception . Not always the cheapest but I got a good deal here .	1
These are duracell C batteries in an eight count package . Delivered right to my door . They are the regular batteries the same you can get from the store I assume . I have had no issues with them at all . Would purchase again when needed .	1
The name `` Maglite '' has always been , to me synonymous with quality -- I 've been wearing this one on my belt for several years now . It 's small , light-weight and has a powerful light for something this small . The beam is quite bright for a flashlight this size , and the `` candle '' mode is a nifty feature ( especially when the end of the flashlight fits into the upended top ) .It helped me more than once , especially when in a crowded elevator during a minor power outage . My parting comment to all who were in this elevator with me - `` Why did n't YOU have a flashlight with you ? `` My ONLY gripe -- the nylon belt-sheath , which is durable -- not only allows the flashlight to fall out in some situations , but it does not keep the rotating head of the flashlight protected . More than once someone has come up to me to say `` Umm ... . your BELT is all lit up ! ! '' I solved that problem by sewing a ( rip-stopped ) strip of nylon onto the top of the sheath ( back to front ) , and attaching velcro to the end of the strip and to the front of the sheath , so now my maglite stays securely in the sheath.Would I buy aother Maglite ? Sure ! I 'd like to eventually buy the whole family of Maglites -- from tiny to huge . They do the job and do it well .	1
The literature advertises 5 hours 15 minutes of battery life from 2 AA alkalines , but I get around 7 hours.The candle mode is handy , but it 's a tad fussy to reconfigure the flashlight back and forth between normal and candle mode and back .	1
was pleasantly surprised upon delivery that the flashlight had a xenon bulb . LED is also an option but is more expensive . the flashlight is well built and the candle mode is unique - comes in handy during camping trips .	1
I bought this for my husband and he loves it ! It is light and great for him to use quick at work or hand free if need be ! The light is bright and a great buy !	1
I had a light on my shotgun which quit working so instead of replacing it with the same fifty dollar one this fit in the same way as the old one . This one cost $ 8 .	1

A Christmas gift for 2 young boys who love to wander thru the woods near their house at night . They have found goblins , trolls , werewolves , and lions , tigers , and bears ... . ( if you wish to believe their tales ! ) They are small in size but very , very bright and the light projects for a great distance . We can sit on our back porch and tell about where they are by watching the light beam in the trees.They now also turn our couches upside down to make a tent and use their lights to read and play by . They do that even in the daylight ! The batteries have not yet been replaced after many hours of use . They made a great gift and got them away from the TV and computer games . That is the biggest benefit in my opinion .	1
I 've used the convential sized Maglights , which last a lifetime , but i wanted a smaller version , and found it in this item ... it works superbly , throws out a powerful beam of light , and is small enough to carry in your pocket ... ..love it .	1
As an usher at a music school , I needed to keep a flash light on my person . This was the perfect solution . It is mini but still powerful , and the holster is perfect for attaching to the belt , keeping it securely in place .	1
I 've been purchasing Maglite flashlights for years and years . The quality is among the best out there . I also have a 3 cell & # 34 ; D & # 34 ; battery Maglite which is really bright with a great beam . You ca n't go wrong with Maglite !	1
I was looking for this Maglite . But the other ones I saw was priced higher than this one . And this one even came with accessories . The price is really nice to fine . I ended up buying two of them .	1
I had the same one before..too I lost it ... I work in a machine shop , running computer and CNC ... that Flashlight came in handle all the time ... now am in a nursing home ... I never know if I need one in my room or for the hall ways ... I live in Florida ... we do have Hurricanes	1
I own a bunch of these and they are great little lights . 2 AA batteries last a long time- I dont use mine everyday so it 's hard to say how long batteries last . But using my several times a week , they can last 5-6 weeks . sometime longer .	1
Bought this for myself which I think is a reliable brand . It is the compact size that I wanted for my purpose .	1
What can I say ? Maglite is always great and this is just the right size to keep in my nightstand drawer to have in case of a power failure .	1
This is the traditional incandescent Mini Maglite that has been used and loved for several decades now . While it is not expensive ( $ 11 , 14 lumens ) , the old incandescent light bulb technology lacks in many aspects when compared to the new LED technology . If you still like the Maglite design , they offer three Mini Maglite LED technologies ; the Mini Maglite LED ( $ 16 , 77 lumens ) , Mini Maglite LED Pro ( $ 20 , 226 lumens ) , and the Mini Maglite LED Pro Plus ( $ 24 , 245 lumens bright mode ) .I found a Mini Maglite once tossed on the side of a rural road at a sharp turn . One can only imagine how it got there . Regardless , the body had some deep scores and dents in it , as if it rolled quite far and maybe even got run over a time or two . I was definitely surprised when I turned the head ( it still turned smoothly and easily ) and the light turned on , dim and yellow , of course , but steady . I took it home and added it to one of my emergency kits . Unfortunately , I placed bad batteries in it , which swelled up and corroded , causing problems with the springs inside . It was not too much of a loss as it was obtained for free , but the Maglite itself was great while it lasted.I plan on getting the Pro Plus as my primary EDC flashlight as it is made in the USA , to replace my cheap Ultrafire AA flashlight which has been showing random switch issues . While still quite outdated ( Maglite is just catching up with the Mag-tac line ) , the price for the Pro Plus is about one half to one third of the price one would pay for a full-feature tactical light from 4Sevens , Fenix , or Zebralight , which despite their steep prices are all made in China.However , if you have a sentimental attachment to the dim yellow beam of a USA-made Maglite , buy it . Otherwise , get one of the LED models .	1
love my little mag .	1
It has a & # 34 ; torch & # 34 ; feature where you can take the top off and set it up for hands free like a candle and it is small enough for my purse which I like because you never know when you need a flashlight and you do n't want to use up your cell phone batteries	1
Grey is my favorite color . When purchasing mini-Mags for the company , I noticed the grey variety and ... glee ! It has a nice , dull shine to it , and it works like a Mag . Score ! Plus , a holster !	1
Maglite flashlights are renowned for their top-notch quality , their waterproof / water resistant design , and their extremely durable and corrosion-resistant aircraft grade aluminum casing . The Maglite AA Mini Flashlight ( model : M2A01H ) is no exception.Pros -- -- - Comes with a HolsterThe holster has a loop for threading a belt through .

I was taking part in a filmmaking seminar in Maine , and everyone had two tools : a Mini Maglite and aLeatherman . They all wore them on their belts , and they came in handy on numerous occasions . Of course I picked one up and I love the little holster that comes with it . If it did n't look dorky I 'd probably wear this and a multi-tool all the time.It 's not just good for night use . Changing a fuse , adjusting equipment , finding something under the desk . For those kinds of everyday , all-the-time uses , the Mini Mag is much more handy and useful than the largerMAGLITE , which I also own and keep in my closet for emergencies and camping . Highly recommended for its simplicity , utility , and durability .	1

These are great little , indestructible , basically bullet proof flashlights that go just about everywhere with us . We have them in our car glove boxes , boat cabinet and under every sink in our house . There 's a longer one near our front door that serves as a bright torch and also a defensive baton if need be.Carry one in my range bag too , as it lights up just what i need it too in order to make those fine adjustments.Highly recommended .	1
We have been buying these Maglite Mini flashlights for quite a while . I have yet to try their LED version , but for now these work perfectly for me . I know that the LED one is supposedly much better , but at this price point , I have a very hard time passing these up.We probably must have about 3 or 4 of these around our home , and I personally keep 1 in every toolbag or toolbox . With the cheap price of these you can have one in every room and anywhere else you can think of . You also have a wide variety of colors to choose from , but I stick to the modest , classic black annodized.I know that this is just a review for a simple flashlight , but I believe Maglite to be the best , and I hope this review helps .	1
focus-able beam is nice . I had already bought a TeraLUX ministar2 extreme upgrade for my existing mag and liked it so much I decided to buy this to put it in a less scratched up case . for a conventional bulb the stock bulb is not very bright and unless you have a led module for it already or know enough about electronics to make one I would buy the mini mag LED . If you do know enough about electronics you can buy led lights , cut the leads and add your own heat sink for fairly cheap from parts here on amazon , I did this to my old mini mag ( you can find instructions on instructables ) and not as bright as the TeraLUX but 2-3 times brighter than stock for $ 2 in parts .	1
I have been a fan of Maglite as long as I can remember . I do n't want a flashlight that breaks easily because when I need it , I NEED IT . The Maglite line has alway been durable and solid and feels good in the hand . The design is well thought out like the `` candle mode '' to light a space.This package has a nice holster , but it is small enough to fit easily in most pockets . Over the years I never had to replace the halogen bulb in a maglite but they typicall provide one spare in the bottom just in case . That kind of thoughtful reliablity plus nice design make this as great as the bigger ones.There are two of these in my house plus a LED model too . In my opinion this mini-maglite does everything I need very reliably . I can depend on it when it counts.Hope this helps someone .	1
Works exactly like it should . This is our all-around pocket-sized flashlight . It 's bright enough to candle eggs with or see pretty far on a dark night . It 's also really durable . As a klutz , I can tell you it withstands being dropped on a pretty regular basis .	1
I think this is much better than regular little flashlights . Good light , adjustable beam ! Just do n't let little kids play with it . My son broke my first one .	1
flash light is rugged and for what I paid it was a steal , it shines beam well over 100ft at night enough you can make out images in dark , best little light to have on hand and you can even hold with teeth if need be when changing a flat at night or expand beam to cover larger area , its best buy for quality that you can buy and shop amazon for best deal .	1
mini lite was just the right size for me to use when I am fixing or repairing something and need a different size of light rays to see something tiny or in detail . The size of the barrel of the flashlight is great for my hands when I need both of them to use and can just use my fingers to grasp instead of the whole hand . Brightness of bulb is excellent since you can adjust the rays to be full or small to see just the focus of something detail . Light also came with an upholster to store and wear on your body so you can carry for camping use or hiking use or even for your work when needed . It is convenient to have in a holder so you do n't have to hand carry it . Great product for the price you pay .	1
Bought this exclusively for my travel kit . A very sharp light to keep me from crashing into furniture/luggage as I make my way to the bathroom at night . Also , the battery is lasting longer than some earlier maglites I have owned . Nice !	1
Purchased a year go and love this little flashlight . I have it hanging on my front door ona little hook , so I always know where it is . Used it too many times to count , so nice to have one around . And AA batteries last forever , still have not changed mine.Candle feature is so useful as well . If people ask me what flashlight to get , I immediately point to this Maglite .	1
This Bucket And Wringer Is Great For mopping Up Your Basement And Garage . It Makes Mopping Up An Easy Task .	1
This bucket and wringer are wonderful . It is sturdy and large enough to do the job without being too big and heavy . Using with my new O ' Cedar fiber mop makes the task of mopping my floors quick and easy . I would definitely recommend this mop bucket with wringer .	1
This is a good mop bucket except I thought there would be some kinkd of lever or handle that would squeeze out the water . It did not have that . Even though that was missing , the mop was not dripping wet when used . Thats why I gave it 4 stars .	1
This big pack was a huge problem solver for us . We do n't have a car so we navigate the shopping chores carefully . We are within walking distance of many different stores and we do have a hardware store nearby but the usual purchase of a regular box was used quickly which meant constantly walking to the hardware store for refills . Buying these has been a big relief for me , since I do most of the walking . I am still using these and it has been MONTHS . I will do this every time . The price is not painful and the large number of bags makes it a real deal .	1
I love these bags . Since my local supermarket stopped carrying them I drive a long way out of the way to another branch that still does just to get these . I 'd buy them online , but they 're a lot cheaper at the supermarketI do use them in a can that 's slightly smaller than 13 gallons , so I do n't care if they ca n't be filled with exactly 13 gallons of garbage . What I like about them is : ( 1 ) they are very strong - I have never had a puncture or a rip , even when I had sharp objects like broken glass in them ; ( 2 ) they do n't have drawstrings , which I absolutely HATE . I love the tie-flaps ; they make a much tighter seal than drawstrings ever can , and they never break or pull out when you try to tighten them as drawstrings tend to do.If somebody knows of cheap , strong kitchen bags without drawstrings that are better than these , please share them ; but they ca n't come from Costco because the closest Costco is more than 100 miles away and in Canada , and I do n't have a passport .	1
I have been using these bags for a while , and they work just fine . I plan to continue using them , and I would recommend them .	1
I am the dishwasher in my home , and I like good tools . It 's been a slog to find a truly good dish brush , and here it is . I used the amazon.com info and went to Ace and found the same brush sold individually . Bought one , and have been using it now for two months . It cleans very well , is easy to keep from getting clogged , and it does n't splay out bristles very much . I 've trimmed off about half a dozen bristles all in all , and the brush still has a lot of life left in it . The UPC at Ace for the individual brush is 0 4130104554 3 . I like this brush enough to think that I 'll buy the dozen-pack when this one gets too far gone . Washing dishes with a good brush makes a lot of difference .	1
Review for : Rubbermaid Dish BrushA review for the humble dish brush . I 'm not sure what it is about this one but I prefer doing dishes with it more than the many other kitchen dish brushes I 've tried from various retail stores and supermarkets . I 'll gladly waste time looking for this one buried in the sink before using another one just sitting there looking at me longingly.Like a car that lets you still feel the road , the bristles are flexible and unbunched enough you can get hard pressure right into the problem spots . Flip it around and you get nice scraping action . Use it with your hand close to the brush to get control as you target the corners and tough spots.This same flexibility means it wo n't look like new pretty fast compared to the ones with stiff bunched up bristles , however even scrunched up it still continues to work great . So hats off to this simple , classic rubbermaid dish brush standing the test of time .	1
I switched back and forth between these and the duracells . They both seem to perform well , however I do tend to think the copper tops last a bit longer , but they are also more expensive so it is a trade off .	1
work fine , fast shipping	1
From reading previous reviews others have had problems with getting old batteries . FYI , I received batteries which will expire in 2018 , in the original Energizer Max packaging .	1
I used these when I went on a month long safari . Had no chance of resupply and did not want to take too many standard batteries as I found in my experience that the high humidity , despite being in a tight container , drained most of the charge before I used them . Took two sets of these lithium AA plus other brands as backup . Did n't need them as the one set in my camera and one set in my recorder were still working good after I had returned . They endured over 100F to a 32F at night , 90 % humidity , heavy rain , damn mosquitoes ( ah..wait..that was my gripe ) and worked very well . Did not have a problem with having to wait for them to recharge my units like other cheaper brands .	1
What can I say , look at the amp hour rating and that says it all . These are the only way to go .	1
The flat discharge curve of lithiums means they will stay above the UVLO ( Under-Voltage Lock Out ) conditions of your electronics power supplies . Today 's electronics do not just keep working until all the juice is gone . They monitor the input voltage and when it drops too low to guarantee a stable output , they shut off . Normal batteries may still have some juice left in them but nothing other than flashlights can really make use of it . Lithiums go most of the way from full health to death in a relatively flat curve so your electronics will get longer life . Maybe only 10 % to 15 % wasted energy left when done compared to 40 % +The price is worth it .	1
Good long lasting AA batteries sold at a good price on Amazon ... not always available in the stores at home or abroad ; I carry a bag of these when traveling overseas to put in my little camera , head lamp , etc ... they last and last ... .	1
I put these batteries in a battery-driven can opener . Nickel Cadmium batteries were not holding up more than a couple of weeks . These Lithium Ion batteries have been in use for about three weeks now , and I have not noticed any loss of power . I 'd buy these batteries again .	1
A very good brand and product . It holds a charge . Not like the lithium , but works just the same . Again with the minimum .	1
These are the best batteries money can buy . They last forever in my Garmin GPS ( at least 3 battery changes versus alkaline ) , and weigh nothing . It 's a perfect use ... keeps the unit super light for clipping to my backpack , and can go all day for several days without replacing .	1
Assuming that this is the equivalent of the Energizer Lithium aaa battery , it is phenominal . I have been using them on my MuVo mp3 player , and they last far , far , far longer than regular batteries . The only problem is that they are hard to find because they are so new .	1
Less than $ 2 a battery and it lasts a lot longer than regular Energizer . I use these in my wireless optical mouse and in my MAGLITE flashlight . Will also purchase lithium ion batteries for my thermostat and fire detectors .	1
I did n't buy these on Amazon , but I was so happy with the performance of these batteries , I had to add my review here.I recently inherited an old Olympus Camedia E-1 digital SLR Camera , and as I soon realized , the camera eats regular batteries at an astounding rate . The normal batteries I had at home were lasting for maybe a dozen shots before they would completely die . I ordered some rechargeable lithium batteries from Amazon , but I needed an inexpensive set of batteries that would get me though for a few days until the rechargeables arrived . So , I went down to my local office supply store , and picked up a 4-Pack of Energizer Lithium batteries hoping that they would do the trick . They did . I did a lot of shooting over the weekend that I was waiting for my rechargeable batteries to arrive , and I even used the LCD display occasionally to shoot with and to review my photos ( something that , on this camera , would make other batteries die instantly ) . But the Energizers continued to work great.A week later , I had my rechargeables , but the energizers were still working , so I decided to keep them in until they died . I have n't done a whole lot of shooting ... mostly a few shots here and there on weekends , as I get used to how the camera works . I was surprised when the batteries lasted through another weekend . Then another , then another . These batteries literally got me through two months of casual weekend shooting ( say , a couple dozen shots or more per weekend ) , even with the LCD display on . For a relatively inexpensive set of `` throwaway '' batteries , and knowing how poorly other batteries performed with this camera , I could n't have been happier with the performance of these . The Energizer Lithium batteries gave me serious bang for my buck.I 'm absolutely sold on these batteries , and will definitely be buying more as backups to my rechargeable set .	1
In an outside sensor for an indoors weather station , these batteries rock . I spent years with my outside weather readings coming and going before I read the manual and saw that they now suggest Lithium batteries . Stuck a pair of these dudes into the remote sensor and have not had a problem in cold weather . With the Duracells , and I love Duracells , I was always loosing my outside temperatures anywhere below 30 degrees ( F ) . So far I have gotten to -4 ( F ) with no dropouts . Very nice .	1
These lithium batteries are great . They are long lasting , lightweight and work great in freezing temperatures . Their `` BEST BY '' date is often ten years or more . If you have a device in a fridge or freezer or outside where it gets cold/freezing , then these are very useful since alkaline batteries will often fail in cold temperatures . They are also useful for devices that are inconvenient to change batteries , like clocks or wireless outdoor temperature or motion sensors . If you 're wealthy , then you might as well use these instead of alkaline or rechargeables , but because of the relatively high cost , I only use these for `` special '' applications . Otherwise I use alkalines or Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries .	1
Since the nearest Walmart is 70 miles away , I was happy to find this battery on Amazon at a comparable price -- with fast shipping ! It is a long-life battery that works great in my outdoor sensor for my thermometer . With temperatures reaching below zero much of the winter here , I want a battery that lasts . This one does !	1
Great batteries ! ! The only kind I use for my digital cameras . Last a long time compared to regular alkaline ones .	1
I purchased these as open box for $ 14.95 with free Prime 2-day shipping . I received two unopened packages of five each NEW Lithium AA batteries . They all test as new.Careful Amazon shoppers : keep their eyes open for deals like this .	1
These batteries hold up well to high demand electronics like my digital camera . I wo n't use the rechargeable batteries any longer .	1
The combination of long battery life and light weight suit these lithium cells uniquely for hand held devices such as wireless mice . Pop them in your wireless mouse and say goodbye to grip fatigue . Your mouse will be light as a feather .	1
These batteries really let you drain every little bit out of them . Make sure you use them in the correct devices , as others mentioned . They worked great in a digital camera w/ flash . I tried to use them in a headlamp - and they did n't fair so well . However even after I thought they were dead , if you let them `` sit '' for a little while , you can come back and get a little more life out of them ( few more shots/flash , light , etc ) . It was kind of funny how many times the camera would power off , and I 'd let it sit for an hour and come back to find there was some juice back in them . If you have a high drain electronic device or you need longevity/cold temps in your battery - then definitely give these a try . However if you have more average/lower draw electronics , these may not seem to last as long and can be quite expensive comparatively to alkalines .	1
Buy , but shop for sales . CHECK EXPIRATION DATES . THERES ALOT OF OLD STOCK OUT THERE	1
the advantages of lithiums over alkalines are plenty . while lithiums do cost more than alkalines , the biggestadvantage lithiums have over alkalines are shelf life and operating life especially in extreme cold temperatures.other lithium advantages are 35 % less weight and most of all , no leakages ( unlike alkalines ) which is especiallyimportant since leaking alkalines can cause product damage as well as personal injury thus making lithiums saferthan alkalines as well .	1
I got these batteries specifically for my wife 's digital camera and have been pleased with their performance to this point . When I first tested them on my battery tester they pegged the needle with their power ; I 've never seen another battery do that.They 've been in my wife 's camera now for several weeks and I test them again before we take it out for use and each time they 've showed a full charge which has surprised me . If anything develops noteworthey I 'll update my review but so far they have exceeded my expectations .	1
I love these batteries ! Something to consider tho , is that a Warehouse Club 48-pack of regular 2800ma alkalines are about the same price . So for low-current applications where maximum life , cold weather performance , weight , etc . is n't critical , there are much more cost-effective choices.AND speaking of critical , I had a little digital safe at the office ( for postage stamps , the checkbook , spare car keys , and such ) that ran on AA 's . I used it for years on regular alkalines and replaced them every 3 months or so . When the alkalines got low , it would still weakly open 5 or 10 times to give me plenty of time to change them . When I switched to a set of these lithiums ( to reduce how often I had to do the replacement procedure ) they lasted just over twice as long , BUT when they died , they were totally gone-ola . I think they 're way better at putting out full voltage to the end - which is ordinarily what you want out of a battery , unless you lock the manual-opening keys in the safe itself !	1
They sent them quick when I ordered , they so far aredoing great in my camera . I hope they continue to lastas long as the literature with the camera says they will . If so , I will be happy , will only have to purchase them once a year .	1
I have always used alkaline batteries . I 'm lucky if the alkaline batteries last 20 minutes . Now , I can use my camera for longer periods of time . I take digital photographs and shoot videos . I am very happy with this purchase .	1
They DO keep going and going and going . These have more power and yet are lighter in weight than your typical battery , AND they hold their charge for 10 years .	1
When I ca n't use rechargeable batteries for my electronic gadgets , I will choose these batteries for their longer life ( and lighter weight does n't hurt either ) .	1
We have sensors for temperature and humidity in our attic . We found that regular batteries do not work well in the cold of Maine winters . Buy these Lithium batteries has made a huge difference . The extra cost is absorbed by their longevity.Here 's my TIP on those attic sensors or transmitters : TIP : I did find it best to purchase and use & # 34 ; Energizer Ultimate Lithium & # 34 ; AA cells . Not only do these last longer but are not really affected by the hot or freezing temperatures found in attics ( and you do n't need to climb up there to replace batteries every couple of months ) .	1
When you have those items that are used everyday I prefer lithium over the less expensive regular batteries especially in items like a PC mouse , TV remote , various camera 's and separate flashes , certain flashlights ... .just remember that heat is the enemy of anything reliant upon battery power .	1
I got tired of having batteries fade out on me when I needed them the most . Also frustrating is constantly having to keep a supply and having to change them often . These lithium batteries last longer than any others and I use them wherever they can work .	1
these are really the ultimate disposable battery . at 10 times the capacity of a lead acid and nearly half the weight there is no reason to not replace all your nicad and lead acid batteries with these . I put a set in my headlamps and they usually last me a year or more . Much nicer then changing them nearly monthly	1
I read reviews , found the best type of battery , then found the best price on line at Amazon.com . I love when every thing comes to the front door .	1
THIS BATTERY GOT THE CONSUMER REPORTS RED DONUT FOR EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE , NO OTHER BATTERY DID , PERIOD . THEY TESTED 16 BRANDS .	1
These aa batteries are worth the price because these have such a better life span over alkiline batteries.I do n't have to replace the batteries as often and are probably as cheap in price as twice as many of the comparable alkiline batteries.I do highly recommend these batteries .	1
I bought these for my thermostat which uses these batteries . I wanted long life batteries since when replacing batteries on my thermostat erases the temperature programming , which is a laborious process . These are the very best you can buy . A good buy . Item arrived at least one month late , but in good condition	1
I have used these before . This 8-pak is priced better than a 4-pak at W-Mart . These batteries are great for digital cameras , they go much longer than regular alkalines .	1
I have a Microsoft mouse that insists upon the batteries being at top voltage . These AA Lithium batteries are the only ones that will run for a long length of time . Rechargeable only work about two weeks . Alkaline batteries work about six weeks . And these lithium batteries will work for many months . Once the rechargeable batteries or alkaline batteries drop even slightly in voltage , my mouse begins to perform poorly . These lithium batteries seem to hold peak voltage almost to the end of life .	1
Best battery you can get for all those battery eating devices -- remote controls . wireless mice and keyboards , LED desk lamps and flashlights .	1
Use AA and AAA lithium batteries in everything around the house . They last so much longer than regular alkaline . Alkaline lose power just sitting , while lithium not so much . Like this brand .	1
I 've used a couple of these in my older ePulse that usually uses up recharegeable batteries in a day , or Alkalines in a few days . These batteries have been used every day for short measurements of pulse rate for over 2 months now .	1
When energizer brought the lithium chemistry to a 1.5v ( in reality 1.7v ) AA battery they gave the consumer a choice . I purchased these for a specific application , allow me to explain.Earlier I had purchased the honeywell weather station ( wireless ) which relies on AA batteries - I think I used 28 doing the install . Some locations were a royal pain to get to and I did not want to try and change 4 batteries with 8 tiny screws on my roof very often.Enter the L91BP . Batteries have a price . There is the cost of acquisition here on amazon , disposal , and the time spent replacing them . Let 's say you estimate your time at $ 40/hr which is reasonable for any engineer.Assuming a good grade alkaline is $ 1/cell and these are $ 2/cell to change 4 batteries I am spending an extra $ 4 . If they last 7 times longer , I 've avoided 6 trips up on the roof to change them . If it takes me 1 hour to remove and re-install the batteries , then clearly at $ 40/hr I have come out ahead buying the more expensive cells , since I saved 6 changes , or $ 240 worth of my time.I also put a second temp meter in my deep freeze and set an alarm on it on the receiver . Because alkaline cells dont perform in sub-0 temps , I used the L91-BPs again for that application.Now the products that are easy to change the battery in did not get the lithium cells , however they may if removing the 8 tiny screws without loss becomes a pain.Cons : Because of their 1.7V output , some flashlights may be overvoltaged with 4 of these in series and caution not to use lithium AA cells .	1
These work great in my new Nikon L12 . I have the rechargeabels , but they would be drained down so quickly in this camera , that it became a pain in the neck all the time . These new lithium are little pricey , but they make taking digital photos a lot easier .	1
OK they are expensive batteries . I purchased them for a digital camera . They provide power for an extraordinary number of photos.I used two of them in my remote mouse . It was overkill but the mouse is still going big time.The batteries were sold and shipped by Technulty.. They substituted 2 4 packs for the 8 pack . No problem with that . They arrived promptly .	1
I have used these Batteries before , and they last a very long time . And have plenty of power , so the battery goes a long way . One thing I like about lithium batteries is , you can use them out in the cold weather , and they never freeze . They have plenty of power , AND LAST A VERY LONG , LONG , TIME . I Highly Recommend the Lithium Batteries . Jim in Ohio .	1
These batteries are light-weight and work well . This is the easiest way to buy them . Good price and no shopping around .	1
Reviews say these batteries do last longer , and they are worth the higher price . I did a lot of videos before I drained the batteries . I did n't keep track , but I believe they did last a lot longer , and this is what I will use in my camera , hence forth and forever after .	1
I am sold on Lithium batterys . For the money they are the best value for your buck . Sure they are a little more expensive but in the long run they last so much longer .	1
What can you say about batteries ? They work as expected and the packaging was a bit easier to open , although improvements could still be done to make it easier to get out the first battery without destroying the package .	1
These batteries according to reviews on other sights are the longest lasting ones you can buy . So far so good . Great selling and they are what I ordered . I find that many items are less expensive on Amazon .	1
Bought these for some trail cameras taking videos , with sound , field scan etc . Are holding up well ( better than new Alkaline ) and the price was great . They also have a listed Shelf Life of 15 years , and are supposed to last 9 times longer than Alkaline batteries with high drain applications . I recommend the product and the seller Brooklyn Battery Works . Purchased some more of these from Mel Pierce Camera ( an actual store but on Amazon too ) at a cheaper price and they were delivered fast . Reason I mentioned the sellers is due to what appears to be some scammers selling them . Both these sellers are fine , fast , priced fair , new in the package .	1
These are the 6x lithium ion batteries , not the 9x ones.The unit price is much better than I see in stores and these batteries really last a long time . I use them in my green laser pointer because they last so much longer than regular alkaline batteries . The higher price is more than offset by the long life . Buying them on Amazon makes them an even better deal .	1
Lithium batteries are suppose to be the # 1 battery to use , thats if you want to have long lasting.I have not yet used them . I am ordering for some but my question is.Does anyone know if these would be good to use in my son Xbox controller for his game ? Please , if anyone could answer this , I would appreciate it . Thank you	1
We read about using lithium batteries in a digital camera . We bought these for a cruise we just took . We took over 500 pictures and some video with our camera . We are still using the first two batteries ! Worth the extra cost for the amount of life you get and we do n't have to pack and take the recharger !	1
I did n't notice 9 times longer useage but then again I was n't measuring real close . I did n't think it was worth the extra money but , that should n't be the definitive answer for anyone ! : - )	1
They are used in an Acurite weather station that we purchased . The weather station has an outdoor sender that it mounted on our patio . During the coldest parts of the year , the temperature on the patio can be in the teens . Acurite , in the manual that comes with the weather station , recommends that lithium batteries be used in the outdoor sensor.As recommended by Acurite , we used the lithium batteries in the outdoor sensor . We purchased these batteries about a year ago . So far , the batteries have performed flawlessly . We have n't yet had to replace the batteries in the sensor so I ca n't comment on their life , except to say that it 's at least a year , at least for our type of use .	1
I know you probably think it is wasteful to use these in a Mouse , but my Logitech mouse was going through AA alkalines every 2 weeks . Switched to these and the mouse has been running for over one year !	1
This is the only way to go for my wildlife camera , which sits in single-digit weather for hours , covered with ice .	1
There are a lot of people that need more of a charge with electronics that only alkaline batteries can not do , especially today 's standard of electronics . Energizer has made that accomplishment with their Ultimate Lithium batteries . They work absolutely well in my hi-tech chargers for my Iphone and Ipod Touch , without the hassle of charging it to my computer all the time . They are simple to use and work great . I was pleasantly surprised at how good they can run , but when I tried them in my instant Energizer Charger , I was convinced that they were excellent at the power they have given me into my player . If you have a smartphone or a camera that needs more than alkaline batteries , I definitely recommend you give these a try from Energizer.Price : BCharging : B+Overall : B 1/2+	1
Despite the price these are great for anything you need to rely on and/or can not easily access to change the batteries	1
I needed some extra strong AA batteries to keep the quantum gate open between this world and the world I normally rule in , called Nibiru . OK , really I needed some extra strong batteries to work in my portable dental sonic pick - and these perform very well . The price on Amazon was very good and mine arrived in an 8-pack as described in the description , so I am a happy purchaser of this product .	1
For almost everything in my household I use Sanyo eneloop rechargeable batteries , and could not be more pleased with them . However , I recently purchase several LED emergency road flares , and wanted batteries which I would n't need to check frequently . While the eneloops are also good for long term storage in the cold , they discharge faster when it is hot , and do n't perform as well in the cold as these lithium batteries , which are rated down to -40F . If you need these for more heavily used devices , you might want to get rechargeables , but these store well and operate in a wide range of temperatures .	1
They cost more then regular batteries but worth the price . I only use these in more important stuff and or hard or a pain to change items .	1
No other battery works better in mySteriPENwater purifier , AA-cell powered digital cameras , high-intensity search lights , and sound-amplifier . In each of these high-drain applications , the Energizer L91 Lithium AA cells genuinely last 3 ~ 5 times longer than premium alkaline AAs - especially in cold weather . They seem to have good shelf lives , which is nice for some of my remote campsite caches . They regularly outperform all but the most expensive NiMH rechargeable . While 14500 cells yield even better results in high-drain applications , they are n't as commonly supported in electronics equipment ( only two of my flashlights give me the option for AA or 14500 cells ) . CR123A , 186500 and other specialty cells also outperform , but I appreciate the ubiquity of the AA form factor . When I 'm deep in rural parts of the country , I 'm more likely to find alkaline AAs , than CR123As , in a pinch . As such , a lot of my gear relies on top quality alkaline , low self-discharge NiMH rechargeable , and these Energizer Lithium cells .	1
Great brand at a great price that always delivers superior service . Love them for things such as remote controls , cordless mouse , cordless keyboard and such . Very long lasting	1
I primarily use these batteries in myNikon SB-600 Speedlight Flash . I started using them about a year ago after much frustration with the lifespan of normal alkaline batteries . I am not a professional photographer but it is a pretty serious hobby ( addiction my wife would say ) of mine , and nothing drives me more crazy than my equipment becoming the limiting factor of what I want to do creatively . Replacing batteries in the flash on what seems like a weekly basis is annoying -- running out of juice in my camera flash at the wrong moment is much worse and can even be devastating depending on the context.Thankfully these excellent lithium batteries from Energizer are truly superior in performance over either normal alkaline or rechargeable batteries . I get 500-700 shots out of a set of these , which makes them economical compared with the seemingly less expensive alternatives.It is possible to find these batteries in larger packs at big box stores , but they 're actually the same price per battery overall . I prefer them shipped free to my door , even if they were slightly more expensive.These are great batteries for virtually any photography application weather in a point-and-shoot digital or in a flash unit like the SB-600 . As other reviewers have mentioned , they are not superior when used in low drain applications like a computer mouse . Stick with normal alkaline or nimh batteries for those uses .	1
The Energizer L92 Lithium AAA cell is a fantastic power source . For high-drain applications , it offers great advantages over ordinary alkaline cell and rechargeable NiMH cell . However , it is also very expensive as a disposable battery . So it is important to recognize the strength of L92 , and use it only in applications that give you the best results . Otherwise you 'll be wasting your money.According to data sheet published by Energizer , the capacity of this Lithium AAA cell ( L92 ) is 1200mAh . This number remains nearly constant with load current . In comparison , the ordinary Alkaline battery ( such as the Energizer E92 ) is also rated as 1200mAh , but only at a very light load of 25mA . At a heavy load of 500mA ( typical for a P & S ; digital camera ) , its capacity is reduced to about one-third . The difference gets even greater at low temperature . At zero degree C and 500mA load , the L92 can provide about seven times more energy compared to the E92 . This is where the marketing claim of `` Last up to 7 times longer '' comes from.When used in a digital camera at room temperature of 25 degree C , the L92 is more likely to last 3-4 times longer than alkaline . This is enough to justify its price , which is also around 3-4 times higher than alkaline . However , in low-drain applications ( such as smoke detector , wireless mouse or remote control ) alkaline cells will last just as long at a fraction of the cost.The L92 also contains much higher energy when compared to rechargeable NiMH cell such as theSanyo Eneloop AAA . This is partially due to its higher terminal voltage of 1.5V , which is 20 % higher than that for NiMH.Energy stored in eneloop AAA : 0.8Ah * 1.25V = 1.0Wh , Energy stored in L92 : 1.2Ah * 1.5V = 1.8Wh ( 80 % higher ) .Higher terminal voltage for L92 is especially advantageous in digital camera applications , because your camera flash will recharge up to 20 % faster . On the other hand , it may create problems with some applications such as unregulated LED flash light . Higher than expected voltage will make the lamp burn brighter , but the excessive heat may also cause the lamp to burn out quickly.Bottom line : If you need AAA batteries for a long hiking trip or for emergency standby , then L92 is obviously your best choice . For most other situations , I recommend using low self-discharge NiMH cells for lower operating cost .	1
I go through these batteries every 6 months and these work well under very demanding use running a motor . All tested well and arrived quickly . Packaged as shown . The price is very reasonable	1
I have used the Lithium battery for around two years now in my camera , remotes , flashlights , etc ... . I 've found them to be of great quality and superior to even the legendary & # 34 ; Copper Top & # 34 ; . This time Amazon has as good a price as I can find locally and having Amazon Prime made the difference in my purchase ! You do not go through very many of these . Seem to hold on to their power well !	1
These batteries work great in my digital camera . They have a long shelf life and hold up many times longer than alkaline batteries .	1
I was so tired of having to replace the batteries for my remotes , I decided to give these a try and I 'm glad I did .	1
These Lithium batteries are so much lighter . These have help up to longer run times on my high drain devices . I knocked a star of for packaging . They come in a non-standard clear container not meant for these batteries that will make you think they are used . I have a battery tester and they all tested 100 % , so I am ok with the purchase , others may think they are used batteries .	1
Not everyone needs lithium batteries . But my backyard weather station recommended lithium for extreme hot or cold climates . These batteries arrived fresh and in the original card ( just like the picture ) . This price on Amazon is very good , and delivery is straight to my door .	1
Energizer lithium batteries are money . They cost a lot , but they 're definitely worth it . I use them in an led headlamp and it 's noticeably brighter .	1
How do you rate a battery that lasts 9 times longer when you have only had it for a couple of months . They work and hopefull will continue for a number of months to come . It 's worth a try so as not to have to replace them very often .	1
I 've used these batteries in applications that go through a lot of batteries : a camera with a battery-draining display , and some speakers with no AC connection . In the camera one set of batteries lasted through 656 pictures including 8 videos approximately 8 minutes in length each . The speakers were used approximately 6 hours a day for 14 days and are still going strong .	1
I 've just ordered a second supply of these batteries . The first set I used in a pair of salt and pepper grinders . The first thing I noticed is that they seemed to be more powerful than the Duracell batteries I was using before . They are still running strong after three month 's of constant use . I would highly recommend Energizer Ultimate Lithimum batteries to anyone looking for the best , longest lasting battery . I am thouroughly satisfied with them.UPDATE : It 's now been over four months and they are still going strong . I 've purchased another pack of 8 just to keep them on hand when I need them . They have a 15 year shelf life so I 'm not worried about them going bad over time .	1
These batteries last very long are very lightweight and very powerful . You spend more but you get more out of them .	1
I use these in a portable water pic which is essential for my current denatal situation . I travel alot to remote areas and they hold up for a long time . I recommend them .	1
The power contained in these batts is amazing . They seem to last forever and forever and ... ... ... ... ... You get the picture .	1
I use these in my Canon DSLR flash attachment to get consistent , fast-recycling that simply ca n't compare to rechargeables or even standard alkalines . They last a long time , retain power even when they 're just sitting not being used , and provide excellent power for photo equipment . These are worth the extra cost because they last way longer and maintain their high power throughout their life cycle . I 'll be continuing to use these for my camera equipment ( though I 'll use rechargeables for less critical devices like remote controls , Wii remotes , toys , etc . ) .	1
These batteries have a specific use : They are the navy seal or special ops of batteries . You do n't want to use them in your every day juicing of low drain applications . They are for the knock down drag out applications that other batteries can only handle for minutes . Camera flashes . Remote control cars . High drain applications where you need a battery that can go in and provide high power for a specific use.They 're expensive , they 're finely tuned to provide maximum output for maximum time on high drain activities . Do n't waste them on remote controls , mice or smoke detectors .	1
great price , and last a long time . Cheaper than in the stores , and when they are dead , I take them to be recycled .	1
There is a huge difference in lithium compared to regular batteries . Really useful if you store your electronics for extended periods of time because they do not leak . I am a believer and will put lithium 's in all my electronics .	1
These batteries work great . Last longer on the shelf , are much lighter in weight , and have more capacity . Great for your Camera Flash ! !	1
I bought these for a digital camera which went through alkalines every 30 photos . After researching how alkalines drop to about 1.2 volts after very little use and then level out from there I learned that these lithiums maintain the 1,5 volts for a much longer period of use and consequently allow my camera to continue to work through about 120 to 150 photos . I also use these in the outside unit of my weather station because they will not fail at subzero temperatures like alkalines do . The added cost is worth it in some instances but probably not for general use .	1
Tried these on my Lacrosse Technology weather center in which they require a minimum voltage . These batteries meet minimum requirement and more ... ...	1
The Energizer Lithium AA battery 8-packs are great value . I discovered these batteries as they came with my Apple wireless keyboard and mouse . I was incredibly impressed by the longevity of those particular wireless devices , when powered by these lithium batteries . I went several months without thinking about batteries in them . By comparison , afterwards , I used traditional alkaline AAs and the same devices lasted only a few short weeks.Now I am again enjoying the benefits of these lithium batteries . This 8-pack sold on Amazon is a particularly great value . At first I thought the lithium batteries were too expensive , when I saw a 2-pack in a store , for nearly ten dollars . With this package on Amazon , the batteries usually cost around two dollars each . A great value and not much more than alkaline batteries , for a lot longer lasting power ! Lithium batteries also work better in extreme temperatures . If you , for example , have an outside thermostat for a weather station , this will work in the winter , whereas an alkaline battery may not.An interesting tip , when my higher power devices , like bluetooth keyboard , runs low on power . I go ahead and pop one of the used lithium batteries into a clock . I 'm not sure how long it will last , but it 's a great way to recycle at least a few of your almost drained lithium batteries.Now I 've started using these , new , in powered toothbrushes , and I find it 's a lot more powerful and longer lasting.I highly recommended these for devices that quickly drain regular alkaline varieties .	1
I have used this product for years and know how reliable they are and I would never hesitate to buy this product ! !	1
We purchased an indoor/outdoor thermometer . The manual stated that it would be a good idea to use lithium batteries when the temperature outside dipped around freezing . It is a probe outside is wireless and I will change the batteries today to lithium . Lithium batteries have a longer lifespan than alkaline batteries and Amazon 's price was fair .	1
arrived quickly from amazon , use it in my high tech led flashlights , i used to use the rechargeable ones to save money and recycle but they leak sometimes and do not last at all.. decided its more effective to use these lithiums , i own a few 4sevens , and fenix flashlights and they work the best with these .	1
got 'em quick with no problems . yes they absolutely last longer [ I use them in a lable maker ] . These are great batteries but are not for every app . I do not recommend using the 9v version in a smoke detector . The lithium bateries by nature go until they are completely exausted then suddenly they are completely spent wih no warning . The alkilne batteries slowly get weaker thus letting the detector let out those annoying squeeks which tell you the detector 's batteries need changing . Not to keen of a flashlite blinking out with no warning . But , the tremendious shelf life and longer runs between changes is a real plus.PS Check to see that you are getting the correct ones for your needs . They have different life spands of lasting 4,5,8 and the ultimate of 9 times longer than alkiline batts .	1
I have bought several packs of these through amazon with no issues . These batteries are fantastic and I ca n't recommend them enough over crappy alkaleaks !	1
I bought these batteries specifically to go in the outdoor portion of my indoor-outdoor weather monitoring station . I tried normal alkaline batteries first , but they do not provide enough voltage when the temperature is low . Then I tried NiMH rechargeables , but those crap out at an even higher temperature . Then I coughed up the extra money for lithium , i.e . these batteries.These batteries are the only ones that work when it is very cold outside . Lithium wins ! These are approximately the cheapest lithium batteries on Amazon , that is how I chose them . And they are a name brand . Go figure .	1
What can you say about these Energizers ? We expect and get perfection from the product which does n't disappoint . Good batteries .	1
I like the long shelf life of these batteries , combined with their extended service life in my digital cameras . Because they last longer , I have the convenience of carrying fewer batteries on photo outings and trips .	1
works great	1
I mainly use these battery 's in remote sensors where they far out perform alkaline battery 's . I first got a lesson on their advantage was with a golf logix GPS . Alkaline lasted 2 rounds of golf where the lithium can last around 6-7 rounds . The only downside is when they are done , it 's all over . They do n't gradually go down like normal batteries .	1
I love using these batteries . Very powerful and like lithiums provide full voltage and power til the very end - not like alkaline that gradually loose power and voltage over time.A super battery and reliable .	1
I 'm enjoying this brush ! The handle is easy to hold and it reaches in places that are hard to get to .	1
Feels strange to be reviewing a brush I use to scrub my tub . Brush is a tad bit smaller than I would like , but certainly gets the job done . Well built and I get the impression it will last for quite some time . Overall a good choice for the price	1
to hold and is an effective scrub brush . Another item requested by Occupy Sandy for the clean-up . I have one of these myself !	1
I ordered this scrub brush with the intent of using it on sinks and showers . I first used it when I threw my microfiber couch cushions in the laundry and they came out stiff . I used this brush to easily bring back the softness that microfiber is known for.Since then I have used it for sinks , tile , shower , and linoleum . It has worked fabulously each and every time and it is now my go to scrub brush . It is extremely comfortable in my hand , they did a fantastic job with the ergonomics . It is easy to apply gentle or firm pressure based on the situation.If you need a versatile brush that works well and is comfortable in your hand , this is it .	1
Excellent for the bathtub when scrubbing the ring around the tub . Easy to grip , easy to use . I think you will like this brush . It does what you expect it to do .	1
This brush has very stiff bristles that can clean very well , but they also bend just enough to scrub away without doing damage . I use it all over my bathroom and it works like a charm	1
I 've never owned a scrub brush that was this size . I mean for a small hand it is PERFECT . I just cleaned the bathtub yesterday and I was able to get to hard-to-clean corners because of it 's size . Bristles are strong . Handle has a good feel . This brush puts all other brushes to shame . I will NEVER buy another brand again .	1
Superb bristles , a great handle , this is a really well done product . Useful for tubs , floors , sinks , whatever . Very much recommended .	1
I like the grip and the way the brush part hold up . Hard to excited about a brush but I am most happy with the results .	1
Brushes are very sturdy and great deal ! Ordering more for other uses such as carpet in the cars and tires !	1
Heavy duty and a miracle worker on dirty carpets ! I love this scrubber . It has an easy handle that can handle any carpet job .	1
I bought this a couple weeks ago to use to scrub up some stains out of our carpet and it has worked wonderfully . And while the bristles are delicate enough to not destroy a carpet , they are also robust enough to use to scrub a shower , sink or tub - I 've used it for all of these . This is a bit more expensive than other bargain scrub brushes you might find , but the ergonomic grip really is worth it . If you are going to be using this for any extended period of time , your hands and wrist will feel the difference .	1
I 've used this scrub on many occasions to clean grimes and scums on my bathroom tiles . I highly prefer this OXO product over similar items you 'd find in supermarket 's cleaning aisle section . The handle is comfortable and the bristles are stiff . It has good ergonomic design and makes a tedious job bearable . Highly recommended .	1
I have always kept a hefty scrub brush around for I have an old kitty that loves to toss up her dinner occasionally , plus a young puppy that often feels left out and follows suit . Scrub brushes are easy to find and probably never considered here much on Amazon . But trust me when I tell you that not only is this a terrific brush , but it is also very hard to find in stores . The power behind this baby is its contoured plum like handle that sits directly on top . It gives you maximum comfort for your hand while directing the brushes where you want without you getting tired and the brushes just slipping lightly over the stain . The handle and the brushes are of a great quality and and I bought two for different parts of the house . Definitely a vast improvement over the usual handles we all are used to seeing on brushes like this , and at a very fair price here on Amazon . The best , and highly recommended ...	1
Seller was efficient and product is excellent , seems like industrial strength ... not one of the kitchen brushes I bought in the past from the local Target that wore out quickly .	1
This scrub brush is so comfortable to hold and does a great job getting things clean fast . I 've used it on the shower/tub , tile floor , carpet , sink - pretty much everywhere . I do n't enjoy cleaning , so might as well make it as comfortable , easy and fast as possible .	1
OXO makes very sturdy and well built items , this is no different . A great strong brush with a great grip for deep cleaning .	1
Heavy duty , I have bought scrub brushes before for floor spills and none have worked like this.. Tough and great for every day use if you need it	1
I just LOVE this brush . Not only does it & # 34 ; feel good & # 34 ; to the hand , but it 's design allows you to easily get into the rounded corners of the bathtub whereas a flat , rectangular shaped brush made rounded areas difficult to clean . The non-slip rubber grip is a plus as well . I 'm really happy with this purchase . Will buy again when I need a replacement . Have been using it for over 10 months and it shows no signs of wear . Very satisfied .	1
I had one of this brush already , but wanted another for outside . I use my inside one to clean tubs and shower tile mainly , and anything else that needs the work of its sturdy bristles . I use the outside one for dirty or mucky shoes , and to clean out our two flat , rectangular bird feeders that hang outside in the weather . If it rains or snows , the feeders get pretty nasty inside on the bottom , but we like them as they allow the birds , squirrels and chipmunks to all be able get into the trays to eat .	1
OXO has made another great scrub brush here with this one for me ! I love the ergonomical handle that seems to reduce the fatigue that I would often experience when scrubbing with many of my other scrub brushes , especially in the shower - and it protects your knuckles from the banging that often happens with other brushes as well.I really appreciate the fact that this brush has bristles that are stiff enough to clean and scrub the tiles and grout in the bathroom to get them to a nice sparkle , yet soft enough to feel comfortable to use this on my bathroom vanity countertops without fear of scratching . This brush is the perfect size for so many chores both in and out of the house - in the bathroom , the kitchen , the garage , cleaning tile floors , scrubbing outside windows , etc ... This even works excellent for use when washing the cars at home to make the tires on the cars ( the black rubber part ) come so clean that they look brand new again ; spray on a little Armor-All after and they are showroom ready !	1
Scrubs scrubs and scrubs ! Perfect for all those hard to reach places and perfect in the hand of all cleaners !	1
This bottle brush is great . We bought it for washing things like water bottles and glasses . It might be hard to see in the picture but the blue part of the brush sticks out a little and it more flat to help get all the corners of whatever you 're cleaning . Also the grippy part is easy to hold on to and the neck of the brush is long enough for everything I 've used it on . I 'm always happy with OXO products and this one is no exception.I highly recommend this .	1
No kitchen should be without one of these . This has replaced my two other dish and bottle scrubbers . I now use this when washing dishes almost exclusively since it gets down into glasses and cleans the inside of them very easily . I pop it into the dishwasher when I run it . It is flexible enough to get into anything but still sturdy enough to get the job done fast and easy . Works well on dishes too so it 's not just strictly for bottles but for anything in the kitchen . Nice long handle also . I wish I had found this years ago .	1
Mine arrived flattened on 2 sides from packaging , but after it got wet it sprang back to its normal shape . It works fine . It went in my narrow-mouth water bottles even though it did n't look like it would . It went in wet but not when it was dry . The opening on my bottle is barely over 1 '' ( about 1 1/16 '' ) Base Brands 16-Ounce Reduce WaterWeek Bottle , Set of 5	1
I have used this brush for years for cleaning my Vitamix Super 5000 Blender Container Blades . The bristles are flexible yet strong enough to withstand repeated assault from the very sharp stainless steel Vitamix Blades . Not a single bristle has been cut by the blades and those blades are really sharp . It works great for glass tumblers and smoothies cups too . It is durable and everlasting .	1
the other brushes we 've tried were too hard and did n't offer enough flex to really clean . These bristles are perfect and get our bottles and sippy cups much cleaner .	1
i have tried many brands and types of bottle brush and now i finally found the one.this brush is just enough soft and flexible to clean bottles well . The bristles are soft and yet sturdy to withstand pressure . Unlike rubber/silicone based brush whose bristles have no strength to stand straight , this will easily clean corner without having to jam the brush into the corner.Another good feature is the lenght , it is around a foot long , so you can use it to clean your vacuum flask/thermos easily as well .	1
I have stopped buying cheap brushes , they do n't do the job and I have to buy them often . The OXO brushes do what I ask and last a very long time . Will continue to invest in good cleaning supplies bc I will be cleaning till I die	1
Not only does it clean the stainless steel bottles I just purchased , but it is a great addition to my sink . I 've been using it to wash glasses , scrub plates , etc . I love the way it flexes into the grooves and the fit in my hand . Highly recommend .	1
Just what I expected , great product that is really nice on the hand and easy to use . This thing shourld	1
It is surprisingly hard to find a brush like this . I just wanted it to be able to clean my travel mugs really well . I do n't like putting them in the dishwasher and a sponge does not reach everywhere . This is a great brush for a good price . I have been using it for about a year and it still looks great , the bristles do not wear easily so I think it will last for a long time . I am now able to reach all those touch spots in my travel mugs , carafes , and vases .	1
We bought this brush initially to clean baby bottles , but it fast became our go to brush for cleaning anything tall & round ( water bottles , travel coffee mugs , glasses , vases ) . Bristles are soft so they wo n't scratch or damage anything , but powerful enough to also get things clean . We love the flexible neck too as we can clean things that are slightly curved and this brush does n't get stuck in anything ! Love it !	1
I like this brush better than another one I had that was just too stiff to really do a good job getting into corners . This one gets into corners just fine . It does seem to pick up stains easily . I run it through the dishwasher to help keep it clean .	1
I bought this along with OXOs travel coffee mug . Cleans out mug well as well as other dishes . All the bristles are soft so if you want a hard scrubber pass on this .	1
Very sleek look and great grip on this bottle brush . Simple , yet effective , does n't have that cheap look or performance that some do . All-in-all ; great brush !	1
I bought this brush to wash glass bottles we bought at the same time and I 'm so glad I did ! Aquasana AQ-6005 18-Ounce Glass Water Bottles , 6-Pack	1
I use this brush every day to clean my Vita-Mix after making my morning protein shake . I have large hands that do n't fit inside normal size glasses so I use it for all things tall and slim .	1
When you have bottles and you juice a lot , you need bottle cleaners . This brush is much better than the previous ones I have owned . This gets down inside and is sturdy yet flexible enough to bend within the bottle to clean those hard to get to places.Love it .	1
I use this brush everyday . I use it to clean out thermos , the coffee pot , canning jars anything that needs cleaning . Wish I had purchased a second . One day I will get on here and remember to buy myself a couple of spares .	1
I bought this to clean my nalgene Titan bottle 1000ml . It 's perfect . Must have for anyone with a reusable bottle .	1
This brush is the perfect size for cleaning our Contigo Coffee mugs ( not the lid just the mug ) . It holds soap surprisingly well and has proven durable over the last few months . The handle has a nice rubber feel and the brush is flexible .	1
I have always struggled cleaning my tea pot and my Nalgene water bottles . I would stuff washcloths into them and spin them around but I never felt like I was doing a good job . I saw this cheap little brush on amazon and figured I 'd give it a go . This brush helps me all the time now . It can squeeze into the holes my hand ca n't fit in and I can move it around and scrub the insides . I am impressed with this brush and am very glad I found it .	1
Decent brush for price , but Walmart has a better brush for less money . It 's up to you . If Walmart is close , get it there , if not , then amazon . Decently manufactured . Hey . It 's a brush .	1
After trying anther more expensive bottle brush that had a weak handle that made it hard to clean with , I was very pleased to find this one does not have that problem . It is about a foot long , with a nice rubber grip and a very strong handle and quality construction , Soft bristles that clean well . Overall very good and a great value .	1
This brush fits into bottles very easily , and does a really good job for things that are not dried on , it 's not quite as effective for gunkier/dried on things , but filling the bottle with water and letting it soak first helps .	1
Works well but I wish it 's bristles were a touch harder and there were more of them . But it does work pretty well anyway .	1
The handle is thin enough to get into & # 34 ; Sport Cap & # 34 ; style water bottles . The bristles are soft , so they will not scratch plastic or steel -- meaning no where for bacteria to grow or smells to move in.Be advised : Do n't let this dry on it 's side . The Bristles are so soft that they 'll become permanantly smooshed .	1
I usually avoid OXO products , not always but when I can . They 're too rubbery for me . This works fine though . My wife makes our peanut butter and the empty jars are hard to clean out to reuse . This makes it very easy .	1
For the price I paid , this is an excellent item to have in the kitchen . But the quality of Oxo 's Buttle Brush is excellent . Good job Oxo	1
I really love this water brush . We drink all of our water out of glass bottles in an effort to get away from petro chemicals leaching out of plastic water bottles . This brush does a great job of making the job of washing all of these bottles very easy .	1
I bought this brush to clean out the back of my coffee maker as well as my soda stream bottles . It does the trick - collapses down to get into corners and into the bottles and then fans right back out . Certainly does the trick . I just keep it in my dishwasher and pull it out when I 'm cleaning those hard to clean items .	1
This bottle brush has a flexible handle and even fits into bottles with very small spouts ( 1 '' or 1.5 '' , I 'm not sure ) . I use this to clean out my bottles weekly and am very happy with this purchase . I chose to purchase this specific bottle brush because it is so highly-reviewed . I bought this to replace a former bottle-brush , whose bristles were attached to the stem with wire ( so they got bent out of shape ) . I really prefer this one , it cleans so well , stays clean , and seems indestructible !	1
I now use it to wash cups , bottle , all sorts of containers as well.Great flexible brush .	1
we originally purchased a bottle brush at Wal Mart , but they only carried brushes for cleaning baby bottles . This turned out to be completely useless , so I purchased the OXO brush from Amazon . It is a well made product that is long enough to clean inside my half-gallon glass milk containers . Another useful kitchen tool to make life easier .	1
The brush is good quality & does fine for glasses & baby bottles . I , unfortunately , bought it to use to clean swing top bottles that I use for kifir soda . It will not fit through the opening . I decided on this one after another reviewer said that they used it to clean beer bottles . Their bottles must have larger openings than mine .	1
I use this for everything -- bottles and glasses & coffee cups and mugs also . Milk that has dried in bottom on glass or coffee rings in cups and mugs . Use this brush to swish that stuff out before loading in dishwasher .	1
I put tea in my metal water bottles and the residue builds up rapidly . Just rinsing doesn & # 8217 ; t help and I decided I & # 8217 ; d purchase the OXO bottle brush . With a quick whirl around the inside of the bottle , it swiped that tea residue out in a second . I was very pleased and tried it on several other things that needed a bit of cleaning . I simply left the brush to soak after I was done and it still looks like new.FEATURES : & # 9658 ; Durable neck flexes for easy reach inside bottles , pitchers and carafes & # 9658 ; Ideal for sauce jars , baby bottles , vases and tall glasses & # 9658 ; Stiffer bristles clean hard-to-reach corners & # 9658 ; Safe for crystal and stemware & # 9658 ; Tackles multiple tasks with two types of bristles & # 9658 ; Flexible neck makes getting into hard spots easy & # 9658 ; Rounded head is perfect fit for bottles and narrow jars & # 9658 ; Nonslip handle , wet or dry & # 9658 ; Perfect for gentle cleaning or vigorous scrubbing & # 9658 ; Dishwasher safeI even tried using it in the dish drainer for those hard to reach corners that always seem to have a little grimy buildup . Worked like a charm , but it did soil the brush a bit . I simply put a bit of bleach in some sudsy water and it immediately came clean . Then I rinsed it well and dried it . I was expecting a stiff brush , but instead got one that was soft , but just stiff enough to do those tricky jobs . Really pleased with this purchase .	1
It 's hard to find a good bottle brush and a good price , and this is it . It fits into narrow bottles and the bristles are soft enough not to scratch .	1
This has softer bristles that wo n't scratch your glassware . I have had it for quite awhile , and the bristles are still in good condition - no bending or flattening . Only complaint which cost a star is that the bristles have discolored ( probably from my berry smoothies ) , and I can not get them white again even with a bleach-containing cleaner .	1
This is wonderful to use to clean all of my glasses and bottles . Works great ! Made very well . Good quality .	1
What more can one say ? Every OXO I have purchased has been great and this is no exception . Good little bottle washer	1
I use this to clean out all sorts of cups and bottles and it always maintains its shape . Been using it for almost a year now and its still going strong . Its really only for light cleaning though because the brush bristles are too soft to do much scrubbing , but they are the right softness to easily squish into a small bottle opening , which is what I bought it for . I 'd buy it again with the knowledge that its just a light duty brush specifically for water bottles/jugs .	1
A good bottle brush is a necessity for cleaning those reusable glass bottles that I carry daily for water or juice , etc . This is a good brush made by OXO . The handle is comfortable and the perfect length for getting to the bottom of a large bottle or thermos .	1
I love this thing for cleaning my bicycle water bottles , and it 's soft enough to do wine glasses , narrow cups , etc . too . I 've purchased additional brushes as gifts for my biking friends . I 'm still sing the original one I bought -- seems pretty durable . The handle is long enough to reach into the larger water bottles ( 20 oz . I think ) , so that 's a plus .	1
The bottom bristles while a little stiffer than the side ones , but still overall pretty soft . I would say this is fine for gentle cleaning like it is described , but I do not get where they get vigorous cleaning from with such soft bristles . The handle length seems adequate , and the actual handle is indeed comfortable to grip and has a non-slip surfaceIt will do for light jobs and has its place , but the softness of the bristles limits what I would call vigorous scrubbing .	1
I 've had this brush for a while and it 's still in good shape . I love it for swishing out glasses . The bristles are a bit soft and flick water around if you 're not careful but the long somewhat flexible handle is great .	1
We have had a couple really nice bottle brushes that have recently just given up completely and we needed replacements fast . We looked at all the stores we regularly haunt , but did not find anything of a satisfactory type and quality . So online I went and found this great sounding brush and decided to give it a tryout , so far it has performed flawlessly cleaning all sizes and shapes of bottles and containers of all types as well . Overall this has been a great purchase , and I hope they have these in the future for when this one gives up the ghost in a few years ...	1
Ca n't go wrong with oxo products and this is another good one . Handle is sturdy and the bristles are soft but clean well . I 've put in dishwasher and still works well .	1
This brush is the best especially to clean out small mouthed bottles of all kinds & pitchers . To me the best part of this brush is it 's flexibility to reach places that normal plain brushes ca n't reach like unreachable cracks , crevices & bends & curved glass . This thing rocks & I am very very happy that I purchased it & I will be telling a lot of people about it because it makes cleaning pitchers , water bottles , jars & any think a breeze to clean & I most definitely am extremely satisfied with this wonderful product & wonderful seller that packaged my product so well . Go get one you will be very happy that you did so .	1
Looks good , especially the exuberant looking bristles at the business end . I use this with Aqua Sana glass water bottles and it 's perfect . Gets every bit of the interior clean with soapy water . The handle is typically Oxo quality , it 's a work of art as well as a bottle brush . Think back to old , mean-spirited , lifeless bottle brushes you used . Now look at this . Oxo GETS IT . A good tool you feel positively about it worth the effort , you know ?	1
It has not started falling apart like so many of these brushes do . The handle is comfortable and has a good grip to it .	1
As far as bottle brushes go , this works like a charm . My old brush was getting too gross so it was time for a replacement . Of course , I checked my local store and found nothing worthwhile so I logged onto Amazon and found this brush . It 's so nice to know you can find whatever you need online and purchase it with `` one click '' ... lol !	1
Love it . Another wonderful OXO product . I have bought several of their products and so far , so good . The price is great , too .	1
This brush does exactly what it is supposed to do . Even My husband likes it ! Can there be a higher recommendation than that ?	1
This is a reasonably nice brush with a good handle . However we would like something similar with a longer handle . Why do they stop at 12-13 & # 34 ;	1
It is the right length and width for cleaning those hard to get at travlers mugs that are too thin for most of the scrubbers I had . This worked perfect . I also bought one for a friend who agrees it works great .	1
I love scrubbing classes and bottles and what ever you got that needs a long handle brush for some good quality scrubbing . The bristles are a little weak , they could be sturdier .	1
Works for me ! It was just what I wanted . I would order it again when I need one along with the sink brushes .	1
This brush works perfect to clean out my favorite glass bottles . Does exactly what it should for a good price .	1
This is a great bottle cleaner . It cleans well and works well with a varied size bottles ! Keep your bottles clean and bacteria free with this brush !	1
I really have no complaints about this bottle brush . It is only that I have discovered another brand of brush which I like better than the OXO brush .	1
I should n't have waited . These are essential for thoroughly cleaning out your Nalgenes and Kleen Kanteens . The Kleen Kanteens are tough without a solution like this . I just could n't get the tea and coffee stains out . I should have bought this sooner just like the other reviewers said . Oh well - have one now - I 'm pleased and highly recommend .	1
I saw some people in these reviews complaining that the brush is too short for their purposes -- I do n't know what they 're cleaning with this brush , but all the thermoses and bottles I 've used it on have cleaned out quite nicely and easily . The bristles are firm but pliable , and the handle is ( like all OXO products ) ergonomic and easy to hold onto .	1
It does the job , so I should n't complain . I just wish the bristles were a little bit stiffer to help really scrub the bottles and such . Overall I like it , but it 's not the end-all be-all of bottle brushes.And the reviews indicating that it is not for smaller openings ... that 's a load of garbage . It can basically fit into an inch opening ... not sure what on earth they were doing .	1
I am becoming an OXO Superfan simply because their products meet most of my kitchen needs fully . Of those OXO products I have , not one has failed and each has performed as advertised , but with more effectiveness than I expected based on their modest prices . I bought this brush mainly to accompany a 6-pack of 18 ounce glass water bottles that would be hard to reach without a bristle brush . In goes the OXO and out comes the unwanted material . Luckily , the contents have been nothing but water and nothing else that we know of . A simple and effective brush goes a long way around here and we highly recommend this one .	1
Great for reaching inside bottles that are typically impossible to scrub , and general cleaning for any dishes you may have .	1
Drinking coffee continuously every day eventually runs a mark on all thermos canisters that one may have or use . Quick to the chase , this was my issue with drinking coffee and having to clean the Thermos canister every now and then was usually a time consuming nightmare.It is quite difficult to clean these canisters usually because water splashing and detergent is n't enough on its own . Using my hands to clean dirty materials is normally always the way I go about to clean something in need of clearing out but doing so for incredibly small and hollow canisters is & # 34 ; impossible & # 34 ; to do with hands alone.My hands are way too big to come close to fitting inside the small canister tops and I did n't know what I could use to scrub that coffee build up found inside the canisters . Quick enough , I find this simple product on Amazon and place an order . In just 2 simple days ( Amazon Prime Membership ) , I have the OXO Bottle brush and wow ! It squeezes through the tightest hollow canisters and easily brushes up any buildup of stains or particles that may be sticking to the inside of the container.In combination with the Urnex Clearly Coffee Liquid Coffee Pot Cleaner item also on Amazon and this OXO Bottle brush , your cleaning duties for the remaining of a living and drinking coffee life are now simplified ! No more struggles with getting a perfect clean canister . Drink with satisfaction and ease of mind and purchase this brush ! Brush feels durable and has a nice array and structure of cleaning threads . Comes topped with a rubbish grip for the lower handle and operates with ease for any inexperienced user . I feel like with proper care , this shall last for a lifetime .	1
The most fascinating thing about this brush the the sturd but extremely & # 34 ; soft feel & # 34 ; bristles . And more surprisingly , I find my self using it for almost all dishwashing tasks -- except from anyithing calling for more than light & # 34 ; scrubbing & # 34 ; .	1
This is one of the brushes by my sink that I use the most . It works very well as intended and I found even some more uses for it . I may order a second one .	1
I use this brush to clean narrow-necked , glass bottles ; stainless-steel , sports water bottles ; glass carafes ; and 16-ounce , tall , water glasses that are too narrow for my hand to fit inside.This has a really nice rubber grip . The bristles are firm enough to clean well , but not so hard they are n't flexible.Highly recommended !	1
Great bottle brush for our household with three kids who all play sports . So we are constantly washing water bottles that come home from games and practices . This brush is perfect for cleaning these bottles . ( And I imagine it would work just as well for baby bottles . ) My only complaint is that the bristles compress or collapse over time , so I find I have to replace this brush about every 3 or 4 months . I always buy the same one again , but I wish it lasted a bit longer !	1
This was just what I needed . I was worried at first , because the bristles were n't very stiff , but they still did the job JUST perfectly . I do n't know why I went so long without a bottle brush !	1
I bought this to get the inside of wine glasses and other glasses clean . I was very happy to find that they just barely fit into my champagne flutes . good brush .	1
works fine for water bottles and mason jars . it 's softer than i prefer , but it still manages to clean what needs to be cleaned .	1
This brush is great for cleaning my Thermos - which often smells when I leave coffee in it for too long . However , this brush takes the smell away instantly . Plus , unlike many sponges , this brush does not ever get moldy or smelly . I have not tried it with other types of bottles and containers but I assume it works just as well !	1
I was sitting on the fence between getting this bottle brush an the other one that had two other attachments . I went way from that one because I read that it was almost two feet long . Too long . This brush is really good . Bristles are soft enough to bend to allow the brush to go through a smaller openings yet firm enough to get the corners . Good product .	1
This is a very solid bottle brush . The bristles are soft , and more importantly , are solidly attached . The brush I owned before kept shedding its bristles everywhere . The handle is solid too . No danger of falling off.This brush is JUST long enough for my 12-ish inch Nissan thermos . It 's a bit hard to clean the bottom because the thermos ' mouth opening is fairly small and the whole brush pretty much disappears inside . But , it works .	1
I use these to clean sippy cups on a daily basis and they are a great product . They work very well and I will continue to buy these .	1
This has become the best brush I 've ever had to clean everything I 've got in my kitchen ! It cleans in all corners .	1
This is a good quality brush . This brand is a very good budget Buy . Brush cleans well and holds its shape without the bristles becoming stubs with use . Good quality at a good value . Recommend .	1
I bought one at Bed Bath and Beyond YEARS ago and it just now went . But I use it actually to clean the walls of shower and shower doors so that nothing scratches it . yes it works great as a bottle brush as now my new one I use for dishes and the old one in the bathroom .	1
Really nice product , it reaches the bottom of long bottles and easy to clean . At this price it 's a steal ! .	1
This is a really good brush but I was surprised at how soft the bristles ended up being . So far it works great but I 'm wondering how it will hold up to tough grim . Brush arrived on time and packaged well . If you do n't mind softer bristles , I would recommend this item and seller .	1
OXO makes the best things . This is the right size to fit into smaller mouth bottles . The length is perfect as well .	1
I bought 2 more of this after my first brush . The first brush is still holding up after a few years use in kitchen . I will buy this again when I need more .	1
Softer bristles than expected , but seems to work well . It 's actually larger than I imagined , but works well . Would n't hesitate to recommend this product .	1
I received this last week . I bought it to clean jars and glasses . Does not feel flimsy , does a good job . The last two bottle cleaners I bought in the grocery store were of appalling quality . This is in a whole different class.. it works ! I expect to feel the same way next month.June 2012 : This little miracle lasted for more than a YEAR . I finally retired the first one two months ago and am now using the second one . Talk about value for money spent !	1
Bigger than a baby bottle brush but strangely more useful . This brush is not going to fit into a bottle that can be sealed with a cork . It is however great for Nalgene type water bottles , teapots , bread tubes , the medium size aluminum thermoses ( ? ) thermi ( ? ) . It reigned victorious in both its duel against the aging chef wizard thingy and an accidental spin ( handle first ) in the garbage disposal .	1
no need to smash your hand into a cup again.good quality like all OXO products.1 2 3 4	1
Good construction . Functions like any decent bottle brush should . Had it for a few weeks and it has n't fallen apart or anything .	1
Great product ! Cleans the 1-liter bottles for the Soda Stream machine nicely . Is well made , and I imagine will last some time . A great product !	1
I have many OXO products . They are all great quality and highly functional . This bottle brush is no exception . I recommend .	1
I love this bottle brush ! It 's long enough to get into our very tall 32-ounce bottles . It 's sturdy enough to move it around in the bottles to get them nice and clean . The way the bristles are situated also helps get the bottles clean . I 've used in glass vases and other narrow necked items and because it is so slim there are very few bottles it wo n't fit into . It has also lasted longer than several other bottle brushes we 've tried . Very pleased !	1
grip handle , bristles conform to varying shapes very easily , dishwasher safe . Ideal for baby bottles , tall glasses , vases , flexible neck	1
I am going to purchase one here from Amazon . We bought one a few years back at Bed Bath & Beyond ? but I ca n't remember . We love it.Every day we use this to wash out bottle/protein shakers , it works very well . The head of this fits into a variety of bottles well , such as re-used gatorade , iced tea , and milk bottles , baby bottles too . Not all bottle brushes fit into smaller openings well , and still able to clean the interior bottle surfaces . The shaft of it is flexible too.The bristles are just right - they are also somewhat soft , which is great . Many other bottle brushes I looked at have super stiff bristles and do n't clean out things well or work as well with dish soap . The foam/sponge type bottle brushes ( like for baby bottles ) fall apart and get gross pretty easily.Every now and then the bristles get too dirty , well then just fill up a cup of really hot water and dish soap and wash it a bit and rinse out.This is a great price here too .	1
Sometimes you just need something simple.This brush is perfect for cleaning many sorts of travel cups , thermoses , bottles , vases , and other various hand-wash dishes such as little spoons . Since I 've collected the spoons from around the world , I want to keep them in good shape . The OXO brush is much nicer on the spoons than the dishwasher , and the multiple angles of the bristles make it very easy to clean smaller items.I have also used the brush on hand-wash cups because it is so easy to use . The flexible stem and bunches of bristles means it almost cleans the dish itself ( with soap ) .That said , I use it as a secondary brush most of the time , once I 've scraped off any visible marks . Although the bristles are good , they are not real strong . I do n't think it would scrape off dried dough , for instance.Considering the price , it may be worth it to just stock my sink with several of the OXO brushes , one for every occasion.I have n't washed the brush in the dishwasher yet , I 'll let you know the results when I do .	1
I used a baby one before but it was not long enough . This one is long enough and firm enough to clean all of my sports bottles .	1
I bought this at the same time as buying a new cookie press and planned to only really use it for that . However , I have also been using it to clean my canning jars that do n't have a wide mouth and it works great for that . The bristles are soft and wo n't scratch whatever you are cleaning , and the brush head fits through very small openings for difficult to clean items .	1
It did n't fit the bottle I bought it for , but then that bottle broke a couple of days after anyway . I kept it because I have another glass water bottle and it is soft and flexible , yet strong enough to clean from protein shakes .	1
I needed something that would reach deeper than the baby bottle brushes for water bottles , mason jars , etc . Works great .	1
We are using this for baby bottle brush . The bristles are just perfect in stiffness . It is easy to use as it slides smoothly in and out of the bottle . From what I read from other reviews , this brush is also great on Nalgene water bottles . The handle is made of rubber and very comfortable . It is a little long compared to other brush bottles we tried before but that does n't pose a problem at all.Overall , it is a well made brush .	1
OXO is known for well designed products and this is no exception . Son and daughter in law used extensively during grandson 's first year .	1
Bought this to replace an existing ( different brand ) of bottle brush . I am pleased with it . It works well and cleans great . I recommend this item !	1
I use this every day to clean my coffee tumbler and coffee pot and it still looks brand new . The grip is high quality and I do n't think the brush will ever wear out . Great add-on item .	1
Mmmm . This brush gets quite a workout here . How do you talk about how wonderful a bottle cleaning brush is without it getting creepy/awkward ? & # 34 ; Oh , its amazing ! ! & # 34 ; & # 34 ; It sure gets the job done ! & # 34 ; & # 34 ; Better than all the rest ! & # 34 ; & # 34 ; So Sturdy ! & # 34 ; Etc . Moving on ... ... I did n't really bottle feed my babies , but I did have a supply of bottles and got the cursory bottle brush to along with them . In the past 3 years or so , I was also given one and bought another , all rusted , never felt like they did a thorough job , and/or broke in half or the end bristles flattened . Then I saw this one on Amazon , and using other OXO products with success I bought my 4th bottle brush in 2.5 years . It 's been over a year now and I 'm still contented with the one I have with no thought to replace it . Bristles still clean effectively , wand/handle part is still maintaining the perfect balance of flexible but sturdy , and it does n't look grungy . I do like the bristles better on this one than other brushes , soft , not wiry , but obviously sturdy . I was always left with the feeling that other standard bottle brushes would carry bacteria on the sponge ends , or scratch the inside of the bottles because they were too wiry . Now , I do n't give bottles to my kids anymore , but I do bottle our own kombucha and want to make sure the bottles are quite clean , this brush serves that purpose . I find that I also use it to clean sport bottles , juicing equipment and cylindrical objects more often than not . I even took it over to my moms house to clean some coffee carafes ( worked great ) and accidentally left it there , and I really miss it this week of being without it ! ! Oh , I also use it to clean my Chemex . Works so great ! ! ! I would like to say that a narrower one would be wonderful too , this fits in everything except my flip top bottles . So OXO if you see this , Pretty Please ! ! !	1
well made and fits about anywhere you can think of : glasses , bottles , coffee pot , nalgene bottles . great oxo quality	1
We bought this to clean inside water bottles . It works perfectly for that . We do n't use it for anything else , but it works great for cleaning out water bottles .	1
I really like this bottle brush ! The length is perfect and the handle is awesome ( it wo n't slip out of your hand when wet ) . The only reason for four stars is because the bristles are just too soft . I like tougher bristles ( almost impossible to find ) . Other than that , it was a great purchase and I use it all of the time for glasses , stainless water bottles , glass water bottles , etc . A must have in the kitchen .	1
Bough some glass water bottles recently and this brush is the perfect tool for cleaning the insides , A little , hand detergent and warm water with this brush work miracles !	1
This brush is GREAT ! It 's long enough for me to clean my 40 ounce LL Bean metal water bottle , and my Nalgenes , and my Polar insulated water bottles . The brush really helps me get all of the gunk and deposits built up in my bottles . The brush also seems high quality , and looks as if it will last me for a while .	1
My wife 's Nalgene bottle has that narrow opening that 's impossible to clean without this brush . The brush itself has some great firm bristles , and the stem has some slight flexibility , but will stay firm and does n't seem it 'll break unless you 're deliberately trying.We also have the baby bottle brush from OXO that we plan on using for bottles , so if it 's anything like this bottle brush , I know it 'll work splendidly .	1
this was just what i was looking for to clean all my reuseable water bottles ... i use it for my sigg , klean kanteen , and nalgene.. it fits in all of them with ease !	1
Works great in all my water bottles . The brush fits perfectly in my camelback big chill and keeps it clean and germ free . The bristles are holding up nicely and it is plenty big enough to reach even the deepest water bottles . Highly recommend if you use water bottles .	1
This is probably the best Oxo product I 've purchased ! It is supremely flexible and adaptable , and I 've used it to clean all sorts of things around the kitchen and in fact the whole house.AND , when you 're done ? It cleans itself in the dishwasher ! How cool is that ? ! You 'll love having this thing in the kitchen -- perfect for cleaning out water bottles , condiment bottles , whatever you have ! Recommended without reservation ! : )	1
this bottle brush fits in my takeya water bottle , and others , without any issues . it seems to be well made and cleans bottles accordingly . it does what it is supposed to !	1
I am so thrilled that I found this brush ! I was looking for a long time for a good brush to use with our nalgene bottles . They are hard to clean with the small mouth but this brush allows to get all the way to the bottom of our large nalgene bottles and cleans them well . If you have Nalgene bottles , you need this brush .	1
For years I had bottles and other narrow-mouth containers that needed cleaning . I would always find some way to cram a sponge or blast hot soapy water in there . I knew bottle brushes existed , but for some reason I just never got one . Somehow it came to mind to buy one on Amazon . This one is definitely a winner . It does n't scratch like the cheap little ones my mom has . The long bristles and slightly flexible wand mean it can really clean just about anything very thoroughly . Just do n't accidentally mix it up with a toilet bowl brush .	1
I do n't know how I lived without this . I was sick of my dishwasher eating my nalgene tops and having to wash the protein shaker bottles three times to get them clean . Perfect size , easy to use , and effective . Just add it to an order and you wo n't be disappointed .	1
I just got this product yesterday . I used it to clean out 4 of my water bottles and their lids . Along with a long handle , the brush has bristles that stick up on the top and allow me to clean the bottome of the bottle very easily . The brush also cleaned up under the rim of the bottles easily due to the direction of the bottom bristles . It rinsed off easily and dried quickly . So far , so good . If it falls apart within 6 months I 'll revise my review ; otherwise I 'd recomend it for cleaning water bottles/baby bottles/etc .	1
It is perfect for cleaning my water bottle that i use everyday for gym and work . Thanks to this brush i enjoy cleaning my bottle .	1
This is without a doubt the best performing bottle brush I have ever had the pleasure of using ! I have been deprived all these years !	1
Great product that is build very well and is sturdy . I have another one that I bought years ago and this one is made so much better .	1
I purchased this to clean my thermos since I have started taking my lunch to school . This is perfect for that and also my water bottle . I just stick it in the dish washer to clean it .	1
If you have a bunch of water bottles and thinner travel coffee mugs- YOU NEED THIS BRUSH ! Makes cleaning all those things so much easier . Ca n't believe I did n't buy one of these earlier !	1
Purchased this bottle brush because using a dish brush to clean Nalgene 32oz and 44oz is not a possibility.Glad I bought it ; worth the price . The bristles are soft and pliable but still get their scrub on .	1
It suits the purpose of all my glass bottles , for juicing and glass drinking bottles ! The handle is bendy to allow you to work around the whole inside . I just love it , as I was a little skeptical if it would fit some of my narrow drinking bottles , ended ups fretted more than I needed to . Love it for the price point too !	1
I got this to properly clean mason jars , nalgenes , wide-mouth Siggs , especially near the curved parts . Seems to rinse well and does n't hold stains and dirt . Dries pretty quick !	1
I like this brush , though I do wish it had a suction cup , or something , so it would be easier to be near the sink . We lay it on the counter and let the brush part hang over into the sink . It does a good job , though , even though the bristles are not as dense as other bottle brushes . We had the other OXO brush with a stand , and while it was nice , the stand had a tendency to get moldy unless washed often . For the price these are easy to replace when necessary .	1
This is a great product to clean children 's sippy cups with . The bristles on the brush are soft enough where they wo n't scratch the cup , yet durable to do a thorough job cleaning the cup ! I highly recommend for parents that are obsessed with clean cups !	1
I bought this brush so I could maybe use it in the bathroom to get scum out of the sink drain however it will not go in the drain . It was much bigger than I thought but that is fine , I will use it for something else . Still looking for a small headed brush to get down that drain !	1
I bought this brush because I use 3 KOR Aura bottles ! I am VERY particular about how my bottles get cleaned , even going so far as washing them twice if I feel like anything is left over in them . This bottle brush works VERY well ! It is not abrasive , but is firm enough to clean and is VERY good quality ! I HIGHLY recommend !	1
This brush is long enough to clean the bottom of my tall Thermos . It is very handy , and I am pleased with how well it works .	1
I 'm a fan of OXO products and this one is no different . Well made and designed . The grip feels nice and has grooves , the shaft is slightly flexible and the brush is the correct size for what I needed . The only reason I did n't give it five stars is that I think the bristles should be a bit stiffer , otherwise it 's perfect .	1
My favorite brush .	1
I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it . So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled . This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations . Not good as a toothbrush , but good back scratch ! I took of one star because it does n't really look so good , and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier .	1
I have found so many uses for this brush . Yesterday I was trying to clean the inside of a narrow mouth of a tall flower vase and was so happy to remember I had this item . Cleaned it up quick as a wink .	1
my dishwasher always leaves crud in the bottom in my juice glasses that i could n't reach by hand . this is perfect . it 's flexible too , so i can be rough and not worry about it breaking .	1
This is a nice , high-quality bottle brush.It 's very long , so I can clean my huge bottles as well as little ones . It has a nice rubber handle on the end.The bristles are n't too stiff to get it through tight spots , nor too weak to scrub the bottle effectively.I 'd buy it again .	1
This brush seems to do the job pretty well . The handle is in a perfect length for what I need it for . There are some things that I recommend making modifications to the design.The brush is soft which made it easy to insert into a narrow opening of a bottle . I feel that it could be stiffer . The brush also had more spaces in between that I had expected.This brush is made for light cleaning	1
It works well . It should last awhile and it does n't have any fragile parts that would be prone to breaking .	1
This bottle brush is wonderful for cleaning all those hard to reach spots in water bottles or kettles . It has a lot of bristles but can still fit through most bottle necks . Highly recommend to anyone wanting to keep their water bottles sanitary .	1
Does a great job of cleaning out my protein shaker bottles . I used to just use a sponge , but I could n't get in the little crevices ( like the shaker spout ) to get out the protein that had dried in there . With this brush , I can easily get into little corners , while also scrubbing out my shaker quickly and efficiently . The bristles are also soft enough that it wo n't scuff up the plastic shaker . All in all , I would consider this a must for anyone who does n't have access to a dish-washer , or who only has one shaker and does n't want to run the dish-washer for one item .	1
Perfect to scrub out my Nalgene on the fly water bottles . Works really well , and does the job with a little bit of dishwashing soap .	1
I love that this has soft bristles that are tough enough to get stuck on foods off with ease . The handle is very sturdy unlike other bottle brushes and is the perfect length . The OXO Good Grio handle is perfect for anyone with grip issues like arthritis or carpel tunnel .	1
There are so many water bottles out there today that it 's easy to end up with a collection of 10 or 20 before you realize you have nothing to use to clean the very bottom of the bottle.This brush does a great job reaching those tiny corners way down in the bottom of the bottle . The bristles are flexible enough to be pushed into even small bottle necks so it will work for pretty much any water bottle out there today . You can be brave enough to drink tea or juice out of your water bottles once you invest in this !	1
This works great . It does make you tired - I 'm sure any 'elbow grease ' scrubbing would , but it works . It could use a little bit stronger bristles , but then maybe it would scratch .	1
I use this to clean the grout in the shower . Scrubs well , the handle is comfortable . I spray the shower down with a bleach based cleaner like Tilex , let that sit for awhile while I clean the rest of the bathroom . Then I come back with this brush and any discoloration comes out without much effort . So far the brush has held up well for my purposes .	1
Brush is of good construction and handy for those hard to reach places . My only complaint is that the bristles are a little soft and get bent after a good thrashing , but held up pretty well after some abuse . I have used it for tough jobs like cleaning around the base of the toilet , shower drains , etc . & # 8203 ;	1
I used this brush to get out tough stains from years of use on granite flooring . The grout became as good as new . I recommend this .	1
This brush is a partner in house cleaning . The angle of this brush allows me to get into thosehard to reach area , i.e . shower stall corners , shower doors , corner grout areas .	1
If you are getting the grout cleaner , get this brush . It is easy to use and easy on the wrist .	1
A great multi-purpose brush ! ~ ... .OXO Good Grips Grout Brush ... .all these items have been great this brand as far as price and quality this is great for some serious scrubbing I like the long handle ! ~	1
Purchased for my housekeeper to use on cleaning up grout lines that had aged . She used it with a grout solution , brush has held up well and she is pleased with product . In fact she liked the OXO brushes so much - she asked me to purchase additional styles for tight spaces .	1
I 'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint . The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon 's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy , easy to manipulate and clean , and stands up to some tough cleaning situations . The bristles do n't deform under heavy use , which is usually what happens with other brushes I 've tested . We 've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail .	1
I 've used a similar hand scrub brush and loved it . This grout brush has a longer handle though it 's scrubbing surface is not as long . It is excellent for use in corners or when you do n't feel like kneeling .	1
I have white tile in all the bathrooms , and the grout gets stained . Nothing for it but to scrub the grout occasionally . Not my favorite job , but this brush is comfy and the handle is at the right angle.Here is the recipe I use to make grout cleaner . I think it works better than commercial sprays and it 's cost-effective:1/2 cup of baking soda1/3 cup of ammonia1/4 cup of white vinegar7 cups of waterPour this into a spray bottle ( not one use previously for bleach ; I would suggest buying a clean , new bottle at the hardware store . ) Spray on , scrub . Do not ever mix with bleach ; ammonia and bleach release chlorine gas from the bleach and it is instantly toxic to the lungs and can overpower you quickly .	1
I am old enough to remember & # 34 ; The Fuller Brush Man & # 34 ; . After the Korean War , many veterans sold door-to-door for the Fuller Company while they were trying to get back into civilian life . The & # 34 ; Fuller Brush Man & # 34 ; came through our neighborhood several times a year . Since I was the one who usually opened the door , I got a good dose of his wholesome first impression . He carried a large well worn leather case . When he opened it onto our living room floor , a fantastic array of brushes would spill out . My mother always bought something.I guess OXO somehow fills the gap left by the missing & # 34 ; Fuller Brush Man & # 34 ;	1
OXO makes great household products and what I love about this brush is that you can reach the corners of the shower tiles . It 's comfortable to hold and it scrubs really well . Highly recommended .	1
I 'm impressed with this brush . I had some dirty grout in my kitchen and this brush knocked it out with ease and it did n't even bend the bristles . I would buy it again .	1
This brush is considerably larger than a toothbrush and grips well in the hand . They call it a `` a grout brush '' ; not for brushing freshly poured grout ( cement ) , but for brushing in grout joints between tiles.I tried the brush in the shower using CLR liquid cleaner and the brush does a fine job of getting the CLR cleaner deep into the joints and the calcium , lime and mold deposits out . Also brushed the shower head several times and let the solution stand . Very satisfied about the results . Because of its narrow brushing head , the brush does well in the commode under the outer lip where fresh water enters and also down deep in the narrows of the commode.I also use this brush to brush the hardware fittings on my boat that have rusted . It works well.The brush is unlike any brush I have ever seen in the brick and mortar stores.When this one wears out , I will reorder another .	1
Pretty much every Good Grips product that I 've bought over the years has been great , and this brush is no exception . The bristles are nice and strong , so that even with some serious pushing into the grout of our shower , they do n't bend and stay in place . The hole on this is also a nice feature since it allows me to hang it in the shower for ease of use . Useful product !	1
Love this brush . It is sturdy and really does its job well . I am thinking of ordering another one to have as a replacement just in case I wear it out	1
Great for scrubbing everything ! I have one in each bathroom and in the kitchen . Am going to add another to the basket for cleaning various bird baths in the yard .	1
I just finished cleaning my kitchen and dining room tile . This brush is super and I am glad that I made the purchase .	1
Elbow grease required . Cleaning solution required . Dirty grout or shower floor required . Now , get cleaning ... .it wo n't get clean by itself .	1
This is a great brush for smaller tile areas , such as shower or tub walls . Probably not what you would use on a large ceramic tile floor , unless you are only going to spot clean an aria . Unless of course you do n't mind being on your hands and knees cleaning a large area.Living in Florida I have over 2000 SF of ceramic tile area to clean , and I do n't think I would care to do it on my knees . I am looking for a sturdy grout brush such as this but with a long handle . So far I have not been able to find one that suits me.This brush has a row of very stiff bristles in the center , and another row going around them that are not quite as stiff . The handle is quite comfortable to hold and work with plus feels sturdy enough to apply pressure . It did an excellent job on my shower wall grout , and some spot cleaning on my floor . This brush is also great for cleaning along wall edges and corners.Oxo Good Grips makes some great products at reasonable prices , I know since I have some other items from them . I would definitely recommend this brush .	1
This brush will make a good bathroom brush since it is narrow . It will clean behind the faucet and other tight area 's . I also bought the other set of two ( 2 ) OXO brushes ( a few months ago ) so now I 'm set for cleaning . I can throw away all the old tooth brushes . I have never found anything wrong with any of the OXO products I have purchased . Another great brush from OXO ! !	1
Really helps get the grout clean and also really helps in tight corners . I do have to scrub a little , but this really takes a lot of the work out of it which helps me clean less and play with my baby more !	1
I love most of OXO 's products and this brush is no different . Its size is optimized for working on the tough grout lines . I recommend this brush .	1
This is a great grout brush , with a nicely designed handle that 's perfect for giving the grout an good ole marine scrub . Unlike the other reviewer , I think this makes a lousy dish brush . The brush is designed stiff and narrow . For a dish brush , I would prefer something with more surface area , like the ones OXO makes .	1
I love this brush for grout and other narrow places . Worked nicely on the tops of baseboards .	1
This works well as a vegetable brush . Some of the bristles are already coming out with minimal use , thus the reason for only four stars .	1
This brush was purchased to a shower in an apartment we lived in . It was terrible to keep clean . I little bit of a bleach based cleaner and this brush did the job well . The handle is also very comfortable .	1
A great scrub brush for floors and carpets ! Sturdy , easy to use and very cost-effective . I was very happy with the quality of this brush and it does a great job on my kitchen floor !	1
good scrub brush that is easy on the hands	1
This brush is durable and will withstand the toughest of chemicals.I like the hand-friendly grip and thorough cleaning that can be accomplished by this brush .	1
I love this product and would recommend this to everyone . The price is so much less and comes in fast . Our family loves this product and use it often !	1
Got this for scrubbing some mildew/mold out of my shower tub . It works like a charm ! It fits nicely in my hand and seems to be of good quality ( bristles not too hard or too soft ) . As always , impressed with OXO products .	1
This brush is easy to hold , very comfortable in the hand , and has very strong bristles to clean the shower bottom and tile . I like the size of the brush because it requires less effort than the smaller ones .	1
I was surprised , and delighted , the brush is much bigger than I had expected . It works great ! ! great deal , would def recommend , I use it to clean carpet stains and it does n't hurt my hands and does a great job .	1
This is a really heavy-duty brush . It is perfect for scrubbing spills out of the carpet and soap scum in the shower . I like the soft-grip handle , also .	1
Get 's the job done perfectly , hard bristles breaks up the soup scum , and grim easily very easy to grip and handle .	1
well designed scrub brush ; easy on the hands	1
This brush has a wide rubber grip handle and firm bristles . What makes it a bit unique is its size - at 11.1 '' it is nearly a foot long . You can use it to clean a large area where a smaller brush would make the job tedious , and in some instances to avoid bending as much due to its reach.The bristles are synthetic and fairly heavy gauge . They can be used to clean corrosive acids and alkalis although this was made for use in bathrooms and kitchens . I tested it on the shower floor and it 's perfect for that type of work.The instructions say this brush can be cleaned in the dishwasher . With most brushes , the high heat of a dishwasher would cause bristles to fall out .	1
I actually bought this in a store but then could n't find the same one til I found it on Amazon . It was one of the best dish cleaning brushes I 've used -- also works well on pots and pans . I liked it so much that I ordered a second one to have on hand just in case they quit selling this one .	1
the brush head and overall size of the tool was larger than I expected - but so much the better to clean something fast , right ? the colors of the tool appeal to me , I 'm trying to psych myself up to clean more . the brush did n't seem too making my arm/ shoulder ache .	1
I use this brush in the kitchen and love it . It is great for scrubbing dishes , pots and pans and also to scrub the sink out once the dishes are done . Another great OXO product	1
After getting this brush I thought the overall size of it might be a problem , but proved it was n't for the things I have used it on . One excellent job it does is cleaning a stainless steel sink . The bristles are long and stiffer making the task less tedious and using about half the time and elbow grease of the way I have been doing it . One thing that could be improved is the handle . It should be just a bit smaller around and have finger notches on the bottom for improved handling . That is the only reason I did n't give it 5 stars .	1
Does what it says -- gets in those hard to reach places like the corners of the tub , grout , etc . The handle is perfect . OXO always makes quality stuff and this is no exception . I actually got rid of the mildew in the corner ( well , the bleach did ) because I could actually get in there for once .	1
I couldnt find a brush big enough for our tiled shower that would get the corners and this works great . Cant say enough about it	1
I 've dedicated this brush to shower maintenance , and another in the kitchen would probably be an equally good investment . Oxo brushes stand up really well and have just the right amount of stiffness to speed the work along.This brush cleans the shower stall with much less effort than previous methods , thanks to the large brush head and perfect grip and angle on the handle . It does the flat surfaces quickly and easily gets into the corners and crevices.Here 's a great tip I 've learned after much experimentation . Clean your shower with a spray bottle filled with one cup of white vinegar and three cups of water - add a few drops of dish soap if you like . The vinegar retards mold and mildew very effectively , and it 's much easier on my nose than the chlorine bleach products I had been using.The same vinegar solution is great for water bottles , watch bands , and anything else that has a tendency to start smelling like an old dish rag . It 's cheap , it 's safe , and it 's effective . Wish I 'd known about this a long time ago .	1
This is an excellent shower brush . I hang mine from my shower caddy where it 's ready for use.Gets into corners and the bristles are stiff enough to do a really good job .	1
My male significant other can not hit the oval bowl . The tile floor must be scrubbed weekly . This does the job without too much pressure on the joints ! .	1
I highly recommend this brush . Like all of Oxo products , it is well designed , easy to handle and does a superior job of household cleanup .	1
I just finished brushing my screens and cleaning my screens and doorways and am happy that I purchased this brush .	1
I use this brush to clean my tile grout . It gets into small spaces very well and the brush head is strong enough to clean the grooves in my shower grout line which is very narrow .	1
I bought this to hold small cosmetics in my bathroom and I have it suctioned to a tile wall . It is a perfect size for eyeliner , mascara , concealer , and other small cosmetics that I want to keep in easy reach . The hold has been great so far - it has been about two months and it has not slipped or fallen .	1
Suction cups work well ... holds a few light to medium weight items and is very easy to clean ... transparent view is very helpful for seeing any dirty build-up against the sink ...	1
I 've had three of these for over 10 years ( clear and white ) . They are handy in the medicine cabinet , kitchen , and shower . My only gripe is that the back is not flat ( bows in ) . I 've replaced the suction cups a few times because they get flat/dried out and wo n't stick.Please make one that is deeper for pot brushes , utensils , or tubes of hair products !	1
Does exactly what it 's supposed to . I do n't have to worry about it rusting . It 's easy to clean . It does come un-stuck once in awhile but no biggie .	1
I use it in the bathroom , to hold the sponge I use to clean the tub . It adheres to the bath tub walls very well . My tub walls are a weird cheap kind of plastic , so I was not sure at all if it would stick to it . I just wetted the suction with a few drops of water , and it sticks without problems .	1
This Sponge/Scrub Caddy works very well in my sink . It looks good and serves it purpose.I 'm sure I will be looking to buy more for my friends and family for gifts .	1
I do n't have a deep sink so I did n't want one that was too big.this is perfect for holding my scrubber brush with handle , metal scrubber , and sponge.The suction on it is great too on my stainless steel sink.I pull it upward off of the top edge when I want to take if off to clean.Once on though , I have to either do that or pull really hard to get it to come off which is exactly right .	1
I like that it 's clear . It has perforation underneath for better drainage and fast drying . It provide just enough space without taking up to much space . I recommend it !	1
after struggling with the metal holders for so many years , rusting away after few months each time , I finally found a product that holds up , dish washer safe and easy to maintain ! ! highly recommended . suction works great as well .	1
I just stuck mine on the inside of my claw tub and put some soap and razors in it , it 's perfect .	1
I like the size of the pouches . I have not tried the stopper yet . I think smaller pouches and more of them would be better since I travel alone . For a family this size is better .	1
I have used this kit three summers in a row to wash my delicates while traveling abroad . The sink stopper is a wonderful invention and tends to work on most tumba and deep sinks . On very small sinks , it will still work but you may notice it does not hold as tight of a seal . The soap packets are a good size , though I typically only use about half of the packet for six or so undergarments . As long as I fold down the top of the packet , the rest of the Woolite stays inside . The Woolite is easy to wash out and leaves my clothes clean and soft . I would highly recommend this kit to anyone going on a trip who may need to do an emergency load of laundry !	1
I took this and used the wool lite twice on a 16day trip . Never needed the stopper . Suggest that a come with a reusable container , since the box was crushed flat . Maybe a plastic case the size of a travel first aid kit . And adding some nylon line for a clothes line would make it a complete package .	1
This stopper worked in five different hotel rooms on our last trip . Even when we stay in first class hotels as we did in Istanbul , I will not pay $ 12 to get pajamas laundered . I think that 's criminal . Okay , so maybe you do n't need the packets of Woolite , but it 's a nice touch . Worth the money .	1
The Woolite packets were perfect size for a small European washer in the apartments we stayed in during a 3 wk trip to Rome , Venice and Bavaria . The sink plug was great as well but I used it to do dishes : )	1
The glass is top notch ... I have used some that were thinner and therefore less bulky in the pocket , nevertheless , we give these two purchased a 5 star as they are better than any I could find nowadays ... .yep , buy again after I loose these ...	1
i love ittes tools General Tools 532 2.5 Power Pocket Magnifier nice to see any thing small to be big in your eye	1
Light , compact , easy to have with me at anytime . Just what I wanted & cheap enough to not worry about . True glass and unlike other reviews , looked good all the way from center to the edge . I bought two & both were identical . For the price they ca n't be beat , but some people expect magic & ca n't be pleased at all . This was a good purchase just for a little visual aid-not a a scientific instrument .	1
I bought this as well as the Carson Pendant magnifier . The lenses are both the same size.For starters , the GT 532 took 12 days to receive it ! The Carson arrived in two days . Both ordered the same time ... I recently had cataract surgery and opted to have my nearsightedness corrected , which left me unable to see anything closer than about 4 ' . I bought an assortment of reading glasses from Walmart , as well as these two magnifiers , just to get by for the moment.If I had to pick one or the other , the Carson is the winner . It is less bulky , and IMO , allows me to see better , with or without glasses.It has a better case as well . I will keep this for those moments when I forget what I did with the Carson Pendant magnifier.I also bought a lighted , free standing/handheld , 5x Carson FH-25 magnifier at Walmart for $ 13 . I have not found any better product than what Carson has to offer .	1
The battery was exactly what I needed , it was not outdated and arrived quickly . I sometimes find it difficult to locate the right button battery when one is needed ; seems there is no rhyme or reason given to battery names . When I open a product to see what is needed , I look up the battery number online and frequently get hits on batteries that do not even come close to resembling the one I have . I am not sure why button batteries have so many different equivalent names , but I have included some below for this battery in the hopes it will help someone else.A76 equivalent batteries : 1128MP , 1166A , AG13 , D76A , G13A , GPA7 , GPA76 , LR44 , LR1154 , L1154 , PX675A , PX76A , RPX675 , S76 , V13GA , 357A , RW82 , KA , A76 , 208-904 , SB-F9 , G13-A , CA18 , CA19 , LR44 , A-76 , 76A	1
It 's a battery . How much can you really review it but to say , do n't buy generics of these little batteries . They also do n't like the cold . Seems to zap the life right out of them .	1
obviously a major bran with lasting energy . Pink bunny is right ; - ) it keeps my electronics going for a ridiculous amount of time	1
Not sure how to rate a battery . By life expectancy ? I bought this for a toy and it is still going strong .	1
I needed this size battery and I was having trouble finding it in any stores around me . Amazon has everything ! The batteries are for a little light that I attach to my keys and I can click it on when it is dark and find the key hole without any trouble at all .	1
Holds a charge very well . Energizer is the best . They again want to many words for a minimum . Get this brand .	1
Great value . I have a tough time finding odd size batteries , not anymore . Thanks for the quick delivery and great price on the batteries	1
We needed these batteries for our garage door opener . They are a weird size and were much more expensive at brick and mortar stores so we bought them at amazon ... as usual , they were the best price !	1
As a battery , it works great , and it was very cheap . I would definitely use and buy again . very worth the money .	1
There 's not much to review here . Batteries came packaged and shipped well . They work in my garage door remote . No complaints here .	1
Brand name as described . Nice fresh batteries , so expecting to have excellent operational life and good shelf life for extras . Great pricing to boot , so value is exceptional .	1
These are a great price . My garage door opener uses these for the remote and at Radio Shack they are almost $ 8 a piece because they are 12 volts .	1
These Energizer A23 12 Volt batteries have met all my A23 battery needs . When my wife says & # 34 ; Honey , do you have an A23 battery for this obscure device that uses an absurd battery size ? & # 34 ; I can happily say & # 34 ; But of course , I always keep a few A23 's on hand , my dear. & # 34 ; I use a lot of quirky gadgets . This fit into the remote for an outlet control switch , as well as several other things I 've encountered . Overall , recommend .	1
This vendor provided fresh batteries and their price was the lowest , when shipping cost is considered . This particular battery is hard to find where I live but is in two devices I own , so I was glad they were listed on Amazon , where you can shop intelligently .	1
I needed these for my wireless doorbell and could not find them at the local store . They arrived promptly , were very affordable and now I can hear my doorbell again !	1
Energizer batties last a long time..I use these batteries in my cameras..This battery was at a great price & free shipping !	1
This size is hard to find in stores . Glad they are here on Amazon . I use them in my ceiling fan remote and my wireless doorbell .	1
Batteries are used in various equipments at home and office . Last month I needed a set of A23 batteries and I could find them on Amazon.com . It was good for me to find them easily on Amazon and even cheaper than the market . These energizer batteries helped me to fix the door of my room . Overall it is a good product .	1
When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes , like the A 23 , they are usually priced at $ 3- $ 6 . I have other gadgets that require an off size . If I paid retail store prices for these batteries , my money would n't go as far , as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give , is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container , to house all of the odd size batteries . I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries , for a fraction of buying one from a retail store ; pretty crazy .	1
this battery was super i was having trouble with my garage opener and bought this battery and it worked fine	1
I purchased these to replace in my house alarm devices and they have worked flawlessly . The originals were off brands so I 'm hoping the Energizer brand will last a long time .	1
Works as a battery should . Works in my garage door opener remote . Good price for online purchase with free shipping .	1
I use these batteries for my wireless doorbell . They last a long time & easy to install . Batteries are good quality . Highly recommend	1
Energizer A23 BatteriesHad YEARS left on use by date .	1
Branded batteries at a nice price . Ordered these for my garage remote unit . Save the money and an unnecessary trip to the store and order here : )	1
These little guys work as advertised and much cheaper than the local battery shop . Normally I would buy locally but they were rude and 3 times as expensive .	1
These 2 batteries worked great with my garage door opener . You can not beat the price found here compared to the stores !	1
I used these for our gated community gate clickers . I 've had some of them last more than a year . Very happy with product and will continue to order .	1
I bought these batteries for a doorbell chime unit ( it 's obviously battery operated at the doorbell ) . Gee , the batteries `` look '' good ; the real test is how they hold up . This review was in November 2012 ; I will update this depending on how long the battery ( you get two , I only needed one for the doorbell device ) lasts . It was great to purchase so cheaply on line , and shipping was free . How great can that be ? !	1
The item worked perfectly and Amazon 's price was half the price others offered it for . This battery has the energy needed .	1
What can I say , they are Energizer Batteries and they work like Energizer Batteries do ... which is great ... great product for the price and they last a long time .	1
Price for this battery is cheaper than any local retailer could come up with , and it works as advertised in my car remote . Tested voltage on the brand new pack , and it reads about 12.5V	1
These work great on my burglar alarm .	1
Bought these for my garage door opener . They do what they are supposed to and last longer than the generics .	1
Could not find locally and found on Amazon ! Fast shipping and I 'm pleased . This goes in a remote for a plug in lamp module switch and I like being able to turn the lamp on remotely	1
Works fine , what more is there to say .	1
This is a long lasting battery . I use it in my garage door opener , and it lasts a long , long time !	1
It 's a freeking battery . What 's there to sayIt has a package which I assume cost half the price if the batteryIt 's a freeking battery . What 's there to sayIt is a name brandIt 's a freeking battery . What 's there to sayIt worked .	1
Used as replacement batteries for my garage door remote control , pleased that I could order exact replacements and get them virtually over night ... ... ..	1
These are great little batteries . I use them in our remote for our ceiling fan and they last several months , even in summer when we use the fan more often . Will continue to buy these on Amazon .	1
ENERGIZER A23 BATTERY BOUGHT IT ON AMAZON.COM FOR A WIRELESS REMOTE CONTROL OUTLET SWITCH . THEY ARE VERY SMALL BATTERIES , AND THEY WORK IN THE REMOTE .	1
I was happy to find these on Amazon at a reasonable price as opposed to what you 'd pay at a sporting goods store to replace the batteries in your LED flashlight . The batteries seemed fresh and I got an excellent stream of light from the flashlight , just like new . 3 months later and they are still going strong .	1
The is listed as a watch battery ; must be one gigantic watch . This is the replacement battery for the 3 door remote cntrol which came with my Overhead Door/Genie chair garage door opener .	1
Could not find any reasonably priced batteries this size at any retailers in my area . Ordered from Amazon they came I put them in my small Garge Door Opener and tey are excellent . Very happy with the product , they worked the first time I put them in and continue to work everyday . The manufacturer should be proud to work with Amazon to offer these at a good price and easy access .	1
These are name brand batteries at a good price . What more can I say ? They were just what I ordered and they arrived on time .	1
The overhead light/fan in my bedroom was going wonky . I ordered new batteries . The correct size came , in good shape , fixed the problem , and with a spare for next time . As this is used a lot , it was critical that I get it fixed , the batteries arrived on schedule .	1
They work , they work . The date was acceptable and was n't expired . They do work good and have powered up the device without issue .	1
Whether you know it or not , these batteries are actually made with 6 mini-button cell batteries stacked on top of each other . If you remove the outer casing , ( NOTE : ONLY on this brand ! ! ) you 'll see them all stacked . It 's a lot cheaper than buying the button cells individually when you need to replace batteries in a calculator or watch . Great price for these too !	1
These batteries are hard to find in the store , that 's why the best place to buy them is through Amazon	1
They 're Energizers , what can I say ? Every other brand compares themselves to Duracell or Energizers , so the brand name pretty much assures quality . These perform as expected .	1
Liked the quality . Nothing to dislike . Yes , I 'd recommend this product for others . What 's to say about buying fresh batteries that do n't expire before you get home ?	1
I have to have these batteries for my garage door opener remotes . I have only had to replace them twice in seven years so I think they are pretty good . It 's an Energizer . Not sure I can really say a hell of a lot else about them . The particular seller got them to me within two days if memory serves . So good deal .	1
A battery either works , or it does n't . These work fine , and they 've been working for over a month since I received them . The non-Amazon dealer sent them fast , in their original Energizer packaging , with a far-distant expiration date .	1
I happen to have one of those heart rate monitors that regularly eats batteries , so I am glad I ordered these , because they last about a month , which is terrific . The other & # 34 ; regular & # 34 ; ( not extended like these ) batteries pooped out in a couple of weeks . It sounds sad , but I 'm thrilled about the fact that I 'm only changing a battery every month . Great product at a great price .	1
It works . Not much else to be said . A much better price than buying locally , and it was shipped promptly .	1
We 've bought batteries from this company before . The card it came sealed in was printed in 2011 -- but since Energizer batteries are good for many years that is not a problem . The important part , it works and the one of a kind little desk clock that I bought in Taiwan over 10 years ago works again -- all for a price that is at least 1/3 of what I would have paid locally . Great dealer that ships fast .	1
This battery is just great . I ordered one for my HP laptop 's remote controller . I would rate this battery A+++++ , would buy it again . Although it has not shipped yet , so I am not sure on the quality , I can guarantee this is the battery you need for your HP Pavilion entertainment PC dv6915nr with Altec Lansing speakers . I know , because I did the hard ground-level research , opening the controller , finding the battery , removing the battery , examining the battery , finding the name of the battery , replacing the battery , closing the battery containment area , and so on .	1
Ordered this from Best Deal Supply and it fit my watch perfectly . I was a bit skeptical but it was not expired and was legitimate .	1
Energizer does not let you down . These batteries are lasting very well . I would definitely buy them again , when needed .	1
Energizer Lithium Coin Watch/Electronic Battery , 3 Volts , Ecr2450 .. energizer ! The only way to go for your battery needs ! Shop smart !	1
Sure these batteries are good . They last about three years in my alarm remote . I get them through Amazon 's free shipping offer when I have $ 25 or more worth of purchases . The box store charges 5 bucks a piece for these ( if you can find them ) and Amazon charges less then half . Kind of a no-brainer to me .	1
This watch battery works well and has a very reasonable package . The price is a bit high . Disadvantage is that you need to distinguish that with CR2032 since the thickness are different . Recommend that for use !	1
I have n't tested this battery so just going by the fact it works and my digital scale is bright and readable , package was in good condition and battery is new and sealed .	1
The batteries do not come in the individual retail packaging as pictured , but are from a bulk roll ( I put a picture above ) . The only reason this really matters is because they do n't have an expiration date so you ca n't be sure how fresh they are so for now they only get 4 stars . Other than that , they do appear to be authentic Energizer battery and the price is very good . I will be using these in my bathroom scales and will report back on the battery life .	1
I used these to replace the battery for my car 's intelligent key . They work fine , but it is too early to tell how long they will last .	1
This is the best deal for batteries . I used to pay $ 5.99 for each 2032 battery at Walgreens , now I pay $ 1.45 each on Amazon , do the math ? I was being ripped off all my previous life . These 2032 batteries delivered fast and they were fully charged , and free shipping .	1
This was a great value.It was cheaper than anywhere I could find in the stores like Target or Safeway . No tax too.Plus since I have Amazon Prime , shipping was free without having to buy over $ 25 of items .	1
I hate reviews that say something to the effect `` It 's a battery . What else can I say ? '' . Answer : Nothing ! Please do n't write and waste space ( as I 've done here ) .	1
Energizer makes good quality batteries . This is the one that matched my remote control . Would rather buy a brand name than a generic .	1
they fit perfectly in my two computers and they are still working great to keep the time accurate and to help the cmos store the information properly . the price was great and i am very happy i bought them .	1
While these seem to be acceptable batteries , they are NOT packaged as shown . I was wary of these batteries because they came packaged in a strip of five . So far , they have performed well . I am just not satisfied these are really new Energizer batteries as shown .	1
I had to get a new battery for my XM radio remote control . This was the size I needed , but I never thought about getting it on Amazon . I went to the drug store and paid over $ 5.00 for the same battery . When I went home to install it I thought I would just check to see if Amazon had one online . Sure enough , I bought this one and took the one I purchased from the drug store back for a refund . I even told the counter person that I had to return it due to the price . So far the battery works just fine .	1
I use Renaissance wax for micro polishing of all metals , and for woods of any finish . The secret to using it is hand rubbing , as opposed to the way you wax your car . It cleans and polishes while laying down a coat of preservative wax . This 0000 pad from 3M is perfect for the application . You can use the less fine pad ( they use different colors for different coarseness/fineness ) , especially on steel tools.I use 0000 steel wool . But sometimes you do not want to risk leaving any of those fine steel fibers behind to rust . These pads actually hold their shape better than wools , which tend to separate under pressure , so these go further.I also like these pads for pumice and rottenstone , getting a good load of paraffin oil . You get good control over them for polishing and fine abrasive work . I can size them for fingertip work or for whole flat hand coverage.You can not do a French Polish with them , but they are suited to the alternative , Qualasole , of for any other rubbing finishes like tung , linseed or Danish penetrating oils.Check out 3M 's whole line of grades , but this is the one I buy most often . I would not use this fine 0000 grade for scrubbing pots because it will choke with caked on food too fast . But for the above , it earns all five stars even though it does not completely replace 0000 steel wool .	1
Good size , alot in the box , well worth it . Helps cleaning light rust easily and considering how soft it is , no damage was done to the item .	1
I received the steel wool but have not used it yet . I will let everyone know what I think hopefully after this weekend when I continue refinishing my Dresser and Mirror set.UPDATE : I did use some of these on the above mentioned dresser and am very pleased with them . They are very durable and a good price . I highly recommend these for anyone who needs this type of steelwool pad ! ! ! !	1
Nice pack , brings alot . I used it to scrub the neck of my guitar to remove dead skin and all other s*** on it , and then used Bore oil on it . Neck looks brand new .	1
This is very good steel wool . Use it on stainless steel , wood cabinets and wood flooring . Does n't leave residue as some othersdo . Would buy again .	1
These are steelwool pads , what can you say . Nothing wrong with them . Worked just great on chrome on my tricycle . For me these were a good deal on Amazon .	1
Good for the price . Fast shipping , great value ! I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys woodworking or anything that requires steel wool .	1
Great price for a quality item . I Have bought other wool that came rusted and packaged very poorly . Great product .	1
For only $ 5 it is a lot of Steelwool . I did n't need that much but now i have a big package laying around my house . Starts fires good .	1
I love this stuff ! I used it on a couple of tables that had some nasty deep gashes and this helped to smooth them out . thx .	1
This was a good pack of steel wool lightly packed but it will do what we purchased it for . Happy with buy .	1
Not much to say . I put this cartridge into my APC back-up , charged it , connected it to my equipment and all is well . Ca n't tell about longevity yet .	1
This is the second replacement battery I 've purchased for my SmartUps SC 420 . The first battery lasted about two years , the replacement about the same , so I 'm expecting about two years out of this one . Always been very happy with the battery replacements and a much cheaper alternative to replacing the whole UPS .	1
I needed to replace a failed battery in a Back-UPS 500 and this was the ticket . I was concerned with buying knock off battery and having it fail quickly , so I spent a few extra bucks for the APC unit . It 's been fine for several months now and I hope to get a few years life out of it .	1
Bought this to replace a battery in one of our battery backups for our computer at our work . Worked perfectly !	1
I somehow added the wrong battery to my cart , and since it 's hazardous can not return it.The one I received was in great condition , and will work with my other Back-UPS ( it did n't need a new battery , but I guess I got one now.. ) These are really easy to swap in and out , so you do n't have to buy a whole new unit .	1
This is one of those items , that make you at first think , eh I have mixed feelings . After your gums get accustomed to the massage , and the intensity of the brushing , you will know that it is one of the single best things you have done to your smile.When flossing , my gums used to bleed , now they do n't bleed any more . I had gum lines that were receding , even though some of them were only back 1 to 3 on a scale of 10 . I had a wisdom tooth that incurred periodontal disease , The dentist went around it with a metal probe , to release the infection , and gave me a prescription for antibiotics . He explained that it would be healed , but still must be pulled because it would for sure return . I guess once that infection gets down under the tooth , it sets up shop , and returns . I had to go to a dental surgeon and have it removed . After that , I got a scolding from the dental hygienist . She explained that all the the bleeding that I was getting from my gums when flossing was not normal . It was due to bacteria . So I started to scrub more often , and floss , and use an alcohol based mouthwash . ( Most of them are ) It was n't until I started to use the Sonicaire toothbrush that I really noticed a change . No more bleeding gums ( unless I abuse the floss ) My gums have moved down . I had a crown placed on a tooth that was far enough gone , that when the crown was put on , I could take a fingernail , and push the gum up slightly , and feel the top of the crown . Now I push the gum up with my fingernail , and the top of the crown is entirely inaccessable.Why should you get a Sonicaire toothbrush ? Consider that most tooth aches come from Gingivitus . That is an irritation of the gum line . Tartar and plaque join forces with bacteria , and wage a war with your gum line . Scrubbing with baking soda and some peroxide used to take care of that for me . ( Being careful not to swallow any of it . ) Now with Sonicaire , I never get Gingivitus any more . The next level is Periodontal disease as I explained earlier . Once you get that , if it is a crown , or a tooth , they are forced to do bridgework . I do n't know if you have checked the prices on bridgework , but forget about that new car . Regular brushing with Sonicaire , with regular dental check ups , flossing , and a good mouthwash , and you can help prevent all of that . Now let 's get on to the fun stuff.I can notice a substantial improvement in the color of my teeth . They are white now , instead of manila . ( I wo n't say yellow ) Seriously , I smile in the mirror with the light on , just to delight in the new shade of white my teeth have become.On a practical note : I use the Sonicaire in the shower , even though the instructions tell you not to . Immersing the unit , is definitely not advisable . Rinsing it off after every use is neccessary . Therefore I took it upon myself to use it in the shower , being careful to park it on a ledge that is not in the line of any overspray . Then when I am done with my massage , I mean brushing , : - ) I give it a quick rinse , holding it straight up , so the business end is not getting force fed . I have n't had any problems with it . I really like using it in the shower , makes me feel like it is a luxury massage for my teeth . I even renew the toothpaste application , to the head , for my lower teeth . The unique thing is that the head is vibrating so fast , that if you would take it out of your mouth in front of the mirror , you would have a clean up job to do afterwords . A zillion little bits of toothpaste would be splattered about . A problem that disappears when using it in the shower.The unit keeps a good charge . About once a week , I put it back int the charger . Interestingly , is that their is n't any of the usual metal contacts associated with a charger . The unit is sealed , as is the base . So when it is in the charger , it somehow moves through the plastic in the base into the charger without any direct metal contact . When the unit loses a charge , it tells you by flashing a light inside the on and off button . Takes the guesswork out of it.I had bought their kit with the multiple heads earlier . I just bought this unit for my mother as a gift.One last benefit that I want to mention , is that it enables you to get a really good brushing in areas of your mouth , that you may not brush as well due to accessability . Since the unit is doing all of the work , you no longer need a long staging area to get a sweeping motion going . You just place the Sonicaire on the spot , and the rapid pulsing , gives that area a great brushing.I have to admit , that when I got the unit at first , I thought , wow this thing is aggressive . I guess that is why the manufacturer programs it to go easy for the first couple of weeks , gradually building up to a full speed . After a while , it feels like normal brushing to you , and a standard brushing with a manual toothbrush seems like a poor excuse for the job.Get this Sonicaire toothbrush . You will be glad you did . Hope this helps .	1
After I bought one of these and started using it , my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare . I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I do n't have to go as often . So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year . Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing . The charge holds plenty long , the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough . Buy enough replacement heads , because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months . I actually look forward to brushing my teeth , and I certainly do it after drinking coffee . My teeth look a lot whiter .	1
I 've always thought I did a good job brushing , but when a relative ( who works at a dentist 's office ) got us one of these , I was amazed . My teeth felt SO much cleaner , and they made a big difference in dental checkups for both of us.I 'd highly recommend this to just about anyone - good tooth and gum care is really important , and this tool helps make it easy !	1
We have 3 of these , and have been pleased since the beginning ( about 3 years ago ) . Your mouth will feel wonderful after each use ( though it takes a bit of getting used to , and beginners are warned to use the included damping ring to decrease the intensity for a while ) . We have had 2 occasions to return one to the factory , but they were replaced under warranty with little fuss ( both dead batteries ) . There have been subtle changes as newer models have come out . I like this latest itineration best , as its tiny green LED on the on/off switch makes an adequate navigational beacon through a dark bathroom . One word of caution : my family will not travel without these things , so while I preach 'pack light ' , they tote their Sonics everywhere we go . Fortunately , one charge lasts at least a week , so the charging base is only needed on extended trips .	1
The Sonicare toothbrush is really a breakthrough . I 've had mine for almost a year ( on the advice of my dentist as well as other Sonicare owners ) , and it works extremely well.Not only does this device make brushing my teeth quicker and more relaxing , but they simply get cleaner . More important , my dentist says the health of my gums ( leading cause of tooth loss ) is extremely good since I started using the Sonicare.The feature where it beeps every 30 seconds is pretty useless , and the auto-off after 2 minutes is downright annoying ( I like to brush for 3-4 minutes ) .The brush can run for a week between recharges , and the charging stand is small and attractive . The whole thing is easy to keep clean , quite well designed.One caution : you need to replace the brush head every 6 months ... . However , it 's worth it for better dental and gum health .	1
I bought this toothbrush system wondering if it really lived up to the hype . At first I noticed that it was too aggressive . My teeth and gums were n't used to it . I thought I had clean teeth , and would brush regularly . After visiting my dentist for a cleaning , the dental assistant razzed me about my gums bleeding when I flossed . She said that was due to bacteria . So I brushed and flossed , and used mouthwash , and that helped . Then I bought the Sonicaire toothbrush , and that made all the difference . Now when I floss , their is n't any blood , or at best an occassional little bit . This system really works.I had a tooth that was other than a few thin shell walls , down to my gumline . The dentist was able to save it , and install a crown . I noticed that I could take a fingernail and pick at the top of the tooth where it met the gum . After using the Sonicaire system , my gums have healed and moved down so much that it is impossible for me to push them out of the way enought to feel that crown top anymore . When gums recede due to plaque and bacteria , that is when we get gingivitus , and even worse , periodontal disease , which results in having to remove the tooth . Do yourself a favor . A stitch in time truly saves nine . Buy this Sonicaire toothbrush system . You can not afford not to . It will save you way more than the purchase price in dental bills.Now when I use it , their is n't even a little bit of discomfort . I even consider it a massage of sorts . I use it in the shower , even though the instructions tell you not to . I am careful not to submerge it , or get it too wet . You need to rinse it off after every use anyhow , so a quick rinse under the shower , keeping it held straight up , works great . I have had it for over 6 months , and the brush is still in like new shape.The kit comes with more than one brush head , which is a savings if you are using it for more than one person in the house . If you are just using it for yourself , one head is enough . It is a savings to buy this kit though , because the multiple heads are a bargain over purchasing them individually . In the long run you will need a new head.Sonicaire programs the unit to start of mild , then increase over the first couple of weeks use to full strength . Now even at full strength I do not experience any discomfort.I have an 88 year old mother who due to mild arthritis , is unable to grasp a regular toothbrush very well . With the Sonicaire , then body is light , yet large , and does all the brushing for you . If you have a parent like that , this makes a great gift.Even if you are just buying it for yourself , buy it , and have the toughest gums , and brightest teeth on the block . I am sorry that I was n't able to have one of these for all time . Hope this was helpful .	1
I purchased this tooth brush about five years or more ago . I have used it continually with the exception of a few in between spurts of just not using it . Like vacation , moving , etc . My dentist always ask me what do I do to keep my teeth so free of plaque . I explained it was my Sonic tooth brush . She complimented me at every six month visit . I moved across country and my tooth brush was packed and I use the manual for a while and before long I began to feel pain and bleeding on one side around the gum line on my back teeth . I found my sonic , charged it and in about a week my teeth and gums were back to normal . My teeth feel very smooth and clean , somewhat like they feel after the dentist cleans them and they feel cleaner longer after brushing than with a manual tooth brush . I would recommend that anyone that cares about their teeth to sacrafice and purchase the Sonic Tooth brush . They want be sorry . I certainly am not . Mine has lasted for over five years without any problems . If this one wear out I certainly hope Sonic stay in business so I can re-buy ... ..	1
This toothbrush is well worth the money . It feels strange at first but you 'll be amazed at how clean your teeth are and how healthy your gums look after a few uses.I struggled to get my husband to brush his teeth more than once a day -- I was concerned about the health of his gums . Since purchasing this toothbrush he uses it 2-3 times a day . You always know that you 're brushing for the recommended time , that you 're removing plaque , and you 're not brushing too hard and damaging enamel . The super-clean feeling in your mouth encourages you to brush frequently.Our teeth are whiter through the use of this brush alone -- no bleach or & quot ; whitening & quot ; toothpaste needed . Bad breath is no longer a problem , either , now that our gums are healthier.In addition , the unit has a sleek , modern design that looks good in the bathroom . The brush heads have a ventilated , plastic cover to protect them from dust , etc.I am going to buy this for everyone in my family next Christmas . It 's that good !	1
Great new shave after using them . I like how Amazon tells you when you order a product like this the date of the last order . I had gone a little too long with my old heads , big difference with new .	1
Be sure you have the correct model number wrote down and make sure these are the blades you use and need . I looked for a while and found these blades were the best price I could find . If you ca n't wait for them to be delivered check for stores in your area for them and see if you can buy them at the price they are without the postage and handling charges . They may be a few bucks more but you will have them in your hands .	1
I 've had many Norelco razors in my 50 years of shaving with all being renewedwith a fresh set of heads after a few years . Every Norelco I owned always failedthe switch so be mindful of that if you want new heads.Switch OK ? Then buy new heads and keep on shavin '	1
Anyone who rates these replacement blade heads lower than five stars should be b*tch slapped back to Mongolia.These blades basically turned my old Norelco into a brand new electric shaver ! I was *this* close to junking my shaver and buying a nice late-model electric shaver until I came across these 'Made in Holland ' replacement blade heads . I do n't recall my shaver ever working this well . Thanks Amazon !	1
The replacement heads ordered on line from Amazon arrived on the day promised . I have installed the blades and the razor shaves like new . It is a nine year old Norelco . Each year I replace the blades and experience a close , even shave -- just like it was when the razor was new .	1
works as it should , I have since moved on to shaving cream and a razor as I am not a kid anymore and like a smooth clean shave . with an electric razor I have NEVER had a shave as clean as a razor blade can give .	1
This Philips Norelco HQ6 Replacement Head was an exact fit replacement for the worn out one on my shaver . It was easy to install , and brought my shaver back almost to the original shave quality . It seems to be holding up well.This replacement head was difficult to get locally , and the Amazon price was the best I found anywhere on line .	1
I purchased these Philips Norelco replacement heads for my husbands electric shaver . They were easy to replace and worked perfectly .	1
After SEVEN years , my husband decided it was finally time to replace the original blades that came with his Norelco . These work fantastic , as expected . They seem to provide almost as close of a shave as a razor blade . Overall , very pleased .	1
I have previously used a triple head Norelco razor that was corded so I decided to try a cordless product and got it at a reasonably discounted price in my Gold Box . I do n't really think there should be much adjustment for me because I was already using the old model . I agree that the shave is very close but I have to really work at it and it takes as long to shave as ever . I have tried to use pre-electric shave and simply wash and dry my face with equal results . I tried shaving with a cord connected and without the cord and the RPM 's of the unit seems to be about the same . It is exceedingly quiet and is quite smooth over my face after the shave . Cleaning is simple , just washing it . I plan to continue to use it for the next several weeks to get a fair trial . Although it was a little bit more expensive than I would have liked , it seems to be a decent shaver . I give it 4 stars simply because it does n't make shaving any faster for me .	1
I 'm a Norelco guy and have been for years since trying a couple of others when I first started to shave . Past cutter heads have been quite worthy and satisfactory so I do n't expect anything different for this order .	1
I have had very little problem with this unit . Now & then , when trying to get the lather to come out slowly , you will get a little bit of very hot water in your hand right when the lather first starts to come out . It 's not comfortable , but does n't really burn . The lather , itself , comes out nice and warm and feels very good on the face . Whether it actually helps your shave or not , I have no idea ; I have n't really noticed a difference . The great benefit is the nice warm lather on your face .	1
this is my third Oral-B toothbrush and it 's the best one yet , faster , more powerful , works great and lots of features I was n't expecting .	1
After using one for 7 years or so the old professional gave out finally . The NEW one I had to buy at Target ( sorry Amazon when your toothbrush is broke asap is more important then price ) . I did the full charge last night and let it run down without a brush on and I am charging it back up to full . Just got done using it again before bed . This electric toothbrush is better then their last model and more powerful . I can tell by how clean my teeth are . Thanks a bunch Oral B for the High Quality Product .	1
I originally purchased thinking I was going to get a 50 % cash back . But that seems to not have worked but I am still pleased to have this now.Follow the 3o-second procedures and it works great.Definitely worth it from normal brushing . My gums bled at first but have now stopped . Floss at least once a day still recommended.Good luck with the Oral-B Toothbrush it wo n't let you down.Brushing takes a few days to get used to .	1
I think I 've owned this for five years now and it is still working great . My only issue is that the brush starts to come apart after maybe 6 months of use , and pinches your lips gums etc , forcing you to change the brush . Probably should change it anyway , but I do n't like it when a company forces things on you this way . This is the first toothbrush I ever owned which has a brush which falls apart and hurts you like this .	1
I bought this as a gift , and the recipient was quite happy with it . So far it seems comfortable , easy to use , dependable , and to do the trick it was purchased for . It was an excellent value .	1
If you 're as unfortunate as I am and seem to have a talent for producing plaque you will find this Oral B to be a life saver ! No more do I have to endure endless scrapings when I go in for my semi-annual dental check because the regular use of this product has greatly reduced the amount of plaque on my teeth.Thank you Oral B !	1
I 've used an Oral B since 1993 , and am on my 3rd one . The first one finally `` burned '' out a few years ago , and the 2nd one I somehow left in a motel room , and it conveniently got `` lost '' ( hope the maid is enjoying it ) , as when I called that afternoon , `` nothing had been found '' ... These can not be beat . Like many other reviewers have said , the dentist 's ALWAYS notice the difference when people switch to these.Personally , I always brush on high speed until it beeps , then I switch to low speed , and re-brush , and then go onto my gums and tongue before stopping.A Great Tool , from a Reliable Mfg. , Not to be Beaten ! If you 've not used one of these , by all means , GO OUT AND GET YOURSELF ONE , NOW ! ! You 'll NEVER regret it ! ~operabruin	1
I started using this toothbrush on the advice of my sister ( thanks , Sis ! ) and also after reading some studies confirming that an electronic toothbrush that uses both rotary and in-out pulsating motion will improve gum health . My dentist did notice an improvement in tartar build up . He said that he notes when patients use this brush and that it seems to give good results.Plus Points1 . This brush has both rotary in and in-out pulsation . This is the combination that is better than rotary-only and that studies show gives better results.2 . The replacement heads have an indicator that shows wear ( the bristles become white . When the decolorization on the bristles is down to about 1/8 inch , it 's time to change the head. ) 3 . There is a timer to let you know you have brushed 2 minutes ( recommended brushing time. ) 4 . It does feel like `` after the dentist cleaned '' if you go the whole 2 minutes.Minus Points1 . If you do n't recharge according to the manufacturer 's recommendation initially , you will not have a long battery life.2 . The manufacturer does n't make this entirely clear , but you should run the charge DOWN on the brush , then recharge , for maximum life . If you do n't do this , you could experience a short life-span on this toothbrush . This happened to someone I know ; the company made good on the guarantee and sent a replacement.3 . If you DO let the charge run down , the brush is not so vigorous at the end and it seems a bit wimpy to do a really good job near the tag-end of the battery charge.4 . You should go the 2 minutes for effective use , but who likes to stand there , spitting foam and grimacing in the mirror for that length of time ? 5 . You should use it gently or you can scratch your gums.6 . The replacement heads are a bit expensive.Despite the minus points , I rate this toothbrush five stars because I love how my teeth feel and it makes flossing afterwards better because I seem to have less tartar buildup . I am considering a second one to keep in my bag at work . I hate to brush with anything else.Highly recommended	1
I charged it for 18 hours as it requested from the get go . Once I start it up , after about every 15-20 seconds , it hiccups for 1 second . Not bad of a product . Feels different since I use less toothpaste now ( compared to brushing manually ) . I feel like a lazy hygienist now , with the lack of desire to brush my own teeth because the feeling of `` Success ! '' and `` Clean ! '' isnt ' there anymore . However , I will use this product until it is dead . I also bought it discounted from the amazon gold box.If there were no hiccups , I 'd give it a 4. that 's the main defect ( with mine at least ) . I do like the waterproof-ness , but I do n't need it since I do n't brush in the shower.-MCUpdate : Upping to 4star	1
My dentist scolded me for thrashing my gums by brushing too hard and for having too much plaque . He insisted I get the Braun Oral-B , which he said was the best of its kind . I 'm glad I did . The design has a soft mode for people with sensitive gums and it has cut down my plaque , far better than had I used a conventional toothbrush . Also the device is easy to use and maintain so I 'm confident I 'll use it consistently . Finally , I must say my teeth feel far more clean and smooth now . The Braun no doubt will have prevented me from getting some serious dental work .	1
I got this model for only $ 22 because CVS was clearing out the 1000 from their shelves for the arrival of the newer stock . My previous brush was the Oral B `` Cross Action '' AA battery powered brush . Until I used the 1000 , I was satisfied with the Cross-Action . It was a good brush using a single battery and the brush heads were fairly good quality being Oral B.But now there 's no going back . Honestly , I would not have purchased it - had it been selling at its former retail cost of over $ 80 , but since my daughter is a manager at a local CVS , I was an early bird for the clearance - and sprang for the $ 22 . So looking here at Amazon to see what others paid and what they think of this model prompted me to write my two cents worth in the form of a review.The motor is comparatively very quiet , yet obviously powerful . The cleaning result is superb , and noticeably improved over my former brush . The brush heads do seem tougher so far as the expected life and the dual action head is my personal fav . My teeth feel noticeably smoother and gums more massaged . Tongue cleaning with the brush is very thorough as well . A good toothpaste will accent itself using this brush.Personally , I find the timer to be a slight nuisance more than a feature . I agree that over brushing - like applying too much pressure - is bad . But when I 'm brushing , I do n't like the nanosecond interruption of the motor frequency change - however-minor . But that 's just me.Other reviewers commented about the battery , as if it 's `` a negative '' feature . Admittedly , it would be better if it was Lithium-Ion , but then its cost would have been even higher.However , being a Ni-MH battery pack - it is an improvement over the older Ni-Cad type . It has more capacity and can not be over-charged by the included charger . The owners manual is very clear to point this out and even instructs to discharge it fully every ( 6 ) months to maintain optimum power , duty cycle , and battery life . I do n't think that is a negative , just the proper care for a device using this type of battery . Those interested could consult Wikipedia on NiMH batteries for a better scoop . Personally , I have not noted any degraded operation whatsoever in constantly charging mine all times when not being used , ( and I doubt anyone else would either - for years ) .The only negative I see is the price for the replacement brush heads . Hopefully , being made more aware of the cautions stated against over-pressure and over-brushing will also yield longer brush head life . The pricing seems outrageous . The cost for the better brush heads OTC @ CVS was $ 26 for a ( 3 ) pack . Amazon lists them for less , but they are as much or more after shipping is applied . So make 'em last long as you can as you enjoy this great quality toothbrush !	1
When my old Braun Oral-B conked out after 7 years of twice-daily use , there was no question I would replace it with a new Braun . I 'm quite pleased with this model . It seems that the brushing motion is smoother , quieter and faster than my old faithful , and my teeth feel like they 've just had a cleaning at the dentist . Braun always comes through . Really could n't be more impressed or happy with this product .	1
It 's been 8 months since I purchased this item . I 've enjoyed Oral-B brushes for a long time and this one ranks right up there with the others I 've tried . I like the battery indicator lights , which are great for traveling . The battery holds a charge for a very long time . There are a nice variety of brush heads that will work with this model as well . Good deal !	1
I bought two of these during a Today 's Deal and I am so glad I did ... ..these are really perfect . The dual head does a fantastic job , the brush is much lighter than my other electric toothbrushes of the past , that have all been hiding under the sink . Just a few days of brushing with this and you will notice a huge difference in your gums and your teeth .	1
I bought this shaver about 10 years ago now , from a local store.I 'm posting this review more as a testament to Braun 's German made shavers , than necessarily as a review on this particular shaver , because you ca n't buy this model any longer.It 's survived 10 years ... of morning shaves ... of being packed in luggage and thrown on airplanes or taken on trips in a car trunk . Probably a drop or two . It still feels SO solid in my hand , not cheap at all . Shaves wonderfully ; I replace the cutter/foil system about every 18-24 months . Cleaning system still works great . Every mechanism and button works just as good as new.In short , it 's a beautifully engineered product.I will reiterate , this shaver was made in Germany , before Braun started shifting production to China . Their higher end shavers are still made in Germany . I have a little bit of experience with a Chinese Braun as well , and it has been OK too , but it 's not 10 years old yet . So YMMV.Hoping to get another 10 years out of it . : )	1
This is the most comfortable razor that I have ever used . I have tried a variety of razors over the years . Because of my prominent Adam 's apple , it was very hard for me to find an electric shaver that felt comfortable . The Panasonics and the Norelcos always irritated my neck area . That was even after using them exclusively for several weeks . Fortunately for me , I found this Braun . I have been using this for two years . So far , it has performed very well . The Panasonic Wet/Dry gave a closer shave . But it also irritated my skin the most . The Norelco that I had before also shaved very close . But I had a hard time shaving my neck area with it . So , I finally gave the Braun Syncro a try . After a while , I started getting the most comfortable shave ever from an electric.The shaver itself would get 5 stars . However , the cleaning system that came with it is a bit expensive to maintain . The cleaning cartridges that the cleaning system uses can get expensive . I suggested to Braun that perhaps they should sell a reusable plastic cartridge , along with a liter ( or 2 ) of the cleaning fluid in bulk bottle . The consumer could simply empty the plastic cartridge and then refill with fluid . That would save the consumer quite a lot . The cleaning system does a good job of cleaning , lubricating , and recharging the razor .	1
The Braun Synchro System line consists of several models : 7570 , 7546 , 7526 , and 7505 . The top of the line is , naturally , the 7570 . I suggest you go to [ ... ] to see the spec comparison , as this site does a good job of showing you the differences . In a nutshell , they ALL have the same motor and cut exactly the same . The differences are in the number of indicators ( the 7570 has an LCD screen ) , some additional chrome trim , and the inclusion of the cleaning system ( the 7505 comes without it ) .I chose the 7526 . At the time I bought it , there was quite a price difference between the 7526 and the higher 7546 and 7570 models . The 7526 comes with the cleaning system , while the 7505 does not . Other than that , the 7526 simply has only one LED indicator to show the remaining charge , and no decorative chrome trim on the head . Quite frankly , I see no need to get the 7570 in order to see exactly how much charge I have left , how long the cleaning system has been running , or how many hours I 've spent shaving ! All models will show a flashing red light when the charge is low . At that point you have two shaves left . Simply plug it into the socket when you 're done and in about an hour or two you are fully charged . How hard is that ? Although I bought the 7526 , the 7570 shaver is essentially the same unit , so this review will apply.Details on the shaver itself : The Synchro System has a new high speed motor , and I think it is the fastest one for a shaver under $ 200 . I find I get a very close shave , when using traditional foil shaver techniques ( see Epinions.com website ) . Also , a single charge seems adequate enough to operate the shaver for two weeks . The motor and battery are light weight , so this shaver is not heavy , and it fits nicely in your hand . Three usage settings are available : 1 ) pivoting head , 2 ) locked head , and 3 ) trimmer extension . I use all three at various times -- once again , Braun thought this out very well . It is also fairly rugged , but the plastic can crack if dropped from 4 ' or more onto a hard tile surface.The cleaning system : I find this device very ingenious , for a variety of reasons . First , it really does clean the shaver well . Second , it is n't overbearingly loud . And third , it has indicators to show when cleaning and charging are done . The fourth is revenue . Braun was very clever about this . If men are only going to spend money once every two years on the foil and cutter block , how could they make more money ? Well , this cleaning system is the key . If the cleaner is used the way Braun recommends , you end up replacing the cleaning cartridge every month . The smart thing to do is buy the `` value pack '' , which brings the cost down to about $ 5 per cartridge . How do you know when to change it ? Well , the cleaning system will tell you . It detects when there is a high amount of particles in the solution , or if the solution is too low to flow through , and will flash the red cartridge light while simply not running until you replace the cartridge . The cleaner unit itself is slightly big ( about 12 '' tall x 5 '' round ) , so you may have a little difficulty finding a place for it . And do n't think of bringing it with you when traveling ! ( You do n't really need to clean everyday anyway ) .But , I found a trick that Braun will despise me for . You can minimize the use of the cleaning solution and save big $ $ $ . How do you do this ? Well first of all , after each shave I dump my `` whisker debris '' down the sink , like you would normally do with the Flex Integral . It does n't take long -- simply pop off the foil , tap it in the sink , blow on both sides of the cutter block , replace the foil , and you 're done in 10 seconds . This reduces the number of particles in the cleaning solution . So , why use the cleaning system at all , you may ask ? It does do an excellent job of cleaning the cutter block , and whisker dust that is stuck on it and within the head and foil holder . A tedious task , even once or twice a week . When do I use the cleaning system ? Well , usually whenever the shaver needs to be recharged . At this point , I take out the cartridge from my drawer , remove the top plugs , and slide it into the cleaner . Then I slide in the shaver and let the cleaner do its work . When the cleaning and charging is done , I remove the cleaning cartridge , reseal it with the plastic plugs , and put it away . This way the solution level does not get low from evaporation ! Clever , eh ? The only catch is that if you try to charge the shaver while mounted in the cleaner without the cartridge , it will not work . But you can always plug it in directly , without the cleaner . Anyway , that 's my trick for getting around one this somewhat minor drawback . Some have said it 's nice to have a `` clean '' shaver to use each time , but I find the cleaning process works well enough to use once per charge ( just dump the whisker debris after each shave ) .If price is no object , get the 7570 . Otherwise , I recommend getting the 7526 if you find it priced low enough below the 7546 and 7570 . NOTE : I paid $ 139 for my 7526 in 2000 .	1
I have used this shaver for nearly 8 months and I love it ! This product was given to me as a gift to replace my old electric shaver that was n't doing the job . Now , I can truly say that the Braun gives me the closest shave of any electric shaver I have used . Say goodbye to your blades ! I have sensitive skin , but the Braun does n't irritate like some electrics can . It is very quiet and easy to operate . It is comfortable to hold , too . Cleaning is a cinch ... .but with the automatic charge and cleaning system , you do n't even have to agonize over getting the cutters super-clean . Just let the machine do the job for you every few weeks to get it good-as-new.This electric shaver is so good that I have trouble finding anything to criticize . One drawback is that the entire unit ( cleaning/charging base ) takes up quite a bit of counter space . But , that is a minor complaint for a product this exceptional . I would definitely buy this product again and will recommend it to anyone interested in a new electric shaver .	1
OK.I 'd like to give a small background . I was a long time blade-only user . Gillette 's Mach 3 Turbo gave me the absolute closest shave I 'd ever gotten when combined with Gillette Edge shaving gel . My biggest problem - the blades price . $ 15 for 4 tiny lil blades ? WAYYY too overpriced . I must have spent about $ 120 on blades alone.I 'd tried the rotary type and other of the in-line type of electric shavers . The rotary kept snagging my hairs , and the inline did n't cut at all . So I was a little apprehensive about going back.I 'm an African American whose facial hair grows rapidly . I find I have to shave twice a day . As a working man , I often do n't have time ( and am too lazy ) for that . So I picked this up at Rite-Aid ( who has it for $ 30 cheaper than Amazon ) .My first impression was that it felt very well put together , and smelled very nice.I need to put this up for the African Americans out there , because in order for this shaver to earn its keep , there are some things you need to do first , or it will not work.First , you need the right electric pre-shave cream . I use Williams & quot ; Lectric & quot ; Pre Shave cream . It makes the hairs very easy to shave.Second , you MUST shave with a razor the very first time . Especially if you 're prone to razor bumps . The blade is designed to help get rid of the bumps . If there 's bumps , the foil will not cut close at all . After you do the first shave with a razor , then use this for maintenance , and I guarantee you that it will do its job.Third , DO NOT wash your face beforehand ; wash it after . if you wash your face beforehand , the hairs soften and get harder to cut . Since we have curly facial hair , it will naturally aim for your face instead of straight out.Fourth , after shaving , wash your face with a good face wash , like Clearasil or something . IT will clear off the dirt , oil , pre-shave , hairs , and everything else.Fifth , finish everything off with a good aftershave.Once you 've done all of that , use the razor as a routine . I use it twice a day , I clean it once every two days . There 's no need to use the cleaner EVERY day ; that 's how you run out of fluid fast . In fact , I just use a compressed air can ( keyboard cleaner ) to clean between the blades . Works just fine for me.I have about 5 more steps to my routine . Here 's what I do ( to make sure my face is the ultimate snooth it can be ) : - preshave lotion- shave with electric shaver- wash with Clearasil Daily Face Wash- quick Stridex pad over shaved area ( dries out any remaining oil ) - all over astringent ( I use Sea Breeze ) until there 's no dirt on the cotton ball- all over Clarifying Toner ( makes sure my skin tone remains consistent , I use Clean & amp ; Clear ) - aftershave ( I use Gillette ) I know it 's a lot , but my face looks strides better when I go the distance like that . I could always half it and just do the minimum , but my face does n't look anywhere near as good as when I do all of it . Besides , it takes me all of 15 minutes .	1
This is the third Braun shaver I 've owned and it lives up to the reputation . It gives a great shave , and I love having a clean shaver after every use !	1
This replacement system is easy to install and returns the razor to its original cutting capabilities . Holes may wear in the old sheath making it pinch and grab . This replacement system cures that quickly and easily . An excellent product all around .	1
These replacement heads for a Braun shaver are effective and worth the money . Supplier provided the heads right on time . Have been using them in my electric razor and quickly noticed an improvement in the shave provided . Would defintely buy they again and from this seller .	1
First I must say that I ca n't believe my Braun 5000 model rechargeable razor still charges after 15 years ( yes , 15 ! ) . I have a light but full-face beard and I use my razor for daily maintenance only . When my foil started to show holes I replaced it with this kit that included the cutting blades as well . For 20 bucks I have a new shaver ! Works like new and is quiet as new .	1
I have a Braun shaver that is 2 years old , and the foil head had some small breaks . It slowly became less and less effective . Just a few weeks ago , I purchased this replacement kit , and lo and behold ... .my shave now acts like it is new . One or two passes gives me a close shave.The blade and foil head are very easy to replace - so do yourself a favor and buy this .	1
This foil/cutterblock appear to be factory produced and shave just like the original blades did . Be aware that when you find these blades on Amazon there is a line just a little ways down the page that says `` There is a newer version of this item '' . That supposed `` newer version '' is cheaper but it is not factory and does not shave as well . I know because I bought it .	1
hubby had a braun 5770 . I did a lot a reading and was not sure if this would be a good fit but it works great according to him . The packaging was not the same as what is in the photo so I was a little worried but it works fine .	1
I have used Braun razors for years . I have never replaced the foil before . My foil began to wear out so that it had holes and the sharp edges would cut my face . I do not know if they are making the foils thinner . In any case , it was an easy fix .	1
The Braun 7000 series is a great razor . This new replacement foil head seems to have a more random hole pattern and perhaps a larger open to covered ratio . This results in a better shave for me especially on neck hair . Good stuff .	1
I have been shaving with Braun electric shavers for 20 years or so . Loved most of them ( especially an old , credit card sized one ) , but I particularly love my current 7000 series . Smooth , with no hair pulling and I never got any cuts , whether using it wet or dry . Buy one the first chance you get .	1
My shaver is 5 years old or older . Still these folks were able to get the replacement parts , Shaver is working great again.Thank you	1
What a great savings ! The in-store price at a local `` super '' store was $ 29.99 -- Amazon 's price is $ 19.99 . Thanks for the great deal ! ! !	1
Ordered this replacement for my Braun shaver and I 'm more than pleased with the results . Would buy this again when needed .	1
This is the replacement foil and cutter for the Braun Syncro line of men 's electric razors . Braun recommends that you replace the set about once per year . I am a gentle user and can get slightly more usage out of mine . Your foil and cutter may also last longer if you lubricate your razor with something like Remington 's lubricant . The Syncro 's cleaning system will also lubricate the blades for you ; however , the cost of replacement cleaning cartridges make that an expensive option.Basically , you do not want to wait until you have a hole in the foil to replace the set . A hole in the foil can result in your face getting a cut from the oscillating blades beneath . So please , change your foil and cutter set regularly .	1
Although the part numbers have changed over the years , this foil / blade combination fits my Braun shaver . I typically get two or three years of use out of these blades . This new set made the shaver feel like brand new again . I always store the shaver in the charger / cleaning base . The programed cleaning probably addes to the longevity of the blades.Changing the blades is super simple . Pry off the foil by the plastic base . Pull on the coiled cutter cartridge . Snap in the new cartridge , and snap the foil over that . Takes all of two minutes even when I have n't done this for a long time.Braun Clean & Renew Refills ( 3 Pack )	1
Changing the tires on the car certainly does n't make a new car ... but in the case of a new shaving head for this Braun shaver , it brings shaving back to the efficiency and speed that the shaver was when I first bought it 10 years ago .	1
I 've had various Braun razors since I was in bootcamp almost 15 years ago and my company commander required my face to be cleanshaven at all times . This meant I had to shave 4 times a day . The toll that took on my face with even a good blade razor was awful , and I only survived by eventually switching over to a Braun rechargable that shaved almost as close as a blade but with far less damage.I 've been a solid Braun customer ever since . Unfortunately , while consumer magazines tout electric razors as a money-saving tool , Gillette ( the owner of the Braun brand for several years ) has done a marvelous job migrating Braun customers to buy disposable replacement parts . The cleaning system that comes with most new Brauns is a great way to get an annuity stream from customers who mistakenly thought they could buy a Braun and be done with spending money.While the value of the cleaning system replacements is sketchy , the 7000FC replacement combo is n't . After anywhere between 6 and 12 months of use , the foil on a Braun typically gets one or two small holes . These end up giving you nasty , painful small cuts . The cutter too wears down a bit . I notice when I replace both shaving my entire face takes probably 30 % less time and is generally closer . Well worth buying.One other note . This product is a great reason to sign up for Amazon Prime . Repeated free two day shipping on a product at a substantial discount to stores - I do n't know how Amazon makes money on these transactions , but I 'm glad they 're letting us do them !	1
I have purchased these replacements for my 7526 twice now . once in 2005 and recently in Dec 2008 . I have gotten the correct part each time . The reviews that state that this will not fit are old and it seems as if the problem has been resolved.I am glad I decided to go the rout of replacing the blade and foil instead of buying a new razor . the 7526 is the best razor that I have had . Those new razors are expensive so I plan on using this one until dies .	1
My husband has used electric shavers all his adult life . He says that this razor ( Braun ) is the best he 's ever used . The cleaning and charging is simple and replacing this shield was also simple .	1
I bought my husband a Braun 7680 ( BRAUN 7680 Syncro Pro Shaving System with Clean & Charge Base ) in 2004 and he 's now on his 3rd replacement combo . Along with theBraun Clean & Renew Refills ( 3 Pack ) , it keeps his razor like new . It 's nice to get this at such an affordable price with convenient delivery .	1
It was a bit touch and go to make sure I was ordering the correct replacement ... ... but it was the right one for my husband 's Braun shaver . Made it just like new again . Happy husband !	1
If you 've got a Braun 7000 series shaver , you 've got to replace the screen and blade , and this is what you need . It 's best to change them at least once a year ... look for the best price ... When I found it on Amazon , it was the best price with free shipping and no tax ... but check around on the web !	1
I searched and searched everywhere for a foil to fit my husband 's Braun 7000 shaver . I thought we 'd have to chuck the razor at first until I went on Amazon and found exactly what we needed . The product was delivered within two days and it fit perfectly . I ca n't say enough about Amazon . They are AWESOME !	1
This is a must for my husband Braun electric shaver . It fits into a special slot in the shaver holder and will clean the shaver when needed and does a good job cleaning the razer . It is very easy to remove and install a clean refill . Highly recommend .	1
I use this with a Braun 8000 series activator ( 8585 I think ) . They are expensive ( so is the shaver ) but the system does work . The first one lasted over 5 months , using it every 2 to 3 days on average . No evaporation loss that I could tell . You can add a small amount of alcohol to extend it but I am not sure that is within warrantee , etc . I did shake the shaver blade out before using the cleaner , so that made it clean and fresh . However , when I finished the cartridge there was a very fine screen on the intake side so it may not have been necessary . One thing to note is that you can not take this on a plane - even if you check luggage.I am sensitive to smells , but the lemon scent was not a problem even though I could smell it when the freshly cleaned razor was right under my nose .	1
Very easy to use cleaning solution . It contains alcohol and you do n't have to worry about its installation , discard or amount used each time . There are indicators on the Braun cleaner itself telling you when it 's low . Change once a month .	1
Not much to say . Must have it . Does a great job . You can buy it in bulk ( for a year at a time ) and only costs like 3-5 bucks a month to own and operate . Go buy a stack of them .	1
Exactly as advertised . Basically the same cartridge that the unit came with , just the tags looked slightly different on the container . Still , works great and I plan on ordering more when the time comes !	1
As the razor uses these cleaners on an on going basis , try to stock up on the refills so I always have at least one on hand .	1
the braun clean and renew refill really work , my braun shaver works like a charm , I get a close shave and no irritation on my face	1
I am using refill number 2 of the 3 refills that came in the kit.I felt that refill # 1 did not last long enough . I talk fromexperience as I have been using Brauns cleaning system for more than a year.Refill number 2 is lasting much longer .	1
I have had this razor for a good 6 yrs or more now . Replaced the blades and screen twice and this cartridge about every 6 weeks . ITs like a new razor every morning ! The auto ship is great , a lot cheaper than I can get it locally . Even at the big W !	1
If you 're a Braun user , then you know these . What you MAY not know is that you can get these on & # 34 ; subscribe and save & # 34 ; . Absolutely perfect timing from Amazon - about the time you 're using the last one , the new box shows up . DEFINITELY the way to go .	1
I would have to say the is the best price I have ever seen for these . I would recommend buying a few of these at the same time to qualify for the free shipping . This will enable you to keep the best price available .	1
I have been using my Braun shaver for a number of years . I like the cleaning process very much . My problem is that I have not been able to find these refills in any of the popular stores . Finallly I did a search and found that good old , reliable Amazon carries these refills . And what a surprise ; a 3-pack . Excellent product and fabulous Amazon .	1
These refills for the Braun Shaver make everything almost maintenance free . Fantastic ! I would recommend these refills and the Braun Saver to everyone .	1
These are original quality replacements . When I first received my system I would only use the self clean function occasionally because I wanted to be frugal with the cleaning solution . The more I have experimented the more I agree with others that a lot of the fluid is lost due to evaporation whether you use it or not , so just use it . I tap my shaver 's screen daily to clean it and use this about once a week . I get several months out of each refill that way . If you 're not going to run it at least weekly , then remove the cartridge and cap it between uses for cleaning . Although at that point you have to ask yourself why you even bothered buying into the clean and renew system .	1
This refill makes it easy for you to clean your razor and keep it working perfectly .	1
Does the job . Ca n't complain and it is so nice to have them show up at my door . I do wonder how good of a clean my razor gets at the end of one of these canisters but there really is n't an alternative .	1
These worked great for my 790cc shaver . I do n't use the alcohol cleaning function much . I wash thoroughly with water after every use , and do an economic clean once or maybe twice a week . One of these end up lasting me 3-4 months easy ; I did n't have any evaporation issues like other people have mentioned , not sure why that is . Amazon `` subscribe and save '' is a great way to save money on this product , since it does seem rather pricey for just some alcohol mixture . They 're probably refillable if you can figure out how not to make a mess out of it ; although I 'd sooner dish out the 10 $ a year for these in convenience .	1
Works as expected . This is a continual purchase . Glad I have prime so I do n't have to wait for delivery when I run out	1
These are necessary for cleaning my razor and it is much cheaper getting them here than getting them at the store .	1
This is the replacement cleaning cartridge for Braun 's line of automatic cleaning stand for their electric razors . This cartridge will fit even the early model Syncros , all the way to the latest Pulsonics.I have not tried any of the newer Braun models , as my 7-year-old Syncro is still going strong . However , be assured that they all use the same cleaning cartridge , even though the newer models have an improved cleaning stand.The cleaning system works great . It cleans , dries , and lubricates the razor . However , bear in mind that the cleaner is alcohol-based . Meaning it will eventually evaporate . It starts to evaporate as soon as you open the seal . Each cartridge will last approximately one month . So your cost to keep your razor clean and lubricated , automatically , works out to about five dollars every month . That 's not so bad , considering that shaving with a blade will cost you money in hot water use , shaving cream , and replacement blades . I would say that perhaps the electric razor might come out cheaper . You can be like me and simply clean your razor manually . That 's even more cost-effective . But still , it is nice to be able to simply use your razor , place it in the cleaning stand , and then have it ready for you the next day , with no effort on your part.If you have a Braun cleaning system and you want to use it , this is your only option . So it really does n't make a difference whether I recommend it or not ( I do ) . As should be the case , you 've chosen your system based on the quality of shave it gives you .	1
These refills fit my cleaner perfectly . Be careful when pulling the snap as this can sometimes cause spillage . Disposal is extremely easy .	1
It 's the same cartridge that came with the razor - no frills packaging . I tried using just alcohol , but the filter at the bottom that strains your hair does clog , and is never the same after you try to clean it . This is the best bang for the buck that I have found thus far .	1
I 've been using the Braun cartridges for years with no complaints . The new packaging from Amazon is a nice improvement - the four cartridges are packed in a single box that is shipped as-is . Less cardboard waste than the old packaging , and a better price per cartridge.To make the cartridges last longer , re-use the plastic tab that covers the openings to keep the cartridge sealed when not in use . I run my series 7 through a cleaning cycle about once a week or so , and can get months of use out of a cartridge as long as it 's kept capped to prevent evaporation .	1
Not much to say about this cleaner really . It smells great and cleans my razor.The problem I really have is that it evaporates fast . But its because of the cleaner not the solution..	1
The 3-pack cleaning cartridges have a good price . It seems like the shipping cost is unreasonable but when you consider the cost of gas to travel for the product it probably comes out in the wash .	1
The clean and renew system works very well , at least for the shaver part of the razor . It does not remove longer hairs from the trimmer . It does seem to keep the blades sharper for a longer period of time , and to improve the `` feel '' of the shave . Each refill appears to last about a month , and the system seems to sense the total time the shaver is used and adjust the length of the cleaning . About once a week the system does a `` heavy '' cleaning . The system obviously has a `` cost '' associated with the refills , but overall , it seems to be worthwhile .	1
These cartridges are somewhat pricey . This fluid keeps my Braun razor working perfectly . I think it is now about five years old , and works as well as it did the first day . The razor was expensive at the time , so slightly expensive cleaning cartridges are to be expected . Given the grunge that 's in the bottom of these cartridges at the end of their life , I 'd never try to replace the fluid myself . I think the whole idea of saving a few pennies on an expensive shaver like this is a false economy .	1
These work great in my husbands shaver cleaner . Keeps his shaver head clean , you can actually see all it cleans off when you remove the old refill	1
This product is used to clean and lubricate your Braun electric razors . They are reasonably priced and last a good amount of time . They have a lemon-alcohol kind of scent to them which I have grown to really like . These really work too . Sometimes when I do n't get a chance to order extras and do n't clean my razor for a few days I can really feel the difference . Shaving is much more painful because the razor starts to pull your hair more instead of clipping it.Do n't get too complacent through . I would still recommend occasionally taking a brush and air can to the razor to get it extra clean .	1
Braun 's cleaning system is efficient and effective and saves you from manually cleaning your shaver every day . You just have to decide if it 's worth paying about $ 5 per month to have your shaver cleaned automatically for you . For me , it is . I take a tiny bit of pleasure every day in clicking the `` on '' button after shaving and walking away , knowing the shaver will be clean and ready to go when I need it . When I travel , I do n't bring the cleaning unit , so I use a brush to manually clean the shaver every day , which ( a ) takes a few minutes , and ( b ) is n't as effective as the cleaning unit . So it 's four stars , withholding one star just for the price .	1
they are expensive but it is what it is . If you want to save money take it out after each clean and put the lid back on so it dont evaporate .	1
This product is a must with the Braun Series 8000 Shaver ( and other models ) .I use it all the time .	1
My husband loves this product . Keeps the razor clean , fresh and helps give a wonderful clean shave every time . Easy to use and Amazon has the best price on this that we have found .	1
These clean and renew refills are needed if you have a Braun shaver with clean and renew system . Pricey but do work well to keep the shaver clean and smelling refreshed . Buy them here and save over the local retailer .	1
Good Price as I shopped around for cheapest way to get these refills with shipping ... can not find it cheaper anywhere , and this includes going shopping at stores . When making purchase DEFINITELY get the three-pack at minimum..and getting several is the way to go . In fact I have seen on Amazon a single refill for the same price as THREE ... DUH ! ?	1
People whine about cleaning cartridges for Braun razors but they really enhance the shave and are pretty cheap when you consider that you only buy one blade cassette a year . Buying a six pack is way cheaper .	1
Not really much to say . They do a good job of cleaning your electric razor and give it a fresh , sterile smell . No issues with it .	1
Product seems to be an exact replacement for my shaver . Definitely improved performance as compared to what I had been using as it was quite dirty and need to be replaced .	1
First of three must have had a defect . It leaked all over and wasted 2/3 of the solution . Second one seems to be working well .	1
I absolutely love these cleaners . I had some older razors that did n't have the built in cleaning like the Braun does and there is a huge difference to their performance over even a short period of time . The 4 pack I got was at a good price and I will definitely get more when they run out . Currently the 1st of the pack has lasted a couple of months with a cleaning every week and the indicator only just changed from full to halfway on the solution .	1
My oldest son used my old Braun shaver since I upgraded . He loves it and this cleaning system allows for all the blades to be cleaned and ready to go again and again . Note my son only shaves once a week , he is only 15 ... .	1
I received a Braun shaver for Xmas last year and looked around for refills to keep the shaver clean . We even thought of refilling ourselves but after the first try , this was not the ideal solution to using the refills . We found these at Walmart for a good price but then when those refills were almost gone , I searched for a better price . The Amazon automatic supply system for refilling these ended up being the best price anywhere and , with free shipping and scheduled shipments , this is one less thing we have to concern ourselves with . Great product -- excellent value .	1
I buy these and often . I always clean my braun grazer and this is a must have . I do n't want itchy face because I did n't keep my razor clean .	1
I have been very pleased with my Braun shaver but not with the expense of the refills that are used with the cleaning and recharging station . Have tried several of the alternatives that I have googled , but none are as effective as the Braun refills . Came across the 3 pack on amazon.com at a price that made the need to try and jerry rig something that was n't as effective as the original unpractical . Great price and a true value thanks !	1
This is a pretty straightforward item . Although it does n't last quite as long as it should ( with the price I paid for my shaver ) , the product itself and ease of installation is excellent .	1
Decent product , a little expensive , the alcohol liquid does evaporate so one has to replace these on a regular basis . But a decent product for the price .	1
I 've had my Braun self-clean shaver for years . These cartridges last a month ( each ) and with Subscribe & Save I do n't even have to remember to order them .	1
Easy to install and replace . Seems to last only so long . Requires replacing a lot more often than I expected.Guess I 'm just used to manually removing the hairs instead of some fancy auto cleaning system . I tried to do that but it was n't coming apart for me so its a requirement with this electric shaver.A lot of hair builds up in the bottom and because really dirt once used up . So it works as advertised .	1
I 'm rating this 5 stars because it works great . I 'm like many people that try to use their Braun cleaner fiuld for too long . I 've added water and rubbing alochol , but it just does n't feel as good when cleaned . I stocked up on these from Amazon to always have freash cleaning fluid in the house . I do n't pay sales tax and shipping is FREE when purchasing items over $ 25 combined . If you want to keep your Braun razor in great shape and get a clean , smooth and fresh shave , get this and change timely .	1
Only for Braun electric razors- lasts about a month ( in my case anyway - several years `` observation too . ) The `` unit '' lets you know ( wait for the RED light ! ) when to do it too .	1
This product has been around for years , and works with the Braun auto-clean razors . They leave the razor clean , fresh smelling , and ready to use . I do wish they would last longer and that there were some way to recycle them .	1
It does what it 's supposed to do - clean and sanitize my Braun razor . One refill seems to last 2 months . And that 's shaving about 6 days a week . I do n't really know how it works , but it does .	1
He has n't had to use these yet but said they 're a great idea . He 's very happy with them . It 's easier to have these on hand instead of waiting when to order them when they need it .	1
Good and pretty and nice with price.It 's worth to buy and I recommend it.Thanks and buy it for yourself .	1
This is one of my favorite things about the Braun series 7 . Those drain quite fast if you do n't close the lid on the top , so DO NOT THROW IT AWAY ! If you close the lid often , this should last you around a month or so , since the alcohol does n't evaporate !	1
Now that Amazon has lowered the price to less than $ 4 each , this is a very good deal . Better than you can get at Target , Walmart , etc.I think these refills make the Braun Syncro shaving system the best out there . Nothing like a fresh , lemony , sanitary shave every morning . I have noticed an improvement in my complexion since going to this system.So far my refills have been lasting 5-6 weeks each , which helps to increase the value and lower the cost .	1
This product keep my braun clean and ready to go ! Easy to use and mess free ! So go ahead and try it !	1
This is the same you will get in the store . Only a better price and you do n't have to deal with going to the store . Win win	1
The price is good and it is very convenient not to have search all over some store to find them when needed .	1
I have started ordering the Braun Clean & Renew Cartridge Refills through Amazon since it is easier and cheaper than buying at most drugstores . This package comes with 4 of the cartridge refills so you want have to worry about running low .	1
These products help maintain your razor running at peak level . You will notice a closer and better shave using this product .	1
Product works as I expected , and the price for four of these is way better than you can get in the supermarket .	1
it 's pricey but what options do you really have ? my razor always seems clean and it smells fresh , so boom .	1
Have had a Braun for many years now and would typically buy the 2 pack boxes at the local store . Found these on-line and could n't be happier . Having a bunch of extras is perfect for that time when your cleaner light turns red and you need that thing cleaned for tomorrow ...	1
I have been using this product for close to a year now with my Braun electric razor . The product works very well in cleaning and refreshing my razor . I use it after every shave . It has helped keep my razor sharp and non greasy . I like the fact it is n't loaded with a bunch of toxic ingredients yet it gets the facial hair and grease out perfectly . The product lasts over 30 days for me . It also has a pleasant fragrance so when you use your razor again it has a nice fresh clean and not overbearing fragrance to it . This product will help my razor last a very long time . The price was good . The product arrived two days before estimated delivery date in perfect condition . It was packed in a Braun package so they ust have just grabbed it off the shelf and sealed and shipped it . All in all the price was good . I love the subscription option . It saves you a nice amount of change over time .	1
Great concept , though a little pricey . Necessary evil if you have a Braun razor using the clean and renew system .	1
You ca n't beat these , they work well and clean your razor for you . I enjoy the citrus scent it leaves behind , or at least I think it is citrus . They are a bit on the pricey side , but what are you going to do . The razor offers to great a shave to ditch it because the cost of a cleaning cartridgeA good secret to make this thing last long is buy a cheap bottle of alcohol at a pharmacy , cvs sells it for a dollar . If you want buy some witch hazel as well , its about the same cost . Pour the alcohol in the cartridge and if you want add a touch of witch hazel for the smell . It works great , I do it all the time and have owned the same razor for 4 years . Its saves me a ton money especially during the summer months when the solvent pretty much just evaporates at 4 times the speed . Just keep an eye on the hair build in the cartrigde , you can work a cartridge for 3 times its normal life . More if you empty the hair out before cleaning it .	1
I buy these on Amazon because they cost less than they do at any of the large local stores . I shave every other day and set the razor to clean after every shave and I find these last quite a while , long enought that I can not reall the last time I put one in , it must have been about two months ago , it is showing the low level light now . Given this usage I think I go through about three packs a year , not bad to have a nice shave when I want and keep the blad running smooth .	1
Those of us who shave have to `` face '' it ... . shavers and razors all have repeated costs . A normal razor requires new blades , shaving cream , and after-shave ( sometimes pre-shave ) . People have gotten used to the idea that electric shavers should have fewer consumables ( especially given the cost ) . However , electric shavers have greatly improved in recent years , and the new Brauns are about the greatest shavers on the market today . Part of the way they achieve such a close cut is that they do not `` gunk up '' with skin cells and oil the way other shavers do . I guess you could clean another shaver daily , but the Clean and Renew is about the best way I have seen to maintain a consistently close shave . I accept the monthly cost of these cartridges the way one would buy shaving cream , shampoo , or any other toiletry . They do a nice job and smell quite pleasant . Only issue is that the smell is not designed to go right on your face . If you remove the shaver mid-cycle and try to use it , it is not a pleasant experience . But one the liquid dries , the shaver has a pleasant aroma . Recommended !	1
The cartridges work perfectly and having four gives me a reserve supply - I never remember to reorder until one runs dry . But the cover flaps are difficult to open and I generally splash some on the sink.I am very happy with the job that the cartridges do .	1
I 've used Braun shavers for donkey 's years ever since I got one for Christmas years ago . I wo n't ever go back to a blade even if it does shave more closely , I just ca n't stand to think that I 'm just a sneeze away from a free face peel.Before Braun came up with this cash cow I was cleaning my Braun with a toothbrush every 2-3 shaves . I still do that about once a month because even though the fluid cleans the cutting blade you still get hair detritus left behind in cracks , outside of the foil assembly and even around the two screws under the cutting block and other places . So once in a while , I 'll get out my trusty toothbrush again and give the whole shaver a thorough cleaning over.This fluid is not cheap so I try to prolong the life span of it by `` pre-cleaning '' my shaver . I always open up the shaver and tap away the loose hair cuttings after every shave . This way , the cleaner fluid stays cleaner longer . And everyone is right , I do n't think there 's any way of preventing the fluid from evaporating , LOL , I think Braun made sure of that . Just make sure you do n't park your cleaner in a hot area.Taking the advice of some the other reviewers , when I 'm done with the cleaning , I remove the cleaning fluid and cap it to prevent further evaporation . The instructions say the fluid should normally last 1 month . By removing the cleaning fluid and capping it , I 'm able to have it last 6 weeks even with cleaning the shaver after every use . But I would not recommend using it longer than that because dead bacteria and other things I 'd rather not think about is going to remain in the cleaner fluid reservoir , and the cleaner fluid gets more concentrated and dirty . As another reviewer says , it 's about $ 5 per month , which is not bad to have your shaver smelling good and clean . And it 's certainly good for Braun !	1
I think I have my subscribe and save set to 6 months which is perfect . It seems once I load the last cartridge I 'm getting an email from amazon telling me the next set is on its way . Its cheaper this way and less hastle.As for the product , its exactly what you need if you have a Clean and Renew razor . There really is nothing else to say about that .	1
I have this razor , and love it and the cleaning system . But does Amazon take us for fools ? They are selling this three-pack for more per unit ( $ 4.33 per ) than the two-pack ( $ 3.99 per ) . Hopefully they 'll lower this price instead of raising the other one ...	1
Getting these in the mail for this price was so much better than running around in Wal Mart trying to get someone to open the case and get one out for me .	1
Great product for keeping the shaver clean ! It 's easy to use and i do recommend using it . I 'm glad its easy to buy on Amazon .	1
I love purchasing these little packets to keep my Braun Contour shaver clean and maintenance-free . I replace the refill packet every two months or so .	1
Cleaned my shaver just as described . Great price . Too bad we ca n't get Obama and his kind to do as they promised .	1
i love Braun Syncro Shaver System Clean & Renew Refills and fit as expected.very good.i love it so much.i love braun 's .	1
My husband is pleased with the refills -- they work well . He really likes the razor -- very much !	1
I have been using these now for almost 10 years . Every now and then I will go 2 months without buying more because of the price . Let me tell you from experience that they do increase the shavers ability to shave closer and faster . I think it must have something to do with the lubrication it provides the blades and internals of the shaving head . For the best price though , buying them from Amazon and using subscribe and save 9on the 3 pack0 will get you the best price available . So if you do n't mind taking more time and working a bit more to get every hair and make it really close you can do without these ( but you still MUST open the head and clean the whiskers out every now and then ) or just spend the few bucks through S & S like I mentioned and have a quick easy close shave .	1
just one of those everyday things that Amazon makes so much easier to keep up with . Works great , comes on a regular basis so I remember to take good care of the razor	1
OEM refills for Braun Cleaner / Charger . They do a good job of keeping my razor clean , I usually clean it once a week . Ca n't beat the price and convenience using Subscribe & Save . Highly recommended ! Lasts a long time !	1
So these are a must have for the super smart man that saved up and got the best shaver in the world.Do we have to take a major hit on the wallet ? Maybe . What 's a Fiver in costs every 6-10 weeks , huh ? I think I can swing it this year , but if hard times come and that kid gets re elected , if the greedy NYC & DC folk keep making gas & utilities costs higher , and we get hammered even worse -- Then I heard you can refill these with 2-5 drops of lemon juice and a top off with cheap pharmacy isotropic rubbing alcohol to save a spot of cash . Manually clean and mechanically clean on alternating days or weeks if you want to be a frugal type . Consult youTube in a big way for tips on this ... It 's important to not dispose of the cap , recap after cleaning cycles , and avoid evaporation or fast waste of the product.Do what I say , and you will stretch your cash from a 30 day reload to a 60-180 day reload .	1
It 's exactly what i had when i bought the product . Works great and cleans my razor just right . Very happy with the purchase .	1
I ordered 6 of these , and the 1st one installed very easily . The whole unit seems well designed , and I only run the cleaner when it requires total cleaning .	1
Love the bulk pricing . Perfect replacement . Cheaper than buying locally with sales tax and more $ $ per unit	1
My husband loves the razor this refill goes with . Refill does an excellent job cleaning the razor each day . When we travel we send one of the refills ahead of us so my hubby can use the razor . The cost of these refills is well worth the cleanliness they give to the razor .	1
I have owned the Braun Syncro for over two years now and I still love it as much as the day I bought it . The Clean & Renew cartridges are wonderfully convenient as they both clean and lubricate the shaver head in one step ( the residual lubricant can be felt if you run your finger over the shaver head after each cleaning ) . The cleaning also leaves a fresh lemon scent.Now , the convenience comes at a price . The price of the Clean & Renew cartridges is definitely a concern for a lot of people , including myself . There are , however , a few things you can do to economize : ( 1 ) remove the cartridge and cap it after each cleaning to prevent the loss of the highly volatile alcohol component , or ( 2 ) if that 's too much of a hassle , top of the cartridge with 91-99 % isopropyl alcohol when the fluid runs low . ( 3 ) do n't run the shaver through the cleaning cycle after *every* shave ; do it only after several shaves ( note : Braun advises that the cartridge be replaced after 30 cleaning cycles or 6-8 weeks WCF ) . ( 4 ) if you 're really strapped for cash , you always have the option of cleaning the shaver head under running tap water ! Just remember to lube the shaver head periodically with amachine oil.I absolute love these Clean & Renew cartridges ! They will help to keep your Braun Synchro at its optimal performance to give you a shave that 's just about as close as one you get from a blade !	1
My husband ordered this when he ordered his second Braun shaver , the Series 7-790cc . He says it easy-to-use and does a good job keeping the shaver in good shape ( important since it does double duty , he shares the shaver with our teenaged son ) . Recommended .	1
There is n't a whole lot to say about these . I do n't think there is any other type of refill you can get for your Braun razor cleaner/charger . I have never had an issue with these . They come in a cardboard box and not much other packaging . Very convenient .	1
Smells nice and fresh and keeps the razor clean . Easy to install . Fits and works as good as the original .	1
You need this refill Cartridge to keep your Braun shaver going and keep it clean for you . I will recommend anyone to try .	1
I have the Braun 8585 razor ; see my review there for my thoughts on that.I do love the cleaning fluid despite what I think about the razor . It works great - I 've opened the razor after a cleaning cycle and the inside is spotless . The smell is pleasant too.Best of all , it lasts . One cartridge lasts me 3 months . I only clean my razor when the `` normal '' light is on , or every 2-3 shaves . The cost to clean my razor works out to less than $ 20/year . That 's a bargain to me . No more brushes or hot running water ! Now if only the razor did a better job ...	1
I bought my Braun razor with the full expectation of having to shell out some extra cash on the cleaning cartridge refills every once in a while . I like the cleaning function and I use the cleaning function after every shave . It 's a great shaving system and I 've been very happy with it so I do n't see a reason for messing with it to save a few bucks by trying to make my own cleaning solution . The few times I 've had to clean the razor with water ( i.e . I was travelling ) I noticed that my shave was n't as close and smooth as when I used the cleaning system.I do clean as much hair from the razor before docking it to clean it in the hopes that the solution will last longer . I 'm also going to consider resealing the cartridge between shaves since evaporation is a very big problem in reducing the life of the cartridges ( thanks to other reviewers for suggesting that ) .	1
These cleaner cells keep the razor lubricated , from jamming between razor head change-outs , and are the best price i have found for them anywhere .	1
What could more convenient and economical than getting a pack of three Braun clean and renew refills every three months at a terrific price.No other retail store can match this deal.I clean my Braun razor daily and it is a pleasure to start the day using a clean and well lubricated shaver .	1
Get one of these , then get some 90 % isopropyl alcohol from your pharmacy for pennies , then keep refilling it . Of course , you should not follow my advice since it is against what Braun recommends , so please ignore my silly suggestion . It appears that my shavers never read Braun 's warnings because they just keep getting clean , keep smelling good , and keep working despite my illegal activities .	1

Having switched from a long time Braun user to a Norelco Sensotouch 3D I still have my 790cc Braun . When P & G ; bought out Braun they discontinued the foil and cutter block with a generic that pales in comparison to Braun Optifoil . I switched to the Norelco and the cleaning system system is a marvel.However I still prefer my old Braun and was lucky enough to have bought extra foils prior to them being phased out . The Braun clean and renew system is still in my opinion the best there is . The solution strips the blades and foil of all gunk , oils and whiskers - it 's like a brand new razor every morning.This is a great deal on a 4 pack of refills . Plus if you have a Prime membership you get Free two day shippin to boot . The frustration free packaging is a real plus and cuts down on waste - I choose it whenever it 's available .	1
I have the Braun 9595 ( my first `` real electric razor '' ) . At first I was a little bummed out that I 'd have to spend $ 15 on these `` refills '' that I would probably need every few weeks . Well , I was wrong on my assumptions to say the least ! 1 . The shaver gets super clean and smells great after a cleaning session.2 . The cleaning solution also lubricates the shaver thus increasing life.3 . The solution lasts about 2x as long as I thought it would.I started using the shaver around March 7 . I shave 2 times a day thanks to a super heavy beard that grows super fast . I have a 6 oclock shadow at 10:00am ... So , I tried to use the cleaning solution once a day but ended up using it twice a day ( I shave in the morning and at night ) . Just today ( April 9 2008 ) the low light came on . That means 1 cleaning cartridge lasts a little over a month with 2 cleanings per day for me.One thing I do that may help the life is after every single shave I take off the head - blow out the shaver and put the head under the faucet for 2-3 seconds . I know , why do this when you have a dedicated cleaning system , right ? Well , for a $ 220 shaver , I 'll do whatever I want . lol . Washing out the shaver head may have extended the life of the solution - I 've seen this in other reviews as well.Sign up for the subscription and the price will go down 15 % . I set it to 3 months ( about when I 'll need more refills ) . Compare that to buying razor blades every month for $ 20 and shaving cream every few months - this is a savings .	1
The product appears to be correct but the box is different on the two boxes I ordered . They are both the same part number . When the order quantity of an item is two or more , the warehouse should make sure the delivered product looks identical . I would never buy the same item with different packages at a local store , and Amazon should be more careful when pulling orders because this practice causes doubt that the product is identical . I have had this same result on other Amazon shipments where the quantity of an item was more than one . Old vs. new stock packages are often different . Some manufacturers even totally change the product while keeping the part number the same ( no revision letter change ) .	1
Guys if you have a thick beard that is prone ingrown hairs , this product may be your solution . By cleaning and lubricating my Braun shaver with this solution , I have significantly reduced painful razor bumps . While the shave is n't as close as premium blades , the loss of pain is well worth the shortcoming.Two tips : 1 ) I recommend cleaning the hair particles out of the shaver manually so as to get the most out of the solution . Occasionally , I will even clean the foil and block with ethyl alcohol before placing the saving2 ) Prevent evaporation -- consistently leaving the saver in the stand will help preserve the volatile solution more effectively . If you live in an extremely arid climate and are extremely frugal , covering the whole stand with 2 gallon zip lock bag might help .	1
Love the razor and these refills do the trick . The price is right and I 'll buy these again . I avoid non-OEMs or generic refills .	1
There is nothing like the smell and feel of a newly cleaned electric razor . I know they say to clean it when the yellow light comes on but this happens every 3 days . I do not like leaving the whole unit out so I take the cleaning base out every Sunday , once a week.the solution does a very good job of cleaning it and it smells fresh on the next shave . I only use it once a week and the solution lasts longer , it does not evaporate . I estimate this 4 pack will last about one year .	1
This is the only type of refill that works with my Braun shaver . I found the best price and bought accordingly .	1
This product does a good job of cleaning razor . Product is over priced in general and use every other cleaning . Other times just clean head in water .	1
If you search around , you can find the best price when you buy these in bulk . These work great with the Braun Shaver system ... and you 've got to have them ... so buy a pack at the best price ! I found them on Amazon at different prices ( and the best price was here with free shipping and no tax ) ... but I 've also found them elsewhere on the web for less at other times ... check before you buy !	1
Great deal and great packaging . After each use , I make sure to seal up the cartridge and keep it separate from the cleaning unit . This avoids the evaporation problem and they last longer . Only take a few seconds to do this each time and I only use the cleaning unit about every 10 shaves anyways .	1
It 's good to be able to get this product in bulk to help reduce the cost.Since this is made by a Braun approved source in Ireland you be sureit wo n't harm your razor .	1
Easy-to-use and keeps my series 7 Braun in tip top condition . Take good care of my series 7 . Help save on your investment	1
YOU CAN THREE FOR LESS THAN THE PRICE OF TWO . KEEP YOUR SHAVER CLEAN AND OILED . SMELL GREAT TOO .	1
I like the fresh smell and clean feel the Braun refills provide . I wish they would not evaporate so fast . I have noticed that when I return the razor to the cleaner each time , it lasts longer than if I leave the razor out .	1
Great for your Braun Clean and Renew Shaver . A must have if you have this shaver . Great that it comes in a four pack	1
This is a very sanitary shaving system . I have used these for 6 years . I used to get nasty ingrown hairs that would get infected , this has helped significantly . If you have the same problem , try not to touch your face with your hands immediately after shaving , that with Braun shavers has made a big difference for me . Extend the life by recapping them and storing them outside your charger .	1
I hate having to buy these , because you are essentially paying for a piece of filter material and some alcohol . Still , once your shaver goes through the cleaning cycle , it comes out feeling brand new , and shaves like new as well . The liquid contains a lemon scent and some lubricant for the razor , and the end result is almost worth the high price.To get a better deal , use the Amazon subscribe and save option , I get mine shipped every 6 months , and save 15 % .	1
I buy this product with the 'Subscribe & Save ' Amazon feature . It beats going to the store and having someone unlock a case where this product is stored . And , I save money too .	1
Excellent product and good price . Bought for my husband who uses this system and he loves the cleaning system . Good buy .	1
These go on sale from time to time , you can save quite a bit if you buy them in bulk when they 're on sale .	1
Though one can do it yourself with some Rubbing Alcohol , and scent/lubricant packs , the price is fair enough . I took a look at the 4 pack and it 's less costly than the break down of either the 12 pack or 6 pack shown on Amazon , so I bought 3 packs of the 4 refills , and saved a fair amount .	1
These cartridges are easy to use and they keep my razor clean and smelling fresh ; buying the cartridges this way reduces considerably the amount of packaging	1
The big difference about buying the refills at Amazon is that I save a lot of money . So if you have a Braun clean and rinse cartridge shaver you 'd be very smart to purchase them in the four count box from Amazon !	1
I have used this product for years . I do n't have a heavy beard , and sometimes I shave in the shower , so I usually do n't clean my shaver with this product more than once or twice a week and it works fine . I can definitely feel the difference after my shaver has been cleaned using this product.I agree that using this product is not inexpensive over time , but to me this is just a cost of maintenance ( like periodically changing the oil in my car ) . Also , if my shaver has had heavy use without using this product ( like when I go away on vacation for a week ) , I use a brush to clean out the shaver before using this product .	1
I use the Amazon Subscribe and Save for these Clean & Renew refills . With the S & S ; discount , the price is about $ 3 cheaper per refill than the local stores.In terms of needing these , well , I 've yet to take my shaver on a trip of a week or so and not have it tell me to clean it after 4 shaves . This is with running water over the blade and grill.I shave every other day and clean the shaver every time , as long as I 'm home . Every time I pick it up , at home , it does as good a job as it did when I first bought it . When I travel and do n't clean it so the light goes out , the shave takes much longer and is n't as close.So you save money in the long run going electric , until they figure out ways to ensure you still have to buy something from them , much the way the replaceable blade shavers do . If you can get over that and want to have a close shave , as close as it can get to the brand new feeling , then purchase these . I recommend the subscribe and save option as well , and just put it on a 6 month schedule . That 's how mine is set and using the clean function every shave ( every other day ) , the cartridges seem to last about 6 weeks or more .	1
Sure , one could mix up some mineral oil , alcohol , and water and it 'd probably work , but this is convenient and it works so well with the Braun cleaner that I 'm sold on it . I use the periodic shipment from Amazon to save money and make sure I always have some on hand . If you like a clean razor , this is a good product to use .	1
The ability to buy these in a three pack with free shipping is a great deal . You do n't have any choice if you have the Braun razor that uses these , but this sure makes it convenient and a fair price .	1
This is probably one of the best improvement for maintaining ones electric shaver . I have mine now for more than 5 years cleaning it with the solution and together with replacing the cutter block every 12-18 months ( depending on how much facial hair it cuts ) , my shaver is still working like it is brand new . I do n't need to clean the shaver every day . I clean it once a week and it is good to go .	1
They work as designed . They are a better buy here than at wallmart.I need seven more stupid words to finish this .	1
I have been using these for several years now . I wish they would last longer than they do for there is a bit that evaporates over time . But , it does a nice job cleaning the shaver . It is recommended to NOT refill these with alcohol , although i often check these and when they are around 2/3 's full , i will add some alcohol and fill it back up . I do it only the one time and this makes them go further.I did that once when the unit was about 1/4 full ... and it actually made it more difficult to get my shaver clean . However , at 2/3 's full or 3/4 's full ... and then adding some alcohol ... that works well and i get an extra 2 week'ish.Thanks .	1
Each cartridge lasts a little longer than a month and is necessary to keep the foil and blades clean and sharp for a first-class shave every morning .	1
These are the same ones I have to pay about $ 12 for at Wal-Mart . If you use these a lot like I do , it 's the best value .	1
One pack will last you a year if you close it back up after use and only clean once or twice a week.I ca n't see leaving the lid open 24/7 as the thing would evaporate and the clean cycle only takes about 5 or 6 minutes to run .	1
The Braun cartridge refills keep my shaver clean and lubricated , without me having to do a thing . Just shave and then put your shaver in the Braun cleaning device and let the cleaner do the rest . The cartridges do get a bit pricey though , so I would suggest shopping around for the best price .	1
Not much that I can say other than the price of these is much better on Amazon so I get them here . The product works great and keeps my razor in top condition . The only thing I have noticed is that once a razor is a few years old I think the product starts to wear the painting / coating on the plastic . Mine razor has started to discolor a little as well as bubble / peel near the area the cleaner hits . Really this is a non-issue , most razors I have had that cost well over $ 200 dont even seem to last that long , just figured I would mention it . Not much you can do really , you have to clean the razors and these cartridges are what most require in some form .	1
What a wonderful product ! No more cleaning my razor by hand , and no more razor burn ! I 'm so glad my wife bought the Braun razor with the self cleaning station for me last year for Fathers Day . I 've never had it so good : - ) I do n't have dense beard growth , but I still have to shave once a day , so the cartridges last me a long time . I 've used two since Fathers Day , for what 's that 's worth .	1
My husband loves his Braun shaver and these refills clean the shaver spotless . It 's the only way to look acceptable without having to use the wet shaver every morning for him .	1
I love this cleaning system , it works well and seems to be reliable . Subscribing on the refills makes the price even better .	1
this is a must if you have the braun razor , I like this better then the one that comes with the shaver . this stuff has a nice lemony smell to it	1
A very pleasant scent and it works quite well at cleaning my Braun razor . So far , the razor has lasted me five years of daily use . Quite impressive . The only thing I will mention is that this is composed primarily of alcohol and it does evaporate . I do n't clean my razor everyday but probably should because I am not saving much when one considers the evaporation .	1
I usually refill my own with a combiation of rubbing alcohol and witch hazel but at around $ 3 each this was a no brainer .	1
I finally found this at a better price than I could have at the local wal mart . I do try to stretch it out with one or two doses of rubbing alcohol .	1
I am not a daily shaver so I only replace the refills every 8-9 weeks . Even after that period of time , there is still 1/3 of the liquids left but for hygienic reasons you would probably want to change the refill anyway . I think the refills are reasonably priced and keeps the blades all clean for the next round .	1
What is there to not like . Good price and clean lubricated razer . It would not let me just tell my opinion without adding more words	1
The Braun Clean & Renew system is a great way to rejuvenate your electric razor , especially given that my last razor had a tendency to be hard to clean by hand . The problem with owning a Clean & Renew ( or `` Clean & Charge '' ) system is that refills like this cost yet more money for a razor you already bought the Clean & Charge system for , and for which you also know that you 'll be buying blades and foils.Here then are the best ways to save money when you 're buying Clean & Renew refills : - This product can be bought two ways : as a pack of three or a pack of two . The price of each changes from time to time . When you need to buy more , take a moment 's basic math to figure out the best price per unit . Sometimes the per-unit price of three is a better deal than the price for just two , and vice versa.- You do n't need to use this system every day , or even every week . I bought my system from a Braun store that also did repairs and the owner ( who also owned a 7526 like mine ) told me he uses the cleaner every two weeks . He also said ... - When using your Braun razor daily , take 10 seconds when you 're done and run it with the foil clicked loose ( but still attached ) . The blade inside will shake like a wet dog and drop loose particles into your trash or sink ... meaning less build-up when you go to put it in the clean and charge ... and the fluild lasts longer- When you 're not using the clean & charge system , pop open the Clean & Charge base , slide out the Clean & Renew refill , and put the cap back on it . This will keep the alcohol from evaporating and the fluid will last longer.- This product is often eligible for free Super Saver shipping if you buy more than $ 25 . Either buy two three-packs and get free shipping , or buy these when you need to buy a blade and/or foil replacement ( which are also often eligible for free Super Saver Shipping ) . It does n't make sense to pay $ 5 to ship a $ 10 or $ 15 item . I typically buy a set of these when I 'm on my last one , and usually only when I happen to be buying something else that 'll push me over the limit and save me some money.I like the Braun Clean & Charge system , and my Braun 7526 . I do n't like being nickel-and-dimed on all the bits and pieces that keep it working as well as it does . With a little planning , I get the most bang for my buck out of these bundles .	1
I purchased my Bruan shaver with clean system about 8 years ago . I use to be able to go to Walmart and purchase the refills , but here lately Walmart has not had them in stock . So I had to go online to find them and of course Amazon did . Not only was the refills cheaper , but instead of getting a 2 refill pack I was able to get a 3 refill pack cheaper than what Walmart sold with only 2 in their package . I would highly recommend this product to anyone who own a Braun shaver with a cleaning system .	1
Not a bad value for this quantity . Beats having to run out to a store to find these especially in larger than a two pack .	1
Braun IRT 4520 Ear Thermometer is an excellent device for taking temperatures , especially in small children and infants . Most families have an oral thermometer and some use other types , like rectal or those that are placed under the armpit . These other thermometers are generally ok with certain age groups but when it comes to the very young , an ear thermometer is the best option . And the Braun IRT 4520 is one of the best on the market.This thermometer gives accurate results in about 30 to 45 seconds . They way it accomplishes its task is by using infrared technology to measure the level of heat generated by the eardrum and other tissue . Some may question the ear as an accurate place to measure ones ' body temperature but according to many medical experts , the ear actually provides greater accuracy than oral and other types of thermometers.Of all the pluses with this device , the most important among them is the ease of use . Babies generally do n't like anything placed inside their ears but they do n't resist this type of thermometer like they do others . I had tried using the armpit style thermometer but the squirming and crying was too much . With this , there is still a little bit of annoyance for both your baby and you but it is nothing compared to the aggravation caused by other types of thermometers.On occasion , this thermometer may have a problem producing an accurate measurement and when it does , it will let you know on the display panel . For example , if the tip is n't inserted properly in the ear , you will get the error code `` POS '' , indicating that the positioning is not secure . If the surrounding air is too hot or too cold ( needs to be between 50 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit ) , you will get the `` Err '' error message . If a person 's temperature is far too high or too low , ( outside the 93.2 to 108 degrees Fahrenheit range ) you will get `` HI '' or `` LO '' . If this happens , do n't panic- chances are you did n't insert the thermometer correctly or the filter is n't clean . Replace the filter if necessary and try again.One of the many nice things about this device is that it comes complete with batteries . This may not seem like a big deal but it is no fun when you buy a new electronic device , race home , and discover you forgot the batteries . Braun knows that when people buy a thermometer , it is usually because they need to use it immediately . They do n't want the unexpected surprise of having no batteries . Braun includes these for your convenience . And the fact that the batteries are ordinary AA is also convenient because this type of battery is easy to find.Yet another plus with this thermometer is that it stores the last temperature in memory . This temperature will display when you turn the unit on , allowing you to see the last reading and compare it to the reading you are about to take . This is nice because it takes the guesswork out of the task . Often , a pediatrician will ask if you know the previous temperature so that he/she can make comparisons and check progress in the case of illness . With this device , it is right there , on the panel when you turn it on . And when you take a new temperature , the reading remains on the screen for sixty seconds for your convenience.Could this thermometer be improved in any way ? Well , I can only think of a few minor things . One would be a gripping surface- perhaps a small section around the middle with a rubber covering to help consumers hold the device more firmly in place . Another possible improvement would be a lighted display panel , just in case you need to use the thermometer in a dark place . These and other changes could make the thermometer even more appealing , but they are minor and should n't count for much in a buying decision.To keep things as sanitary as possible , it is important to always replace the lens filter before each use . This is a small plastic cap that fits over the tip of the measuring device and it needs to be replaced after each use . These replacement filters can be purchased in most drug stores and on- line at a cost of less then ten dollars for a pack of forty . This is an added cost for owning this type of thermometer . But any type of thermometer is going to include its share of cleaning/sanitation costs so , again , this should n't have too much affect on one 's decision to buy.Overall , this thermometer has proven itself a godsend for me and my family . The ease of use , the memory storage of the last temperature reading , and the long battery life ( about two years or 1000 measurements ) make this a must have for anyone with babies or toddlers . It eliminates much of the fussiness and frustration common with other thermometers and even though it carries a hefty price tag , it is worth the extra cost .	1
My wife purchased this digital thermometer after pouring herself over hours of research and reading . Being an audiophile and a Registered Nurse , she 's one of those people that reads the manual on everything first , never makes an impulse purchase and often times calls the company directly via the phone numbers listed on the packaging ( which she usually copies down in the store ) .I had purchased a different thermometer for her as birthday present , but that 's a whole other story . Needless to say the Braun Thermoscan Thermometer was her preferred choice . The reasons are thus:1.The readings this device give are the most accurate for any ear thermometer on the market at any price . This should be the most important reason - all - the time.2.The sterile caps are a necessity and even if you 're only using the device on one child you should do everything in your power to cut down on ear infections.3.The reading it takes occurs very quickly.4.The beep is more for me than it is for her , which she thinks is a must . Removing the device early is a common mistake.5.The 'ease of use ' makes taking an ear reading a simple matter . Easier than oral , rectal or armpit and a world of difference over the newer Temporal Thermometers.6.The storage of 1000 readings which is a blessing when you have to look back at the data , and some of us do.My son likes this thing so much he quickly figured out how to stick it in his own ear a few times and press the button and wait for the beep , which caused my wife to scowl and panic , but of course I just thought my son was gifted like all foolish parents out there.The cost of the small plastic filters is incredibly minimal as is the actual cost of the device itself . Sure , you can go to Target or Wal-Maze and buy yourself another cheapie , but then you 'll be back exactly where you are now sometime later ... looking for a dependable and accurate ear Thermometer.This is currently the best ... . ...	1
These fit myBraun Thermoscan Ear Thermometer with ExacTemp Technologyperfectly . The box of 20 fits right in the case for storage .	1
I like using these filters on my thermometer . They are extremely easy to use and dispose of properly . I would recommend them	1
The Thermoscan brand filters come in a little box that fits into my Thermoscan case . It 's so easy and convenient to use . The filters fit my Thermoscan with ease . I have no problems .	1
Works well . Great price ! keeps it sanitary and helps to give accurate readings . Everywhere else you get it at , you will pay at least double what you would pay here .	1
I USE THE BRAUN LENS FILTERS FOR MY EAR THERMOMETER.REPLACING EACH TIME WE USE THE EAR THERMOMETER.A GREAT BUY .	1
I used to stay in hotels 4 nights of the week when working out of town . Nothing worse for good sleep than noise , a strange place , and jetlag . If you get a smoking room or a stale-smelling room , it can be really be pretty bad . I used to put the television on a non-channel for the white noise ( blocks traffic , elevators and voices a bit ) and burn scented candles for the odors.The Homedics device is a lot better than burning a candle and having the TV on all night . I love the woodlands sounds and aromatherapy sure works for me ( and certainly gets rid of that & quot ; hotel & quot ; smell as well . ) If you travel or know someone who has to be on the road , this is a great thing to take with . And if you have a fussy baby , sometimes it can help ( although I lent one recently to a friend with a colicky kid but he still preferred to be in a car , driven round and round and round and ... . )	1
used it and finally wore it out a few years later and just lately threw it awaw . turns itself off	1
I bought this based on other user 's reviews and I am not unhappy . This is a little noisy in the aroma mode but using the combo of aroma and ocean waves puts me out before the 60 minute timer shuts the unit off . It works !	1
Of all the other over the counter remedies , I find Aleve the most effective pain treatment for my arthritic knees .	1
I was amazed at how little I paid for this quantity . If you have arthritis , and you need an anti inflammatory , this is the one to buy .	1
I get some monster migraines at times and this is the only thing that seems to work the best and the fastest . They work every time and within half an hour of taking it .	1
Aleve is a good for pain and I was told it is not a blood thinner . Very good buy and good service .	1
Works almost as well as the commercial says it does . I discovered that taking 2 at bedtime instead of one every 12 hours worked the best for me .	1
Had tried the bottle of 100 and it worked so I bought some more and this is okay so far .	1
I take Aleve twice per day . When I see my supply dwindling , I order more . Save money on the product , gas , and time .	1
A great meta-analysis found this to be of less cardiovascular risk than any other NSAID , either prescription , or non . While not without gastrointestinal risks , etc. , a small amount of this over-the-counter , high quality product will relieve pain for many hours . It may also be risky and may cause kidney problems if used over the long term.There appears to be little risk associated with short term risk if you follow the label directions . Be sure to read the ENTIRE label and follow the directions carefully , and discuss any risks that you might have with your qualified medical professional.With long term use you should always follow up with your primary care provider who can prescribe medical blood tests to check for any problems that could develop : This is why this product comes in two strengths and one of them is prescription only.Many pharmacists have recommended this to patients , telling them that this is the most effective over the counter pain reliever as well . While this information should not substitute for professional medical advice , this is a product that I keep on my shelf and use according to label directions.I like that it is made in Germany , and the tablets seem to be of very high quality . I only trust Bayer brand , and I am certainly willing to pay a little more for the best product available in terms of quality , safety , and perceived very high quality assurance standards .	1
The pricing on this was very good . I will be purchasing this again in the future . Thanks for the good deal .	1
great price you get 270 for about the same price that you would pay for 90 if you bought three of the 30 per bottle .	1
I get much more relief from this product and have it on hand all the time . I do n't need it often andthis price was so unreal-I have paid more for a bottle of 100 at my drug store .	1
Works great on my fibromyalgia and arthritis . I use it along with another pain med and together they really help me get through my days .	1
I basically refuse to take Acetaminophen whenever possible due to the health risks , so this is a great alternative to that for mild pain relief ( headaches , etc ) .It 's non-prescription , and wo n't work as well as prescription , but for mild pain it does the job.And none of the health concerns as with Acetaminophen ! ! !	1
Works so well for cramps ! I used to take advil / ibuprfen ... my doctor would perscribe naproxen ... this is exactly what I was perscribed . So now , a day or so before I 'm expectng cramps ... or when cramps are there ... this just creates a good buffer to alleviate the discomfort ! Has also been good for alleviating joint pain !	1
I added this item to my monthly sub and save items . I am up to around 20 items now with some coming every month and some coming every four months like this item . The expiration date is two years out so I know I have received a good product . As far as price it is just a little cheaper than store bought but since I can not shop in stores very easily , extreme low vision , this fits the bill .	1
Somewhat effective pain killer .	1
I go to Aleve when I experience a sprained back . It usually works & helps me out , certainly more than aspirin .	1
I believe in this product , as well as my family , who all suffer with headaches . The price was excellent , pkg arrived quickly ... no complaints ! !	1
I chew one , sometimes two , at night before bed in the hopes that it will prevent a heart attack during the night . I read somewhere that the optimum time to take it is at 10 pm to prevent an attack in the wee hours .	1
I purchased these for my dad because he has to take them daily . I now use them myself because they work so well .	1
I love the taste of these chewable low-dose aspirin from Bayer . If you have difficulty swallowing pills and need to take a daily low-dose aspirin , these are for you ! Most of what you find in stores is orange flavored and I much prefer these cherry ones . Each box contains enough for a whole month plus a few extra ( yes , I have been known to drop one in the heater/air vent or even down the bathroom sink ) .	1
Bayer has good brand name recognition and makes quality products . This low dose aspirin is no exception . The cherry flavor is a nice alternative to orange .	1
If you 're on an aspirin regimen , like myself , then you 'll love these . It brings me back to my childhood and for something to do that its got to be good . Tastes great and you can tell they 're Bayer . Love em .	1
My husband has been told by his doctor to take a low dosage aspirin daily . You ca n't beat this price anywhere .	1
I have a standard collie . I give her this product when she hurts her leg or is under the weather . She weighs about 55 lbs . I sneak it in her food . You can tell she is better in about an hour . The pain is alleviated .	1
I use this for everything ; back pain , sore muscles , sprains , it works great on them all ! It does n't smell great , but not any worse than icy hot or something like that and you do n't have to get it all over your hands to apply it . It feels sort of cool when you put it on , but warms up a la icy hot after a bit ... but it really does help the soreness go away ! I carry it in my purse for those moments when my back acts up and I need instant relief- definitely a great buy !	1
The relief from pain in my feet and in my lower back comes after a few minutes of applying . It does has a medicine smell , but is not near as strong of a smell as most sports creams and ice/heat rubs . The 4 oz . bottle of Absorbine will last you a long time even with daily use . The defect I find is in the foam applicator , which causes too much to come out and run . I have to be careful when applying to my lower back or it easily can run down my buttcrack , which feels like hot lava .	1
This product is a great pain reliever and has a nice smell . No offensive to clients I work with . Helps me with the pain of water retention in the legs .	1
Being from Canada , I learned that this product was hard to come by in the USA pharmacies and was ordering it online through Amazon . Although this is not the 'extra strength ' product , if you have never use Absorbine Jr. before then what are you waiting for ? Once you have used this all natural product you will find yourself using nothing else . I have a lower back pain issue that flares up every once in a while and using Absorbine Jr. always helps subside the pain .	1
I did n't find that this worked very well for my arthritis ( osteo ) , but it DOES work wonderfully on mosquito bites , especially if you use it on the bites as soon as you notice them . To me , it 's worth it 's weight in gold for just that reason . I purchasedAbsorbine Jr Pain Relieving Liquid , Original , with No-Mess Applicator - 4 fl oz , then theAbsorbine Jr Pain Relieving Liquid , Original - 16 fl ozto refill the bottle . I will purchase again next summer when those pesky critters come back.My husband does n't like the smell , but I do n't mind it at all ... and I do n't care since it works ! : D	1
I loved this , it has wormwood that helps with fungus problems and other skin irritations . I used it in my youth 50 some years ago on a horse with saddle sores that would not heal . the next day healing has started ! ole time remedies made from real plants work when synthetics only cause another problem ! ! !	1
I bought this product today because it was recommended by my mother . I got a spider bite on my temple and it caused quite a bit of swelling . So much that I could n't wear my glasses because the head of the bit where the venom comes out was right where the band rides on my glasses . The bite was causing pain and the Absorbine Jr. has helped . It stings a bit on the wound but that is followed by relief and the relief lasted for a couple hours.My mom uses it for mosquito bites and says it 's really good stuff . I have to agree .	1
This came very quickly , which is always a perk for me . Does it work ? Yes ? It really helps sore , stiff muscles . When I have do n't to much , I rub it on . Better smell then be gay , but they both work . I like this form better myself , but that 's just me .	1
This is great for itches . Poison ivy and bites . But I ca n't find it in the store anymore . So happy to find it on Amazon . It relieves itching and dries up poison ivy .	1
Absorbine Jr. is one of best `` old fashioned '' , now , sadly little known products on market.I do use several `` legacy '' type products still including Absorbine Jr , Cornhusker 's LotionPfizer Consumer Healthcare Corn Huskers Lotion 7 Oz & Corn Huskers Heavy Duty Oil-Free Hand Treatment Lotion 7 fl oz ( 207 ml ) and Bag BalmBag Balm Antiseptic , 10 ozWhile not quite as effective on muscle aches to me as some other products like Icy Hot , it is still good and is fantastic on athlete 's foot problems ( burns like hades , but clears up mine in 2-3 days ) and works extremely well on insect bites and plant sticker punctures and irritations . Kids may howl and complain as it can BURN on broken skin / abrasions , but it works better than most of today 's fancy ( and expensive ) products and does not have an perfumes or fragrances added . It acts , works and SMELLS like a `` medicine '' .	1
Many years ago , but about this time of year , I was in the hospital . In addition to the reason that made me an inpatient , I had developed quite a red , itchy rash `` down there . '' The ( male ) nurse gave me a little dose-cup of cream and a wooden coffee stick and suggested I apply it to myself after showering . Recognizing the familiar smell and thickness of the cream as some version of Monistat , I asked , `` Why this ? I do n't have a vagina . '' The nurse , who was not easily shocked , replied `` Similar condition . Hot , wet , anaerobic ( oxygen-free ) . Just use it . `` I did , and it worked -- to a point . But why , I asked myself , had n't someone thought of taking one of the many athletic powders on the market and making Miconazole Nitrate ( as in Monistat ) its active ingredient ? That would combine a proven antifungal agent with the dryness and absorbent quality of an athletic powder . Several years later I was delighted to find this Zeabsorb type AF on drugstore shelves , and it has been a mainstay for my torrid zone every since.It 's a simple combination but it works well for me : the powder dries , and the Miconazole Nitrate fights fungus . It works great against my crotch rotch or any impending versions thereof . It also keeps my summer armpits from getting `` withery , '' if you should be annoyed by that condition . Since it is a fine enough powder to fight friction , it is refreshing and comfortable on the guy bits themselves , especially worn with summer cotton . Personally , it 's just okay on my feet , not much better than original Desenex or even Gold Bond green label , but for simplicity 's sake it has become my all-over , take-with powder . ( Note that it is marketed as a remedy against athlete 's foot . ) Be sure , when you buy this , to look for the wasp-waisted plastic bottle with the green strip in the middle ; other reviewers have stressed that similar-looking products do n't work as well . Not everyone will warm to the smell , which is basically locker-room medicinal , slightly sweet . Certainly it has the advantages of not smelling of kid stuff like baby powders , nor like menthol , but not SO macho people can smell you half a block away . `` Get me some of that s -- - that do n't stink , '' said Kevin Costner 's baseball player in the movie BULL DURHAM , and perhaps he had something like Zeabsorb in mind.Typically , Zeabsorb AF is not cheap , with a price at the premium end of mass-distribution powders . I ordered the two-pack for sale here at Amazon , for a savings of about 25 percent per bottle compared to my local Walmart , roughly 40 percent less than at Walgreen 's . The bottles were shrink-wrapped together , put in a clear protective bag , and then boxed with air bladders -- flawless . I am sorry some reviewers here had problems with different versions of Zeabsorb than they bargained for , or poor packaging ; hopefully those problems have been addressed . Certainly I am pleased with my experience . Also , thus far , this is NOT an add-on item , a plus with me.If you have n't tried Zeabsorb AF yet , I recommend it , but I do realize the choice of an antifungal powder like this is somewhat subjective . Personally , I know of no good substitute for the powder for personal use , and the price at Amazon as of now ca n't be beat . Five stars !	1
These is excellent powder and have come in very handy and was delivered on time as stated in very good shape with no defects .	1
I love to running , but do n't want a toenail infection or fungus . I use this between changing out my odor eaters especially in the summer and I have never had a problem .	1
Nice and absorbentDoes not smell badFeels nice on skin , nice as can use for any skin site on the nody	1
I worked at ups for many years , and wearing the same workboots everyday isnt so great when your feet sweat . I have since left ups and can afford to alternate what shoes I wear everyday to work . My feet still sweat , but ordinary foot powders didnt help remove athletes foot . I read reviews on this , and bought a 2 pack here on amazon . Within a week or two , my athletes foot completely disappeared and the skin on my feet looks and feels wonderful . No more tingling , no dry cracked skin.Pros : best antifungal foot powder I have used . I tried a vast mix of products from drugstores and none had the lasting effect of this one . I have run through my two bottles and am hesitant to switch to the regular zeasorb . Its not much cheaper , but with the rate I go through these bottles , the 2 $ price difference helps.Cons : The price . I used to get generic foot powders for $ 1 . They helped with foot sweating problems , but didnt cure athletes foot . For the price of this , I put it directly on my feet but I cant justify coating the inside of my shoes with this . I still use my generic powders I have on hand to put in my shoes after wearing . This cured my athletes foot problems , but doesnt help so much with moisture . I still switch socks midday.Great product I will continue to use until I manage to find one that deals with moisture better .	1
Several years ago my dermatologist recommended Zeasorb and I have been using it ever since . It has become more a necessity now due to my weight gain following radiation and chemo treatment for late-stage cancer . The powder is helpful in keeping the moist areas of my skin as dry as possible and free from itch . The 2.5 oz . size being sold now is probably as a result of TSA 's size requirements . I was used to buying the 11.5 oz . size in the past . The 2.5 oz . size is more convenient for travel .	1
The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because the product label is misleading . It 's just not for athlete 's foot , it 's also good for jock itch . My derm told me that there 's no difference between this powder and the one that 's labeled & # 34 ; jock itch & # 34 ; . It 's deceiving because the prices are different , whether intentionally or not , it does not matter , consumers should n't have to deal with the confusion . This product gets the job done quickly and easily . I ca n't find a better medical powder out there .	1
The answer to your problem especially in you live in a humid climate ! Powder really works , no strong odor . Well worth the $ .	1
You see results almost immediately with this product . I 'm very happy with it , and I highly recommend it to others .	1
This product works . Used 2x daily to clear up rash and keep the skin dry , and problem solved . It works better than any cream or ointment I 've tried . Highly recommend , particularly if you 've tried other remedies without success .	1
If you 're an athlete , this is great for putting between the toes to keep away athlete 's foot.If you 're a plus-size person , this is great for dusting those areas with bits of skin that touch ( where things can otherwise get sweaty , especially in humid weather ) -- to keep away fungal infections.Zeasorb is a corn-starch based powder . Unlike talc , I understand corn starch is easier on your skin . While I understand they also make a product without fungus-killer Miconazole Nitrate 2 % , I like this one because it keeps the fungus away.Only thing is , you might want to alternate them and I am going to try that -- I understand Miconazole Nitrate is n't meant to be used continually.It would also be great if these products were easier to apply . I 've never liked the whole `` shake things into your hand and tap yourself '' application method . Ca n't we move beyond that in the 21st Century ? It 's pretty basic , there 's no real scent , which is how I like it , and it does the job well . Try it ! And consider the `` subscribe and save '' option , which is a winner in my book .	1
I used this powder after every shower on certain parts of my body . Works great . My doctor told me to use it and it works great .	1
This works for many reasons so you ca n't go wrong . Use for feet and many others parts of the body that need to be kept dry . This small container lasts a long time due to the very fine powder .	1
Really works . Nothing else on market like this . No strong smell no burning . Just works the way it is supposed to	1
I 'm very athletic so I started using this product to prevent heat rashes on my private parts and my inner thighs which were occuring often . This product works very well . I use it daily for preventative care .	1
I cured my very very stubborn jock itch using this and anti fungal cream , I used this because it dries up the skin which helps kill the fungus .	1
If you live in a hot , humid area then this is a must have for you . This stops fungal infections from happening - at least it works for our family . We are highly active and live in an area that is sub-tropical . This means we are almost always damp ( thanks to the humidity ) . This powder can be used all over your body and is n't just for feet .	1
I have hot air heating and it dries things out in the winner . Before I started using this product , I would wake up with very dry mucus in my nose , and if I blow my nose the mucus was bloody.I have tried several approach to reduce the dryness.Ayr Gel put inside the nostril before sleep really did the job . I also use Ayr SalineAyr Saline Nasal Mist , 1.69-Ounce Spray Bottles ( Pack of 6 ) during the day if I feel a bit dry.Ayr Gel inside the nostril works better then room humidifiers which did not solve my problem and cleaning them was a lot of work . I do n't have any tingling or any other feeling . It has no odor . My nose just feels moist and fresh . It is also reasonably priced compared to other products.Ali Julia review	1
After 8 months with a sinus infection that had seemed to have turned my nose a permanent shade of red , my doctor recommended this over-the-counter cream and my red nose ( and sinus infection , with the help of antibiotics ) are gone !	1
I have chronic anemia and am periodically on oxygen , and have developed nearly daily nosebleeds . My hematologist gave me a sample of Ayr because I was in so much pain from the cracking and irritation , I could hardly touch my nose . After a few days using it , my nostrils were actually *flexible* without being too painful again ! I still get nosebleeds but if I keep up with using the Ayr as needed , I do n't have the burning dryness , it does n't hurt to touch the sides of my nose and I can blow my nose ( believe me , that 's an achievement ) .I purchased theAyr Saline Nasal Gel Moisturizing Swabs With Soothing Aloe , 20-Count Swabsto tuck in my purse when I 'm out , since this is Wisconsin and it 's drier than a bone here in the winter.This is better than the entire pile of saline-only mists , treatments and sprays I 've been advised to use .	1
As my husband and I have gotten older we have had increasing nasal dryness during the winter . For a few years we have been using Boroleum at bedtime . The Boroleum is quite helpful -- but it is viscous and smells awful . It is basically petrolatum and camphor . Really do not want to be using it during the day . My husband discovered this Ayr saline nasal gel -- it is very light , liquid , and unscented . We find we need to use it several times a day but it has become indispensable . If I forget to reapply it my nose quickly becomes dry and painful . It almost does n't seem possible that this simple and inexpensive salve could work so well . We have bought so many tubes of this and it is now one of our subscribe and save items . We are always stocking several tubes as we never want to run out of it .	1
I suffer from a very dry nose because of mess I 'm taking . This really helps moisten things up . I 've used it for about a month and the swelling inside has gone down and I can use it several times a day . At night I use something with sesame oil which lasts longer . I would recommend this product .	1
Both my daughter and I have a problem with dry noses and use this product , often multiple times a day , especially in winter . We keep tubes around the house and in the cars . The product is very soothing and last much longer than sprays , including Ayr spray . Highly recommended .	1
It 's winter . That means my nostrils dry up , even with a humidifier running.I apply Ayr Saline Nasal Gel several times a day and my problem with `` dryness '' is resolved.I 've been using it for a couple of weeks now since the actual onset of our Chicago winter and am pleased with the relief it provides . My nostrils are n't dry and I do n't have any crusts or the other ugly things that happen with wintry dry noses.This is great stuff.Jerry	1
I live in Arizona where everything is dried out and most people here have trouble with nose bleeds . Since I am on warfarin , this has caused problems for me with an excessive nosebleed . Now I use this in my nostrils about six times a day .	1
I use this stuff 2 times a day and it seems to keep away the nose bleeds . Much cheaper than buying a whole house humidifier . ( $ 2000 ) .	1
I am a Physician Assistant and frequently recommend this for patients who have nose bleeds or dryness in the nose . It is a great gel alternative to spraying saline in the nose and has a nice light fragrance-probably from the aloe .	1
It 's so soothing to the insides of my nose . Some types of weather makes my nose very dry and the AYR helps a lot . When my nose get too dry it might bleed when I blow it but because of the AYR it does n't bleed as often , The only thing is that you will need Q-tips to apply the AYR . You could use your fingers but I would n't . You never know what 's under them , no matter how much you wash your hands . I would recommend this to any one with this problem .	1
California is a dry state , and I always have a problem sleeping at night because of my dry nose . Ayr saline nasal gel solved that problem ! I just apply it on with q-tips in each nostril ( not too deep inside , just near the outside opening ) - keeps my nose happy every night ! I also brought this with me on a plane . Planes always makes my nostrils uncomfortably dry . Well , this solved that problem as well !	1
I got several of these after nose surgery and i really like it . It 's like liquid air . It really helped keep things moist and i was very pleased with how well this worked . Amazon has the better pricing .	1
During Utah 's dry winters , I experience daily nose bleeds . I 've tried saline nose spray and humidifiers . After a particulary bad nose bleed lasting almost 24 hours , I researched other treatments . I had nothing to loose from trying the Ayr gel . THIS STUFF WORKS ! I have n't had nose bleeds since using the product . I wish I would have known about it years ago . But two instructions for best success:1 . Put the get on the tip of the finger ( not the bottom ) and rub it all around INSIDE the nose & up as high as you can get it . ( make sure your fingernail is cut short ) .2 . Look at your nose in the mirror about an hour later - sometimes there will be white stuff visible . You want to make sure you do n't gross people out.3 . I have to use the product twice daily to prevent all bleeds.This product changed my life ; no more daily bleeds !	1
In the past our ENT recommended we use Ayr Saline Nasal Gel . Our ENT said the Ayr gel would keep our noses from getting overly dry . He said this would help prevent us from getting so many sinus infections . He also suggested we each use a Neti Pot and saline solution . As the doctor pointed out , you can keep Ayr gel with you at all times , but you can not always keep a Neti Pot with you.I do n't know why , but we sneeze almost each time we apply the Ayr gel . The sneezing last for a few seconds and then the sneezing stops . The Ayr gel moisturizes our nasal cavities , which helps us to have fewer nosebleeds.Amazon and Wal Mart charge the same price for the Ayr gel , but when we go to Wal Mart , they are often out of stock . I was glad to find it here at Amazon . When I bought it from Amazon , Amazon had temporarily lowered their price .	1
The bottles are oval , rather than round and are far easier to handle , as well as doing the job intended . It 's great for moisturizing the nasal passages and , if you suffer sinus issues like me , for keeping the sinuses clearer.I use it to drench my sinuses , too , when I do n't have access to the Ayr squeeze bottle irrigator - BTW , **Far** better than a Netipot ! ! ! - and it fits in my purse.I recommend highly .	1
Safe and they work ... Ayr Saline Nasal Mist , 1.69-Ounce Spray Bottles ( Pack of 6 ) ... .a great price at 15.00 for a six pack . I hate nettie pots . So this works great when my nose feels dry and I would recommend these !	1
These sprayers work well and contain a liquid that does what it is supposed to . I found it a little more effective in clearing the airways than the CVS brand liquid nasal spray .	1
I have n't even received this yet , but I 've used it years ago for warding off sinus infections and colds . It washes out germs from your sinuses and is very soothing if you already have a problem that started . Helps heal the sinuses . I also use 8 oz . heated filtered water with a quarter teaspoon sea salt dissolved in water and pour it down my sinuses over the sink which works , too . But this in a bottle is more convenient and an excellent price and a huge quantity so you do n't have to buy for a long time .	1
I have used saline mist every night for years and think it keeps the nasal passages clean and healthy especially in winter . I also think it helps prevent colds .	1
In the Winter the air becomes so dry that my nose and sinuses become very dry as well . I use this several times a day and sometimes during the night to relieve the dryness .	1
Have sjogrens and need to use a saline mist alot -- -this was recommended and this price was also good . Fits into a purse easily which is also a plus .	1
I have used this product for many years and rely on it in the allergy season . I am never without a container in my pocket .	1
For some years I 've had repeated sinus infections . Then two years ago a new ENT Specialist recommended that I use Saline Nasal Mist on a frequent basis ( several times during the day & once or twice during the night ) most especially in the wintertime . ( We already had a new humidifier on our furnace . ) Happily this has made a significant difference for me since I 've followed his directive . I 've only had one sinus infection in the following two years & my night time and early morning stuffiness are minimal so I am sleeping much better & arising without headaches which happened almost daily before.Since this is a saline nasal spray , it can be used daily & indefinitely & costs little ( instead of the other expensive..some over $ 100 a small bottle ... prescription drugs ) and this great OTC spray surely does the `` job '' for me !	1
For someone who always has had troubles with her sinuses , I 'm a big fan of nasal sprays . For some reason , I can not get used to a Netti pot , just the sensation of water makes me gag immediately . I 've tried a lot of sprays , and my past favorite Rhinaris is wonderful , but expensive . Plus , often it would get a little stale and smelled almost to a point of curdled milk if left unused for a while . I like Ayr because of a low price on amazon.And here 's a great tip , if you take care of the bottle and rinse the tip under hot water after every use [ as per directions ] , it never gets stale , always fresh smelling , which really means no smell at all . I usually do 3 sprays in each nostril , which I find does a fine job .	1
.Recently I have been on oxygen most of each day . Although the oxygen helps the condition for which it was prescribed , it drys my nasal membranes . So I get frequent nosebleeds . Sometimes the nosebleeds cut off access to the oxygen.One of my therapists suggested I try Ayr products . I found that Ayr produces a gel , nose drops , and a mist . I decided upon the mist.Ayr Saline Nasal Mist is very helpful . When my nose begins to bleed I spray the mist into my nose and it stops the bleeding . My doctor explained that the sodium chloride in the mist helps form blood clots.I recommend Ayr Saline Nasal Mist for anyone struggling with nosebleeds .	1
Using Ayr for 2 years now and My ENT Doctor says its the bestI can use for dry sinus and congestion problems . It has norecurring side effects . You can use it as much as neededwhenever you need it . Amazon has the best deal anywhere .	1
I have tried a different brand called cromolyn which I ca n't find anymore , but this is the same stuff I think , just different brand and so relieved and so glad to find it . I am mad that I went through four years of steroids and antibiotics when I just needed this product .	1
NasalCrom works great for me , but be careful which size you order . All the boxes look the same , but some are the full size .88oz while others are only .44oz ! ! !	1
I have had allergies diagnosed since I was 4 . I was on all medications they made through the 70s and 80s . I got allergy shots ( which worked ) and used Claritin when it was a brand new prescription , it worked at that time , does n't work for me anymore . Zyrtec works but makes me crazy , it causes weird psychological issues for me . I did n't want to use another prescription because they seem to have more and more side effects now . I decided to try this because I heard people say they liked it . I tried it before and thought it did n't work , so it was years before I tried it again . I learned why it did n't work before ... you MUST use it before the allergy season starts . This year , we had a late snow and cold weather for 2 weeks , so I started using it then . I followed directions and used it every 4 hours . It is a lot to remember when you could take a pill once a day , but there was n't any other options ( I went through all over counter medication and nothing worked for me , I did n't want to go to a doctor ) I should do allergy shots , but you have to go without medication for 2 weeks for testing , so that is not an option during the season . Anyway I did this for 2 weeks and then basically slacked off . I have made it through the allergy season ( and I have been told it is bad this year ) with no issues . Now sometimes I forget to use it for the day , or only use it once or twice and it works . I may still have an itchy mouth , or itchy eyes , but not the miserable I ca n't breathe feeling . I highly recommend , with remembering that you need to use it a week or two before allergies start .	1
After my five year old started suffering really bad allergies this spring I used children 's Zyrtec . It worked but made my son feel `` weird '' and he did n't like it . So I tried Clariton but it did nothing . So I search for something that did n't have side effects and found this . I was drawn to it by the good reviews I found all over the web . Well after 2 days of use my son is allergy free ! I ca n't believe it and I 'm so happy ! I 'm thinking about switching myself from my Rx steroid spray.It 's such a happy moment when you find something that works and it safe.If you suffer or know someone that does , please try this product . It rocks !	1
I love Vicks , I bought some of this for my husband ( he 's on a boat much of the time I thought it might help his stuffy nose ) , and myself .	1
Honestly what 's not to love about this product ? Its a mentholated inhaler ! Very addictive in its own right and it lasts for years and years so its never a bad buy !	1
It is just like it was when I was a child and young adult . These are soothing to the nose , sinuses and upper airway . I have n't seen them in stores in years and years . I was pleased to find them here on Amazon . If you need serious allergy relief , this wo n't take the place of Benedryl or the like , but it is helpful for little breathing congestion .	1
I like this to open my nose rather than sprays . Sprays get addictive and you have to use it more and more . Some of it got in mythroat and actually burned . I can imagine how this hurts nasal membranes .	1
Thanks to this little stick , I do n't have to fight with my gag reflex due to the horrific smells of my fellow airline passengers who fart up a storm as we fly across the oceans and lands of our vast planet . Out of pure necessity did I buy this product and 10 years later I still never travel without it . I 've never used it for anything other than keeping offensive odors away from my nasal passages.I 'd rather spray the offenders with Lysol but since that 's no longer chic or eco friendly , this little gem works amazingly well . Plus , the Vapo Inhaler is US TSA friendly .	1
I suffer constantly with sinus infections . Vaporub ointment works well to but THis is even better no mess and just as good results ! !	1
I have problems breathing at night sometimes and this always helps . Not only that but for some reason putting this in my nose also calms me down and helps me with my stress .	1
When your nose is stuffy , this inhaler works . You do n't have side effects , or upset stomach , or dizziness . It clears your nasal passage easily . Do n't waste your money on pills that either keep you awake or put you to sleep .	1
Although I purchased this from a seller in India and the delivery time was long the item itself is OK . It seems to be stronger than the other Vicks VapoInhaler 's that are sold in the local store . I ordered this because the local store is sold out and the price for this is less expensive .	1
Perfect for helping breathing problems . These are easy to carry . My husband was having bleeding problems and said it even helped him stop the bleeding.I 've always used Vicks since I was a child . It 's great to have something to carry .	1
Decongestant pills deliver the drug to your whole body , so they can cause side effects in your whole body . This inhaler delivers the drug straight to your nose , just where you want it . I find these inhalers more effective than pills , much faster , and with fewer side effects.Decongestant pills usually contain pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine , both of which are stimulants - basically speed . I have tried pseudoephedrine pills and I find they cause insomnia and anxiety . I have not even tried phenylephrine pills . Decongestant pills tend to increase heart rate and blood pressure , and can cause chest pain ( angina ) in some people . A closely related decongestant , phenylpropanolamine ( PPA ) , was withdrawn from the US market because it caused stroke . However , it should be noted that the stroke victims were generally taking very high doses as a weight-loss aid , they were not using decongestant doses.This inhaler contains a very similar stimulant drug , but the dose is very low and it stays mostly in your nose .	1
Are you having a hot summer ? Do n't spend your summer worrying about embarrassing , underarm sweat stains ! Instead , get 72-hour sweat protection from Certain Dri Anti-Perspirant . Both the roll-on and solid provide triple the 24-hour promise of other clinical strength antiperspirants at a fraction of the cost ! Just apply it , forget it and raise your arms in confidence for 72-hours . One of you lucky readers will have a chance to win their choice of the roll-on or solid ! I have n't used a roll on antiperspirant in quite a while so I wanted to change things up a bit . I normally do n't sweat a lot . Of course if I 'm doing a lot of work or out in the heat it can be expected . So I went ahead and gave this a go to see how it would affect me . First of all you should note that there are no smells or scents of any kind coming from the roll on . I love things that smell good , but this is great for those with allergies or ca n't handle scented items . Regardless of that , the deodorant does it 's job . It applies clear without any coloration and dries quickly -- remember , I have the roll-on , not the solid . I can tell you that I 've noticed a difference in just a few days of using it . No excessive sweating while at work ! I 've experienced no irritations , rash , or itching either . Definitely another plus ! If you were to look at the ratings and reviews on Amazon , you would also notice they have a 4.5 out of 5 stars rating . Very impressive ! Needless to say I 've had a wonderful experience . Certain Dri is high quality and best of all -- it works ! The customer service I received was very friendly and quick to respond to any questions . Based off of not only my reviews , but other reviews , I would definitely recommend this product to someone in need of an underarm sweat stain fighter ! Not to mention it is a low cost product . How often do you actually find low cost items that actually work anymore ? Not often . So take advantage of that while you can ! READ FULL REVIEW : [ ... ]	1
I sweat if it 's hot or cold ! ! ! This is the only thing that works for me ! ! ! ! ! I HAVE TOLD ALL MY FRIENDS ! ! ! ! Buy this ! ! ! Just DO NOT use after a shower when you have shaved your arm pits it will bun you . At first it does tingle with applications but after a while your skin gets use to it . I did have a rash/burn looking after first application . But using it when I did not just come out of the shower and/or shaving it works best !	1
Purchased this for my adult son who has excess sweating ; he was so grateful ; `` He was like Mom it really does work , thank you ! '' Sometimes moms have to research products for adult children as they are where we were years ago , raising young children , working and just do n't have the time to get helpful information that will solve their problems . Anyway , it worked for him ... Be sure that whom ever uses this product , that the directions are read carefully as it is not to be used like a deodorant.1 . Use at night before bed ( do this twice in a row ) 2 . Then use every other nightDo n't quote me verbatim , just read the direction for yourself before using , as I 'm sure you would like to get the best use from this product . If it does not work for you see your physician for a stronger version of this product ... Good Luck !	1
when i was in high school , i perspired excessively . it was so embarrassing . i always had huge wet spots under my arms . i saw a commercial for certain-dri and i decided to give it a try since normal anti-perspirants did n't seem to help at all . after using certain-dri for a few months , my problem was gone . then i tapered off my use and only used it once a month or so . i have n't used it in a few years now and i do n't sweat under my armpits any more unless i am working out . i recommended this product to my sister , who was in her late 30 's , and she had the same results . i 'm not sure how it works , but it definitely does the job !	1
I ordered this product based on customers reviews to treat hyperhidrosis . It 's been almost a month using it and it has definitely improve the condition.I read reviews saying that it itches , burns , etc . etc . etc . I dont know if my armpits are so used to high core products but It NEVER burned or itched . This is my experience , remember , everyone is different ... .It took me like 3 weeks to really notice the difference , and it is not that Im not sweating , but is definitely less . I feel more comfortable now wearing all sort of colors and textures , because I know my sweat is under control ... I highly recommend this product to whoever suffers hyperhidrosis . I use it every single night , to be honest , Im not counting the strokes , but I make sure that everything gets cover with the product , and then go to sleep . In the morning I shower and I use Dove Clinical strength for the day and that 's it . In the past I would carry an anti-antiperspirant in every single bag , Now I only use it in the morning and stay fresh and dry all day long.I 'm very happy with this purchase !	1
I saw a TV commercial for this . I thought it would n't work so I got it from Walmart so I could easily take it back if it did n't . IT WORKED . Now I 'm getting it from Amazon after this bottle runs out.It 's not that it hides odor any better , it 's that it stops wetness better.It 's no secret about the aluminum ingredients . The only thing keeping the mainstream deodorant makers form using the same ingredients is controversy over the effects of aluminum absorption into the system .	1
I was skeptical of 1. how can this work as well as other are saying , and 2. can this be healthy ? I ca n't attest to # 2 , but can give my opinion on # 1 . I 'm the type of guy that will sweat at the drop of the hat . I only wear t-shirts , even in the winter , due to the fact that I 'll sweat too much otherwise . Ca n't wear certain shades of blue due to the giant visible circles of sweat that would appear by the end of the day under my pits . Started using this and after a few days had n't really seen results . I nearly gave up , and suddenly like magic I noticed a tremendous difference in the amount , or lack thereof , that I was sweating . As other 's have stated - I 've actually weened off of this now after just a few uses while still maintaining the effects . Again , I question how healthy this can possibly be with such long side effects but I 'm going continue to use it until I see any negative side effects . Down to about once a week or two usage . Definitely continue to use standard deodorant for smell purposes .	1
I sweat a lot , for no reason ! I was limited to wearing black or white shirts because of the constant wet pit stains . Someone recommended this to me , and I 'm so glad I bought it . It 's really been a miracle product ! I 've tried those `` clinical strength '' antiperspirants , and they do help a little , but nothing like this . I absolutely can not believe how effective it is , even on my `` faucet pits ! '' I was nervous just applying it at bedtime and nothing in the morning , but I followed the directions diligently and it did what it said it would ! And no BO during the day either ! My ONLY small complaint is that it made my pits extremely itchy for the first few nights I used it , but that stopped after about 4-5 days . I swear it seals your pits shuts . I will never buy a different antiperspirant !	1
Ever since about the 7th grade , I 've been a sweaty little girl . If it 's over 75 and I 'm just standing I sweat . If I 'm sitting , I 'd sweat . I 'd sweat like crazy when I get nervous . It was gross - but not so much the gross sweat that I hated but more the smell . By the end of the day I would just REEK ! I 'm very girly and I love to wear lots of pretty girly things ... not always cotton but spandex and nylon . But I was constantly running to the girls room with tissues and wet wipes just to wipe myself down so I did n't stink in an hour. , So now I 'm 30 , am in a serious relationship with someone and I get very nervous being close to him because I 'm afraid of the ominous stink . But then I came across this . Certain dri has saved my life . I wish I had known about this years ago ! ! ! ! I apply it every other day and my little underarms are fresh and dry , even if it 's 90 degrees outside and the rest of my is drenched . But now I do n't mind so much if I 'm sweaty anywhere else because the stinky is gone ! ! And I do n't even have to wear another deodorant ! ! ! THANK YOU CERTAIN DRI ! ! ! ! ! !	1
Certain Dri Anti-Perspirant works for both men and women . One application will last up to 72 hours . This product is often recommended by doctors to those who are prone to sweating . The best part is that even those with sensitive skin can find relief . Certain Dri Solid is the strongest formula available . You can purchase your own to try for right around $ 6 . That 's a great deal because this stuff really works !	1
Works but hurts and itches like crazy when you put it on after shaving . I purchased for wedding as this issue was a big concern for me . Shaved on Thursday pm in preparation for rehearsal dinner on Friday ( since I knew I would n't have time to shave on Friday with a huge to-do list ) , used deodorant on Friday night prior to wedding day . However , still used another light layer of different kind ( a roll-on ) over it and had no issues whatsoever the next day . No , wiping off on his tux or anything . This was all a HUGE concern of mine too . Everything went perfectly and I did n't have to think about if I smelled or anything at all that day .	1
Forget the scented & # 34 ; clinical strength deodorants & # 34 ; on the market -- this is the only one that compares to prescription treatments . I 'd recommend it to anyone with excessive sweating or hyperhydrosis who ca n't afford professional treatment .	1
I suffer from hyperhidrosis baddd and when I say bad , I mean horrible . Any amount of movement I do , and my armpits are sweating like crazy . I shovel snow without a coat on because my armpits end up on fire and start dripping . Now I never get musty , but I would sweat so much that after my shirt armpits dried , they were hard and it was just disgusting . I have stopped wearing white shirts , and especially anything that you 'd see me perspire through . I have tried all of the deodorants that say & # 34 ; keeps you dry , keeps you fresh , blah blah blah. & # 34 ; I 'd even put those on at night and would still drench my shirts . Now certain dri works ... I did n't think so but it is amazing . I put it on at night ( every three days because it lasts that long for me ) and I wake up and shower . It does n't rinse off and I am good to go . Dry arm pits all day ! It 's so amazing . I had been seeing a dermatologist and he did n't recommend this to me . I just picked it up at walmart on my own . Anyways it DOES work and I also do n't get & # 34 ; stinky & # 34 ; with it . While it does n't really have a fresh scent like Dove or Suave or whatever it gives me no smell ... and I absolutely recommend it .	1
If you have profuse sweating problems , thank the lord , because your problems are over . One swath of this under each arm and you can kiss those sweat rings good-bye . Ok , you wo n't want to do that , but if you have had that problem for as many years as I have , you may actually do it.The bottle says to use only on underarms , I advise that you follow that . However , I put some on my forehead every couple of days to keep those bothersome sweat beads out of my eyes ( I wish I had bushy eyebrows ) . I have noticed an increase in perspiration on other parts of my body , especially while sleeping , but that is a small price to pay for the benefits .	1
You do not use this like normal deodorant ! As the information on the box taught me , there is a difference between deodorant and anti-persperant . Deodorant is usually a fragrance . Anti-persperant actually stops the sweating.How does this work ? It 's NIGHTTIME ONLY ! You have to put this on before bed , and only on clean underarms after a shower . Make sure you have n't recently shaved your armpits or recently used a loofa or something else that could cause tiny abrasions in the skin.You roll it on with 2-3 strokes ( it 's the kind with the ball tip ) and go to bed . The liquid closes the pores in your underarm skin . The instructions say it 's safe and that it 's only about 6 % of your sweat area , so your body will release sweat elsewhere.And this is supposed to be effective for 72 hours . Even if you shower the next morning.I can say this has worked for me . I 'm not an excessive sweater , I bought this based on the high ranking/reviews of the product on Amazon , not realizing it was for excessive sweaters . I 'm still getting used to using it . I shook the bottle some and when I took the cap off , liquid dripped out from the edges of the ball tip . And I 've missed some area of my arm pits where I could smell sweat . But the areas I covered ... smelled like regular skin . Pretty amazing . Fragrance free.Would I have bought this if I knew it was a specialty item with crazy instructions ? Maybe not . But it works well ! So I 'm going to rate it for what it can do . And that 's 5 stars .	1
This is an amazing product . I 've went through multiple brands , even tried all sorts of Secret , but nothing worked for me . I do n't usually sweat unless I 'm nervous . After trying Certain Dri Roll-On , I got rid of everything else I had . This thing is amazing , and you do not need to use it daily . Just apply once every 4-6 days depending on how often you need it . I apply it about once a week . It dries quickly and leaves no stains . Be sure NOT to use it after you have shaven or if you have extra sensitive skin as it could irritate . You can use the solid version if you have sensitive skin . Do n't forget to get the A.M. Certain Dri as it gives a refreshing smell for the morning .	1
For years now , I pretty much had to stick to black shirts since I sweat so much . A quick Google search turned me on to Certain Dri , so I bought some and gave it a whack . I put it on every night for 3 nights in a row . Now I only put it on every 2 or 3 nights , and I have been getting great results ! I switched from using your standard antiperspirants , to a combination of this and regular deodorant . My white undershirts are n't suffering from the nasty yellow pit-stains that normal antiperspirants cause , and I 'm able to wear other shirts now without worrying about having wet armpits . We 've had a hot May , and so far June here in Detroit ... I 've only had minimal issues with sweat , even when it hits the upper 80 's and 90 's ! This stuff also seems to work well , even when working out or running !	1
Finally , a solution to damp pits ! I previously had horrendous sweating , and had to change anti-perspirants almost weekly . Nothing had ever worked . Now , I can put this on once a week , and use my regular stuff daily . It actually works , and I have n't had a single instance of wet pits since I started using it . I 'm blown away that it took me so long to find this ! It does sting a bit at night when you apply it , but it is absolutely worth it for the results .	1
I purchased this as I was having a real problem with underarm sweat in the last several years . I read the reviews on Amazon and did take everything to heart regarding usage of the product . I must say that I have been noticing a difference in the fact that I do n't seem to perspire as much , and that I can usually get away with using the product 1 - 2 times per week . At first I was using it about 3 - 4 times per week . But now , thankfully the sweat issue is not as bad with the underarms . Now other areas , well that 's another story . LOL ! But all in all I give this product 5 starts for controlling the sweat . The only thing I would say is somewhat troublesome is the itching sensation I do get after applying the product . But that usually goes away after an hour or so . Purchase this product is you are experiencing extreme underarm perspiration . You will be glad you included it in your hygiene regimen ! !	1
I wish I knew about this product years ago . It has some side effects , but you will get use to it and no more sweating !	1
I love Certain Dri . I 'm not sure I could get along in life without it . When I first started using Certain Dri over a decade ago , I would use it every day . Then , I dropped down to using it every other day after maybe two or three weeks . Now , I feel I only need to give my underarms a few swipes once a week . This is incredible because I used to sweat like a beast . I mean , just sitting down without moving around would make my underarms sweat profusely . Gross . I do n't worry about that anymore . I do wish that the product worked on hands , though . I have n't had any success trying to get it to work on my hands . However , that 's not how the product is marketed . It is just wishful thinking .	1
Awesome . Just tried it last night , and bam ! no sweat this morning on the way to school . But definitely make sure to follow the instructions carefully , as I 'm sure a product of this strength would n't be fun if misused , so apply sparingly and at night .	1
Skip all those & # 34 ; clinical strength & # 34 ; products that are sold by big name brands and just buy this ! Certain Dri has helped me SO much , I do n't think I could live without it ! Ever since middle school I 've had problems with underarm perspiration , but not anymore . I 've been using this for maybe 8 years now , I used to apply it every singe night before bed , but now I use it about once every other week and its still working ! Listen to the instructions and DO NOT apply it after showering , even if you have n't shaved your underarms , it 's so uncomfortable and itchy ! I really ca n't express how much I love this . Even when the rest of my body is soaked in sweat from working out in the hot sun in Florida , my underarms are still dry !	1
I have used Certain-Dri for about 5 years now . It is a milder version of the prescription strength Drisol , an aluminum chloride product.I apply it to my underarms about every other day . It does not need to be used each day . In fact , if I use it every day , my underarm tissue becomes inflammed , dry , may crack , and be painful.Certain-Dri works best if it applied at night before bedtime . I have noticed upon application that the solution may burn a tiny bit , especially if I do not air out my armpits and get the solution to dry . If I leave it wet ( closing my armpits with my arms ) , it may burn a bit and also cause an itching sensation . If so , I spread it around with the palm of my hand and air dry the area and then the pain goes away.No doubt about it - it works ! It will dry out underarms ( that is the only place I have used it ) . I imagine it will work on other areas of the body just as well.Certain-Dri does not have much of an odor to it , so I do recommend using a scented deodorant or anti-perspirant in addition to Certain-Dri.I think you will be pleased with the results . If it does not work for you , then I would recommend you upgrade to Drisol , which your doctor can prescribe for you.Jim Koenig	1
I always used this product , it works great and I will def buy again ! I love a product that does what it claims	1
If you use it correctly , you wo n't have any problems or perspiration.Do NOT put on a shirt directly after applying and do NOT use while armpits are sweaty or wet.Works perfectly if you follow the rules !	1
So glad I checked online for something I use daily . I have used this product for years at a high cost . Now this problem is solved . Thanks Amazon !	1
What would I do without Certain Dri ? ? ? I 've been using it for several years now , and this is why I love Certain Dri : I could be sitting calmly in a cool room and still have sweat drenched armpits.Before I started using Certain Dri , I 'd have to bring an extra clean shirt to work , along with deodorant and baby wipes to try and clean my armpits throughout the day . But since I started using Certain Dri , I can wear sleeveless blouses for the first time in my life . Really , Certain Dri has changed my life , sounds corny , I know , but I wish I 'd tried it years ago.Regarding itching and sensitive skin , I have this problem and sometimes it would itch so much it would wake me up at night . I use unscented deodorant during the day , and that probably helps . Plain ol ' hydrocortisone did n't do much , but what REALLY works to alleviate the itching is Dermarest Eczema Medicated Lotion . It has 1 % hyrdocortisone in it , like other ointments , but for some reason , the Dermarest Eczema lotion works the best , within a few minutes the underarm itchiness is gone . Give it a try , and do n't give up on Certain Dri ... .. it is one of a kind for being rid of underarm wetness . Start out using it only a couple nights a week if you experience skin irritation , and about 15 minutes after applying Certain Dri , go ahead and apply Dermarest to your underarms .	1
I bought two of them for my boyfriend . He had already tried several deodorants in the market and they 've done nothing . But this one , it 's awesome . His arm pits are desert dry .	1
At times I seem to suffer from a more nervous sweat than just normal sweat . I wanted something that would curb the issue . This really does it . Great product that I highly recommend .	1
I started having problems with excessive armpit sweat in high school . I was so embarrassed by it , I wore a jean jacket everyday to hide the sweat marks ( I grew up in Hawaii so wearing a jacket all the time was a bit odd ... and hot ! ) . I wanted to join ROTC in college but the sweat marks were even worse when wearing the uniforms and I knew I would have to do things like salute and whatnot where I would have to expose my underarms so I dropped ROTC . I tried so many different types of antiperspirants but did n't find a solution till I was 21 years old . Certain Dri ! ! ! The first couple times of applying it REALLY burned and left some red bumps , but it was well worth it ! I used to put it on every other night then as time went on , I found I could use it less and less . Now at the age of 27 I find I do n't really need it anymore . About every 7-8 months I have to use it for a couple weeks but then I can go back to normal deodorant ! I have become much more confident and relaxed since discovering Certain Dri.I give it 5 stars regardless of the extreme burn in the beginning !	1
This product works ... It works so good ... It kinda worries me as my underarm did n't sweat at all for 2 days ! ! ! !	1
Due to medicine I started experiencing excessive sweating that my normal deodorant could n't cover . This was recommended by a friend and has been perfect ever since taking ! No issues what so ever	1
A bit of backstory : I 've had what one would call `` excessive perspiration '' in my underarms for a few years now . I 've tried a dozen different regular antiperspirants and none could quite match my expectations and they all left me frustrated and disappointed , as well as with yellow aluminum stains on my shirts . Then I found Certain Dri and thought I would give it a chance after hearing about it from a friend and how well it works . I have very sensitive skin that is prone to dryness , redness , and flaking , and so I went with what was recommended by the manufacturer itself : Certain Dri Solid stick.I began with the solid stick application at night this past winter in an effort to stop my unprovoked dampness under my arms . It took almost 3 weeks with the stick for me to notice any real results , and at the same time I had been using a regular antiperspirant ( Old Spice , Mitchum ) in the morning . For about 4-5 months things seemed to work alright . I definitely felt like I sweat less under my arms but there would always seem to be an obnoxious dew that would show up mid-day even though I was n't doing anything physically demanding nor was I anxious or nervous . Finally , the day came where I was thoroughly fed up and decided to go against my hesitation and give Certin Dri Roll-On a try . At this point I was so frustrated I did n't care about any stinging or redness or any of the other stories you can read about ; I just wanted to stop feeling uncomfortable throughout the day.Enter Certain Dri Roll-On . . . after my first night 's application of 2 strokes/underarm , I noticed an improvement the next day ; it seemed to be working better than the solid stick ever worked for me . No stinging , no itching , no redness , no rash - no apparent side-effects other than what is intended . I kept up with my 2 stroke routine and after a week and a half of nightly use I noticed a dramatic improvement . After going out that day I noticed I had experienced absolutely no sweating during times when I normally would have sweat.I have been keeping with this routine for 2 weeks now and I feel better than ever . I do n't feel like I 'm sweating for no reason anymore and I do n't have that insufferably uncomfortable dampness under my arms I would get from just sitting still . I put onOld Spice Classic Deodorant , Original Scent , 3.25-Ounces ( Pack of 6 ) ( no more yellow aluminum stains for me ) in the morning after my shower and I am all set for the entire day . I 've yet to cut back to trying every other day with the Certain Dri for fear of my sweating returning , but I will soon give it a go . Either way , I could n't be more pleased with my results.As far as any stinging , itching , or burning goes : *read and follow the directions carefully* - DO NOT apply Certain Dri after showering or shaving your underarms . Use it sparingly - I understand the temptation to really coat your pits in an effort to eradicate your sweat glands , but trust me - less is more with this stuff : 2 strokes max . I 've been using the roll-on every night for 2 weeks now and I have n't had a single instance of any sort of irritation or redness . The most I 've felt was a mild itch one night which disappeared after 20 minutes . The applicator itself could be a problem for men with hairy armpits ... The ball rolls against your skin and can catch your armpit hairs and pull on them or even yank them out , but really this is hardly more than a tiny pinch and if you trim or shave your pits you obviously wo n't have this issue.Be aware that everyone 's body is different so everyone 's body will react differently to this product . If you get a rash : stop use and give the solid stick a try ( it may work better for you personally as the active ingredient is a different in both ) .Finally : HAVE PATIENCE - as I mentioned above I only saw dramatic results and the virtual elimination of my excess sweating after a week and a half of nightly application . I almost gave up entirely after a few days before dedicating myself to sticking to it and it paid off.In conclusion , if you suffer from excessive perspiration or hyperhidrosis , definitely give this product a try . I 'd recommend buying it from Walmart where I purchased it for about $ 4.70 . I am extremely pleased with this product 's performance after an initial waiting period and I only hope it does n't fail me like the solid did . A confidence-saver product all around. -- -- -*****10/6/12 UPDATE*****A quick update just to report that Certain Dri Roll-On has been working fantastically since I wrote this review . My excessive perspiration has been eliminated and I can feel comfortable going out without having to worry about sweating uncontrollably and unprovoked . This really is a beauty of a product and definitely changed my day-to-day life for the better .	1
I 've recently started feeling the affects of lactose intolerance and it has put a serious damper on my food experiences . Most of the time I just go without any lactase supplements and risk the small amounts of dairy that comes with the meal . However , when I go for lattes or cheesecake I practically inhale these . They work amazingly quickly , allowing you to take two and just have at it right away.I 'm also a bit self conscious about my intolerance . These are individually packed and come in pretty small wrappings . I hide some in my pocket for those days out and if I ever need some I can just turn around and quickly take a few . Very convenient and very effecti ... OMGBRB ICE CREAM TRUCK !	1
The packs came om on time within the promised date . The chewable tablets are better than the caplets since these are tasty and dont need a drink of water	1
I need these to survive and I prefer the chewable kind if I do n't have any water around . I am very lactose intolerant and these help me enjoy dairy . Also , I find that they always taste better than the store-brand chewable kind .	1
I 've been lactose intolerant since I 've been 33 . And the product has improved over the decades I first used it in terms of stability : previously it went bad with an odd smell after a while . Now it is separately wrapped ( but expensive ) . It can be kept in your wallet , coat , desk , etc . for those impulse ice cream or milk or butter/cheese filled products ( e.g . pesto , pizza ) . Not needed for yogurt . I also prefer buying the cheaper bottle of the 1/3 dose in the bottle for home use . The single use caplets are greatly wrapped for airtight . I do n't purchase the chewable tablets , which are larger in size . I often bite the tablets , which makes the tablets work more efficiently , and gulp it down with what I 'm eating ( the directions say you just take the tablet whole with the first bite of the dairy food ) .If you continue to eat a meal with butter , ( etc ) you have to take additional tablets after 30-45 minutes , since the tablet will be down the intestine and ca n't handle what new food is there . E.g . if you are having a long cheese dessert , or a pizza party .	1
man ! i wish i knew about this when i was younger ! I never knew that there were pills about this to help with lactose intolerance ... do you guys know how much i suffered bc of milk when i was young ? all that diarrhea ? it sucked ! One day I was like hmmm what if there are pills we can take for lactose intolerance ? And there was ! I was eager to try it . I 'm partly lactose intolerant and It 's not that severe . I only get diarrhea when I eat a lot of dairy but ti 's not too bad . I take this whenever I drink milk and it does work . I do n't get diarrhea like I use to . Now of course this might not work for you bc everyones body response differently to pills .	1
Lactose intolerance can be very stressful to deal with . Having to decline food , opportunities to eat because you ca n't digest is embarrassing and annoying . This solves the problem . Take one with your first bite and you can eat dairy products . It says take another after 45 mins but to be safe I would take it 30 mins after if you continue to eat dairy products.I prefer these to the chewables because I can fit a few in my wallet.If you have an empty stomach , be careful when eating lactose containing foods and drinking lots of liquids at the same time . That is the only time I 've ever had issues . I took a bite of bagel with cream cheese and a Lactaid and then chugged a bottle of water , needless to say the Lactaid was n't able to work very well in my empty stomach filled with water and a bit of cream cheese , my stomach was very upset.I drink the Lactaid milk all the time as well - I really like the whole milk.Great products .	1
I bought this for my son who was visiting . He took it home with him . He really liked the fact that it is fast acting .	1
Lactaid Fast Act Lactase Enzyme Supplement , Chewable Tablet , Vanilla Twist 60 ea ... but of medical necessity . Lataid Fast Act and all that preceded it are and were essential to my physical well-being . Lactaid always did its job as long as I did mine , which means , follow the directions and take the product with the first bite of anything dairy ( in my case . ) I would never hesitate to recommend Lactaid products to others . I am certain that your results will be equally satisfactory , unless your need is due to another medical problem , in which case I ca n't say . Now , go eat a great big ice cream cone , a bagel slathered with cream cheese , a large bowl of cereal ( with your Lactaid milk , of course , ) and a plate full of macaroni and cheese , and hum your way through each bite . ( For this feast of four items , three of which do not contain Lactaid from another source , you will want to take one pill for each . )	1
I have used it for years , but lately I have tried the NOW Dairy Digest and am very pleased with it too . So just take your pick ! You ca n't go wrong if you are bothered with lactose intolerance . I do n't know about other people but I was sick to death of the pain associated with not being able to digest lactose !	1
This is great if you remember to take it before you eat dairy . PhaZyme is better for after you realized you forgot to take the pill before . It 's just that simple .	1
I 've been lactose intolerant since 1988 . Digestive disease doctors did n't know much about it then ; not sure about now . When they became available I used the lactase drops ; yuck . The chewable tablets seemed perfect , but many people have trouble with the Mannitol contained in those ( it makes them sweeter , so that you can chew them ) . And people who used the chewable form had digestive problems suddenly . So I am switching proactively ; the last thing I need is another digestion problem .	1
I really like this vanilla twist flavor - kind of a creamy flavor . This is effective for lactose intolerance . I always use lactase before I eat dairy . It makes a big difference for me .	1
These pills work great for me . I swallow a couple of them before dairy dishes like pizza and am able to enjoy cheese without feeling awful .	1
I purchase Lactaid online because it is cheaper and if I spend over $ 25 at Amazon they will ship it for free.This product does help me with some dairy products and I am glad it is available . There are some dairy products that I can not digest though even if I take a product such as Lactaid . It goes to paying attention to yourself and what your body can tolerate .	1
Just make sure you read the dosage . The dosage is different than with the individual packets . These are not as strong .	1
I HAVE HAD LACTOSE INTOLERANCE ALL MY LIFE . That means I have had it so long that no one knew what I had as a baby , but I was regulated to Goat 's milk and Karo syrup and water and evaporated milk on some kind of rotating schedule that drove everyone nuts . Mostly , it gave me a great dislike for milk , and I grew up anyway . I just did not drink milk.On sleepover 's , my mom sent a note saying I was allergic and I could have Lemonade , Kool-Ade or Coke instead . It was a great way to avoid milk , but played hob with my teeth which had more than their fair share of cavities.I do n't remember exactly when Lactaid came on the market . I did not know anyone else who was Lactose Intolerant until After it was out . Back in the 60 's one did NOT talk about anything that one had that was `` Different . '' Not drinking milk fell into that category . So , when I saw Lactaid on the shelf at the pharmacy , I gave it a try . Wow ! I could eat ice cream , drink shakes , down yoghourt , and guzzle a glass of 4 % milk if I were so inclined . All I had to do was chew the proper number of tablets , generally one , prior to imbibing anything with Lactose in in and my stomach behaved itself as long as I followed the directions on the box.For me Lactaid is a phamaceutical miracle . Finally , at an age somewhere close to God 's , or , at least over 60 , I can drink a Chocolate Malt with the best of them . My favorite is Sonic with an extra scoop of chocolate and an extra scoop of malt . Heaven on earth.I have no negatives about this product . I follow the directions . It works . I get to have chocolate malts for breakfast . I absolutely recommend this to anyone who is dx with Lactose Intolerance or who suspects they may have it . It is inexpensive and works as directed . I keep some in my purse and in the cupboard at all times . Use it and enjoy milk products . Hoorah ! ! ! !	1
I have a pretty bad case of lactose intolerance . Even the slightest amount of dairy affects me . Luckily , I am not a huge fan of dairy . But , there are times when I want to enjoy a bowl of ice cream , some pizza , or even a slice of cheese on a sandwich . Also , it 's amazing how many things have dairy in them without you realizing it.Whenever I know I am going to have dairy , I take Lactaid . It does a great job . It is n't always 100 % effective - sometimes , I 'll still experience symptoms even after taking it . But , the symptoms are n't nearly as bad.I also take Lactaid if I am unsure about a particular food . Because it is n't a drug , I do n't mind taking it in the event that I may unknowingly ingest some dairy.If using this , make sure that you take it right before you have dairy . Also , if you will be eating for a little while , take another . I will usually take one every 30 minutes if enjoying a long meal .	1
My mom has Type 2 diabetics . She began to start throwing up . The doctor confirmed that it was what we thought . She was lactoss intolerant . We greatly reduced the milk products she takes ( i.e. , milk , cheese , etc . ) and had her take one of these pills before each meal . It worked wonders ! And the cost when you subcribe to delivery ! CVS charged me about $ 8.82 for just 32 pills . Now I can get 60 for $ 12.12 ( I think that was the new price since they just went up slightly . ) Well worth it folks . Highly recommend . And my mom 's sugar as dropped so much her diabetic medicine has been reduced ! I never knew that milk had natural sugar in it .	1
After years of suffering from Lactose intolerance this is an immediate relief . One tablet per dairy consumption is not enough , but two does the trick for me . Now I can enjoy my bowl of ice cream or even a warm cup of hot chocolate without going for a non-dairy substitute .	1
These Lactaid tablets work well to prevent lactose intolerance induced disasters . The tablets are packaged in a way that is easy to carry around in your bag , pocket or other portable methods.I can finally enjoy foods with dairy again . I suggest taking one right before your first bite of foods with dairy and then having another in the middle of eating dairy if it is a good amount of food or you have been eating for a while . I 'm very cautious so I like to be on the safe side I guess.The tablets are composed of lactase , a naturally made enzyme that people with lactose intolerance lack , so there should n't be any side effects to taking `` too many '' tablets . I would just use common sense and experiment with how many tablets to take when eating various dairy products .	1
These caplets work just fine for people who are lactose intolerant . Makes as big a difference as night does for day !	1
These pills are great for anyone that gets terrible farts from dairy . If your tummy starts to ache and people do not want to be near you after a bowl of ice cream , these are your new best friend . You must take them as stated with the first bite of offending food but if you do your tummy should be much happier AND your family and friends should be happier too .	1
I love these . I am able to have the dairy products I like without any consequences . Each pill is in its own little package and each package has a perforated edge . This means you can tear one or two pills off and easily carry them in your wallet . I like that convenience . I tried a generic version of these pills . They did not seem to work as well and definitely not as fast . I can take this as I am having the dairy and it works just as well .	1
Love these tabs . Trust them with my eyes closed . I normally take one with a glass of whole milk and i 'm fine . if i 'm having icecream or pizza i will have two , depending on quantity . i always take one five minutes before having any dairy and if a second is required i take it halfway through consumption .	1
I hav n't run my wife out of the room after having dairy products not one time since getting this . I take one more than they recommend on the box though , it does the job .	1
I was taking accutane medication and woke up one morning with my eyes so dry my eyelids were stuck to my eyes . I could not even open them without putting drops in my eyes first . It was extremely painful . For the remainder of my treatment I used this every night and it was a life saver . My eyes were still sometimes a bit dry but never again had the nightmare of waking up with my eyes sealed shut.This stuff is very thick and is like putting vaseline on your eyes . You will not be able to read clearly for a few minutes after application . It is meant only for night use and for that it works well.If this is too thick for you use this instead : [ ... ] Also remember to take fish oil for your dry eyes . My optometrists noticed a great improvement in my eyes after using fish oil and this product .	1
I like this every night for my dry eyes . It makes wearing my contacts the next day a lot more comfortable .	1
I suffer with very very dry eyes . They sting a lot and I frequently have to put drops in them . Recently the drops just were n't doing it for me anymore ... . felt like someone glued my eyelids open and sat me in front of an industrialized heavy duty fan . I had to take frequent naps daily just to help with my stinging dry eyes . I got headaches when I read or stared at the computer too long cause of persistent stinging . For my 'Dry eye syndrome ' this is the FIRST and ONLY product that has really helped . My eyes are no longer red . They do not burn , they do not dry out quickly.I still use liquid drops but maybe only once of twice daily and this is only because I am afraid my eyes dry out again.This product is worth the money and I highly recommend it .	1
I 've been using this for years to help relieve the burning , itching , sand-like feeling in my eyes during spring allergy time : ( It feels so cool and refreshing , it 's like putting a cooling/cleansing ice cube in your eye . I LOVE this . My husband has also uses it too to flush his eyes when doing carpentry work . For 3 bucks , what do you have to lose ? best product out there	1
With this & # 34 ; bulk & # 34 ; of eye wash and an eye cup you can flush your eyes easily , getting the irritants out and moistening them .	1
The single-use container version ( no preservative ) of Thera Tears is the only one that gives my dry eyes relief , and I 've been using this product for years . I 've tried other products , which irritate my eyes rather than soothe them . More important to me than the applicator design is the availability and pricing of the single-use container version . Unfortunately , Walmart and Target ( whose pricing was great at only $ 8.58 per box ) recently stopped selling the boxes of single-use containers in their stores . So , now I 'm researching new sources for best pricing and availability .	1
I am so happy that Theratears listened to customer complaints and went back to the old applicators . My suspicions are that someone in the design team actually tried to use the hooked tip and realized the design was TERRIBLE .	1
I have chronic dry eye due to Sjogren 's Syndrome , and have found these to be the best artificial tears for me . They were recommended by my eye doctor , and I have been using them for years , along with my prescription meds . So , to start I am completely pleased with the drops themselves ... HOWEVER ... .I was dismayed ( as were a lot of others from what I can tell ) when TheraTears changed `` tip/dropper '' into a hook shape in which the cap can not be replaced for reuse through the day . I 'm assuming that this was done for `` sanitary '' reasons , but the fact is I use one dropper per day , throughout the day . For years now I have been scooping up the `` old '' version ( with replaceable cap ) when I see them in stores . Today I found what appeared to be a new supply of the `` old style '' dropper and picked up three boxes . I brought them home and compared them with my dwindling supply of the `` old ones '' and immediately noticed something was not quite right ... .Yes , they LOOK like the `` old style '' dropper but they are molded differently and the tip is snapped off rather than twisted off ... therefore CAN NOT be snapped back on ( I have tried and ca n't ) . NOOOO TheraTears ! I 've been skunked ! So , a warning to fellow TheraTears fans ... these new ones are disappointingly NOT like the original vial despite the packaging . The product itself is the same.I 'm truly disappointed .	1
I like thee individual containers . I think they probably keep the contents frsh and free from contamination . each single use container is enough to provide ample moisture to sooth one or two eyes .	1
We buy these for my 89-year-old mother . It is so much easier than having a little bottle that she can not get the top off of.We buy them on Amazon.com because we live in a remote area of Montana and shopping is 60 miles one-way away ( besides , the prices are up to 40 % higher and with Amazon delivering FREE to our door within 48 hours , why go anywhere else ? ) Anyway , these are the same name brand I have bought elsewhere for a lot more and they are excellent .	1
Better than all other eye drops ... put together . Not as much detrimental residue . Less/no irritation . And more effective . Not even close . Do it .	1
I liked it very much for a trip to Europe for a noisy plane . It really was cheaper than buying noise canceling headphones and they served two purposes . They helped with the ear pressure and with noise . My husband said that I was whispering when I had them in and that he could not hear me . ( Not such a bad thing ? )	1
Finally , I found something to stop the pain of airplane pressure . All my years of suffering and then not flying . This item should be promoted better . I did not even know they existed until someone recommended them to me . Free from pain while flying at last !	1
I have used Earplanes for a number of years when flying and they helped tremendously with my severe ear pain on landings . I did have to struggle to get them inserted firmly in my ears . Then I found they also make Childrens and Small Ears size and have used that version ever since . They are awesome ! The smaller size for my small ears fit perfectly with no hassle in getting them firmly inserted . I could not fly without them to relieve my unbearable ear pain/pressure .	1
This has to be the best antiperspirant-deodorant on the market . It has no smell of its own , causes absolutely NO irritation at all , and does both jobs really well . On occasions where I ca n't shower daily ( camping ) , this stuff has actually lasted up to 4 days without failing the `` odor test . '' Thanks Almay ! And thanks Amazon for carrying it , it is difficult to find in stores .	1
I was so happy to be able to get this through Amazon . I no longer can find this product in most stores and because of an allergic reaction , I need to use a deodorant for sensitive skin and this one does do the trick .	1
I 've looked for this , and was glad to find it . It was well packaged , and came promptly . One bottle locked up pretty soon -- but fluid solidified around the seal and the ball would not roll -- had to dig it out -- have not had this happen in past with such a new bottle .	1
Still get some wetness but there is no smell or irritation . I might try the stick version when I finish the roll-on .	1
As expected ! Got a positive too , so no complaints !	1
My product came with three pregnancy tests and 1 fertility testI took a test and the answer was negative , which was accurate because I was n't pregnant . I will update my review if I have anything else to share !	1
This is my third pregnancy and I have used the First Response to test all three times ! It always detected my pregnancy hormones before my missed period . The last time it was positive 4 days before my period was due . The line was faint but it was there . Very sensitive test . Would def recommend it .	1
I bought FRER pregnancy tests after two years of using the cheaper Wondfu tests on amazon . I loved the wondfu tests and left excellent feedback but my third batch I got false positives which was , obviously , heartbreaking . I decided to spend more money and buy these tests instead . Well I got my BFP today and confirmed with a digital EPT brand test as well . I 'm 13 DPO and my period was due in 1-2 days . I did test earlier with these pregnancy tests and all tests were negative until today ! ! I recommend these tests - accurate and quick/clear results .	1
I have a 2 year old who still does n't sleep through the night . Since I was still nursing and periods were n't SUPER regular I would test around the time I get my period every month just to BE SURE there was no way I was pregnant . I really felt a calm seeing that negative every month . Crazy I know . Well , Feb 4th I got a positive . A definite positive . Pretty shocking since we were using protection and I thought it had to be wrong . I tested and tested and went to the doctor . It was n't . Anyway , I ca n't believe I got a positive so early . This test is super sensitive and truly is & # 34 ; a first response & # 34 ; . Due in October and while I still ca n't believe I 'm having another ... this product did the job it was intended to do ! Great price too ! Especially if you subscribe !	1
we try it with my wife , about 6 days before the missing period.and it came positive , even , we did it in the afternoon , not in the morning as it is suppose to be done.we did it again , the next day in the morning , and possitive again.so we decide to go in blood , just to be sure and it was positive.if you want a fast response go ahead for this , is amazing , how good they are .	1
I used these exclusively with my first two pregnancies . Fortunately , it did not take us long to get pregnant , so I did not end up forking over more than the price of one package each time . For my third ( and current ) pregnancy , in an effort to save money , I bought the Wondfo tests , and purchased the FRER to confirm the positives that I got from the Wondfo . Wondfo detected the pregnancy at 9 DPO ( 6 days before my expected period ) , and did a good job at tracking the subsequent hormone build-up . I ca n't imagine spending the money on FRER if it takes repeated attempts to get pregnant , when there are so many cheaper alternatives out there . That said , I trust FRER 's results , which is why I bought it to confirm the Wondfo results . As I am rating the product itself ( and not the price ) , It gets 5 stars .	1
I purchased this test about a year or so ago because I thought maybe I was pregnant . Turns out I was n't and I had 2 extra tests left . 5 months ago I had a feeling I was pregnant again because I had missed an entire month of cycle and I was feeling weird . I took the last two in the box and they both came out positive . My sister stated that because my room is overly warm in the summer and the fact that they were sitting for so long it may have been condensation leading to the positive test , so I went out and got ClearBlue . Turns out I was pregnant since the digital backed it up . I am rating this a 4 because of the fact that the information was correct in the test . I knocked off a star because these type of tests , depending on the weather and how long it 's been in the weather , can sometimes give you false information . In my experience the digital tests have been tried and true . However , this is the cheapest if you go to Walmart to get the test so for someone on a budget this is perfectly acceptable . I took 8 different tests because I did n't believe the first 3 , so I was overly thorough and they all came out positive . However , I am not sure if I personally would have used this test on it 's own and truly believed the response . It 's all a matter of personal taste however , so I see no more reasons to not buy other than the one above .	1
Great brand , great product , affordable , reliable . Will always get this brand . Happy with this product . I know I can trust this brand	1
When we were trying to get pregnant I bought a 3 pack thinking I would need all 3 . Nope ! We got pregnant the first month and knew right away thanks to these tests . They are easy to read and work fast . Price was great compared to Walgreens and Target . Shipping was fast and discrete .	1
Very sensitive , very accurate product . An excellent value for the money compared to buying at your local pharmacy . I highly recommend this item for prospective parents !	1
These tests were accurate , I think that 's all you can really say about pregnancy tests . And all you need , right ? They worked !	1
yes , this is great for fast results and accurate , the lines are easy to see and no guessing games , would purchase again	1
I used First Response for all 3 of my pregnancies . They give you accurate results and early . I just found out I am pregnant with my third and I have n't even missed my period yet . I used the First Response ovulation predictor last month and I had a feeling it was a success . I used 2 of these on Friday the 10th and Saturday the 11th , got 2 lines on both . My conception date was May 31st . Granted I know it 's early and things can happen , but the point here is that this pregnancy test gave me accurate results and very early . And everyone knows , false positives are almost impossible . I highly recommend these ! !	1
I ordered these as they are a whole lot cheaper than what they sell in the stores . 3 tests for 11 bucks ? ! I & # 8217 ; ll take it . They shipped super quick to me which is another plus . The best thing though ? I took this test at around 11dpo . Got a faint positive . I went to the lab the next day to get my blood drawn . Came back negative . This test was able to catch a positive before the lab & # 8217 ; s levels could . It was only a qualitative so I don & # 8217 ; t know what exactly my levels were , had to have been lower than 20miu ( the lab & # 8217 ; s levels ) . Had to go back the next week and of course , got a positive . So I & # 8217 ; m pretty impressed with these tests .	1
The tests came quickly . Ordered them Saturday and arrived Tuesday , I was especially impressed because Monday was a holiday . The tests are easy to read . Individually packaged , clean and convient , they even came with a free ovulation test ! Recommend them , super affordable and well worth it .	1
I got a positive reading 5 days before my missed period and the line was pretty dark . I highly recommend this pregnancy test . The other ones on the market are n't as sensitive . It is a good value on Amazon too .	1
Had no problem with it , easy to read and work like any other early pregnancy tests . Honestly , if your HCG levels are strong enough any prego test will give you a good result so I do n't see why people blame the test I found it to be accurate for both my pregnancies . Used if 5 days before lady flow was due to arrive and I knew she would n't be visiting this year : )	1
Glad I was n't pregnant . Got my period several days later . I guess I was stressed and this test made me feel less stressed and I finally got my period . Since it was the same price as walmart and included shipping too so I got it . I always compare prices lol . Recommend .	1
Always works very accurate for me . I 'd say it 's a good price . But then again any other ones works accurate for me too .	1
These are great and I have had great success with them . In my first pregnancy I got a positive before a missed period . I have been trying to conceive again and I just a got a very bright positive three days before a missed period , confirmed by a very faint line on another brand . It 's the best !	1
easy to use and is more sensitive than some other brands so it does indicate earlier if you are pregnant . I would prefer the digital display but the lines were still easy enough to read .	1
Got a positive about 2 days before my missed period . Good enough for me ! I got a positive with these much earlier with my first child but every cycle is different so you ca n't be too critical .	1
So far so good . I have n't had any problems with these tests , but I have n't been actively trying to get pregnant yet . So if you are just checking to see if you are or are not pregnant , these worked fine for me .	1
After trying 3 different types of varyingly priced pregnancy tests , First Response tests are the only ones that detected my pregnancy at 6 weeks . I highly recommend these tests to anyone who wants to know early on if they are pregnant or not . Love , love , love !	1
Easy to use pregnancy tests . Love the 3 pack because lots of women , myself included , take multiple tests just to be sure ! Will definitely buy again in the future and hope for a positive result next time I use these : )	1
good , just like the one you would get at the pharmacy ... arrived early , no complaints.Sorry , the rest of message is fill in to make it to the new rule by amazon of at least 20 words .	1
As I have never really gotten a positive , I do n't know how soon they detect pregnancy but I get my negative results pretty quickly ; ) I know save them for the time when I need a backup test because of pricing .	1
I do n't love it because it is very expensive . But , it is accurate . I used a generic brand from Amazon as well and got the same results , so if you want to pay for packaging and less tests , this is the product for you ! But , I will say , I do feel better with the brand recognition , so if that is important to you , then yes , I can tell you this product works .	1
I bought these at the drugstore except the one I bought had a free pregnancy test enclosed . I started looking at reviews for the cheaper test strips and more expensive digital monitors . There were some concerns about accuracy for both of these when compared to OPK sticks , and I have come to the conclusion that I 'm going to `` stick '' with these for several reasons:1 ) Accuracy . I can tell when my body is ovulating ( I get that I just want to jump out of my skin moody feeling of just wanting to bite my husband 's head off , irritability , middle achyness , etc. ) . When I test these strips against my own experiences they are dead on . Some of the reviews have stated that they are inaccurate based on having a faded line one day , and nothing the next , and this is my experience except when you stick with it . I did eventually get a positive result with two dark lines . Reading it can be tricky at first but you eventually get the hang of it . I 'm not a doctor , but I have read that the ovaries put out progesterone in `` pulses '' and it gradually builds in your system . If the ovaries are also putting out estrogen and LH , this could operate the same way , hence getting a faded line one day , nothing the next , a few days later faded line , and then boom ! ... the double dark lines . Note that LH may stay in your system for a couple of days . I did a little experiment this month and found that I got double lines 3 days in a row , and the fourth day a faded line . So , the more you can test ( and listen to your body ) to catch the LH surge the better.2 ) I love the convenience of using these . I 'm not a person that likes a mess , so you can pee in a cup , dip it in for a few seconds and then take it out , put on the plastic cap and wait . I do n't enjoy putting my pee on the counter , so this is really nice . Also , if you can not wait for the results you can take it with you . I have done this a few times , especially when traveling . I used one in the airport bathroom ( took a dixie cup with me ) and presto ! 3 ) My only complaint is the expense . I 've paid anywhere between $ 14-19 in a store for 7 strips plus a pregnancy test . This can get pricey if you test a couple times a day like I do . I wish they sold a bulk package.All in all , I want something that is accurate and these seem to do the trick .	1
This is the only ovulation test that works for me.Note : Make sure that you do n't test your first pee of the day . Test your second , as long as you only have one or two cups of coffee , or whatever you drink in the morning that 's not water . Also , you have to try to wait as close to four hours as you can from your first pee of the day . Then , your reading will be more accurate.Regarding coffee , Google how horribly caffeine is for fertility . A recent study showed that it 's not cilia that pushes the egg through the fallopian tube , it 's a group of cells that contract the tube and push the egg along . In mice , caffeine inhibited that . The study said that 's only one reason they know of now . They know it really affects fertility , but they still do n't know the entire reasoning behind it . I digress ...	1
Accurate readings , but I hate deciphering whether the lines were darker/lighter/even . I prefer ClearBlue 's easy-to-read system in comparison to this one .	1
It works , that 's all I got ta say . I had irritation for days after sex for some reason , itchy , burning ... ..not sure why . I bought some of this and it brought me instant relief . A nice thick cream with little to no smell .	1
this is my first occasion to use this product and I found it was easy to follow the instructions for application . I would advise anyone who uses the cr & egrave ; me to wear disposable gloves as it speeds up the application . Thank you very much .	1
You 've been out camping in the woods for 3 days without a shower or a clean change of underwear - and your nether regions are ablaze and itching . Do you cancel your camping trip and ruin everyone 's trip ? Well , that would be my choice - but then again , you want to commune with nature , too - right ? Stick a tube of this in your first aid kit for just such a situation . When parts are itching non-stop , it 's hard to think straight , much less enjoy yourself doing anything - sleeping , eating , driving , etc . The Maximum Strength formula helps to extinguish the flames of pain coming from your ... uh ... parts until you can get back to civilization and/or a trip to your doctor to make sure you did n't accidentally wipe with poison ivy leaves while camping .	1
These are great ! They never dry up and my girlfriend remarked that she noticed a big difference . They slide a bit but if you are careful and check on it every so-often no problem .	1
When you do n't feel them , its all the better . These are great . Your hardly know that they are there and they are still very effective . Very sexy and safe . Better for people who have a latex allergy .	1
I already raved somewhere about these ... . they are JUST AMAZING and so far ca n't seem to find anything betterdo n't like pills so these are very thin and compared to regular ones are night and day and they do n't smell after like Trojans ... you get used to how they look ... but again , we disagree on the smell . I do n't smell them but my other half does.these are the best we 've tried so far ! just amazing ! ... .they 're hard to open but totally worth the price and the effort . He loves them , definately the best out there that we 've tried . They 're not slimy ... .will order again !	1
These condoms feel great , but have a tendency to pull off when removing after sex , so you must be careful . They are the closest thing to feeling natural . i will definitely purchase again	1
Pros : I hate condoms , and I love these . They are a little weird when you first open them up , if you do n't know what to expect . Honestly , the smell is pleasant , and reminds me of kind of a leathery fruity woodsy smell . They are a little roomy when they get warmed up , which adds to the feeling of there not being anything there . For a while , I was just certain they would break at any moment because I figured an animal membrane could n't possibly be that strong , but they are super tough . Fill one up with water and you will see what I 'm talking about . I went off hormonal birth control a while ago , and have been using these instead . Again , they do n't protect against STDs and should not be used by anyone but monogamous couples . Best condoms ever ! Con : expensive , but I honestly would pay more for them if I had to .	1
We buy band aids , but find each box has a few large ones and a bunch of small ones . This box has a bunch of larger size band aids that are very helpful for ailments . Great selection . This is a good product that was as described in the Amazon description . It arrived on time , was well packaged , and had no damage .	1
My my ! These come in all the sizes you could POSSIBLY want.They cover , and stick on through sweat , grease , and a quick shower .	1
Not much to talk about with bad aid brad bandages , works as expected , I will not but knock off bandages , I like the quality of the real thing .	1
I 've tried much more expensive nipple guards for running and they do n't work any better than these . I sweat a lot and these stick like glue . In fact if there is any issue with them it 's how hard it is to get off after a run .	1
A good variety of sizes , and best of all , a lot of them . A useful medicine cabinet repository , and a whole lot less expensive through Amazon . These also are clear ( mostly ) , and adhere well , even staying on when wet .	1
Great way to buy Band-Aids ! All the sizes are usable ! We go though a lot of Band-aids so I was happy to see this size available !	1
I cut myself rather nastily at a friend 's house and he gave me one of these . They seal tightly and absorb blood and fluids to allow natural healing . You just put the bandage on and leave it ; no changing dressings . Although they 're expensive on a per-each basis , because you do n't change dressings , they may be less expensive than fabric or plastic bandages per injury . I bought some for car , home , and suitcase , so I 'll have one wherever I might need it .	1
This is a great box of band-aids that has everything you could possibly need . The band-aids stay on and do their job protecting cuts . I would recommend this box of band-aids for your first aid supplies .	1
I keep these spread out throughout the house and vehicle med kits , they provide the quality expected from Band-Aid . Provide good adhesive and keep various sized wounds covered .	1
WOW ! these bandages are HUGH . Much larger than I expected , I like them , they are great- they 're actually extra large , have n't use them yet but , they 're band-aids you do you expect .	1
love the variety and they are very sticky unless you soak them with water . what else can you want or expect ?	1
Papercuts , knee scrapes hurt more when they are exposed to air . Sure , you do n't need a bandaid for those , but they make them hurt less , so why not ?	1
Band-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandages , Sheer , 80 Count ( Pack of 2 ) is great for us . we use a lot of bandaids around here .	1
I first used these strips to cover carpal tunnel release surgery sites a year ago . I was so pleased with their performance that I now use them wherever I need a waterproof sterile covering .	1
decent set of bandaids . lots of different sizes and types . sticks well and doesnt peel off randomly . very durable . would recommend to anyone looking for bandaids	1
With numerous grandchildren diving about the house and yard there are plenty knocks cuts and abrasions to empty one of these boxes in double quick time !	1
This is a good assortment of medium quality bandages to use often when needed . It is not cloth as with the higher end ones but still quite comfortable and very sticky to hold well . We use one of these every few months and it does the the job well . Always handy for a small cut here and there doing chores .	1
i gave these to my friend who runs a warehouse and his guys love it ! easy to apply and priced right .	1
I 've tried the other brands , including the gimmicky ones ... .but I keep coming back to Band-Aid . In the end , they work the best , regardless of which variety of Band-Aid that you choose ( e.g . fabric or plastic , medicated or plain , clear or flesh-colored ... .Flourescent colors and stars and stripes may attract the kiddies , but regular bandages from Band-Aid are the most effective and the best value for the money ...	1
I 've used many brands of band-aids , but these seem to do the best . They are clear and the gauze pad does not stick . I 've had them on for several days at a time before they finally come off with water , but that is usually at about the time they need to come off . I 'll be buying them again and would recommend them .	1
good assortment and good price we use alot of bandages so this was a good deal .	1
The band aids work well but there is little variety in this `` variety '' pack . mine was almost all small band aids and a few large ones . when they say `` assorted sizes '' it seems more like someone picked up a handful of whatever and there them in . I 'd just buy what sizes I thought I 'd use most because I really did not even want the small ones , so I should of stuck with just buying the large ones in a pack .	1
I use these mostly . I find the fabric bandages stay wet . Those heavier sports strips are good though , but I do n't always want such a heavy bandaid , so these are good for general use .	1
this is expensive ! but well woth it . if you have a bobo on yor hand ! this is the band aid to use . wash your hands all you need to . and this band aid . will stil be thear . ( worth every penny . ) realy works .	1
This particular size is hard to find in pharmacies , stores , etc . Great little bandaid for small cuts or to cover up smalll\ skin lesions . Super value at that price for a 3 pak of 50 each !	1
I ride a lot in the woods and keep getting scratches on my legs and these will cover a lot of them and stay on well .	1
I always buy Band-Aid products because they are tried and trusted . They have been around for years . These ones hold up well in water too .	1
First of all , let me say that whenever I tried a brand other than `` Band-aid '' I was disappointed . That said , I believe this particular style is the best I have found . When I was having a lot of trouble with eczema on my right hand , I needed to wear band-aids on two of my fingers , to protect them so they would heal . All the other bandaids either had fabric that began to unravel almost immediately or the cushion area was too small or the length of the bandaid was too short . This one is just right . The whole bandaid is 2 7/8 inches long . The cushion part is a quilted 1 inch by 1 inch square and has a nice thickness to it . Also , the actual fabric of the bandaid is a sort of rubber-plastic , so it does not unravel and it stays on pretty well . It is water resistant . Buy this one for your general use . You will probably save money in the long run .	1
I 'm very pleased with these bandages and enjoy the variety pack since cuts come in different shapes and sizes , too . I recommend these to everyone .	1
Is there much to say about bandaids as far as their quality ? Just like you would buy at the store . The box , however , was a bit damaged which made me sad , but the bandaids were fine .	1
These bandages were a great price for this name brand . It was an undamaged box with genuine Band-Aid bandages . It was shipped super fast , and was a great price without the hassle of coupons for this many boxes . If you are and & # 34 ; outdoor & # 34 ; family , or need a load of bandages , this is a good deal without having to shop around wasting time and gass .	1
I could n't bring myself to count all 280 bandages in each of the two packs of Band-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandages I ordered , but I did confirm that all stated sizes were in each box in what appears to be the correct distribution . This is a heck of a lot of bandages , but I have two sons and I like to be prepared . I will re-stock our auto and personal first aid kits from these large boxes as needed . I did not carefully compare prices for these , and I suspect a local Costco or BJ 's might have better per-bandage prices , but this was a painless way to stock my medicine chest .	1
First , you do n't buy specialized bandages like this very often . I think the last pack lasted well over five years.But these new ones , yikes ! The adhesive - able to stick for days ( thru showers ) , the breathe-ability of the flexible and comfortable material , the ability of this tiny bandaid to apply pressure when needed . Latex-free and hypoallergenic ( I 've had bad reactions to the adhesive in bandaids , not just the latex ) . This stuff blows away other ( more recent ) models of bandaids in my medicine cabinet.It reminds me more of surgical tape with a gauze pad fixed to it . Except my surgical tape is n't this quality.Where can I find this stuff in other sizes ?	1
With our large family and all of us doing lots of sports - ok , the kids do sports and I 'm just a klutz - I like to keep a large assortment of bandages in the medicine cabinet . I like this huge 280 count box because it has some of every size in one place . Having a separate box for each type of bandage takes a lot of space . Most of these are the plastic kind , although it does contain some of the fabric kind . We do n't use many of the little tiny square ones , but they 're nice to have on hand for blisters or small cuts . The biggest ones are perfect for knee or elbow scrapes . The fabric ones are perfect for fingers , since the bandage is tougher.Bandaid bandages stay put on the injury , unlike some of the cheaper ones I 've bought . Every medicine cabinet should have one of these boxes , ready for any emergency .	1
Save money and time when ordering here . My two young daughters need a lot of bandaids in summer . These save us a lot of money and time to go to CVS . The same quantity as those sold in CVS with lower prices .	1
Very good to have on hand for scrapes & cuts . Is part of Basic home & car first aid kits .	1
Band-Aid enjoys a proud tradition of manufacturing all types and shapes of bandages used to cover wounds people sometimes get when they accidentally nick themselves with scissors , a knife or a can opener . I use these with complete satisfaction and I can tell you why.The assorted sizes in these boxes mean that different size band aids can be applied to different size wounds . After all , you would n't use a 1 inch by 4 inch band aid to cover a minor wound after a splinter has been removed , now would you ? In this package you get smaller bandages that cover just the tiny areas -- or the larger areas where you may have a cut from a knife while you were chopping onions or peppers or something.These bandages also offer an excellent feature : they stay on even when wet . Therefore the band aid can be applied to your skin wound much more effectively than a regular band aid.Two caveats : If your wound is really bad , seek out a doctor or even consider going to an emergency room if you believe the situation warrants it . You may also have to wash the wound area with soap and water before you apply the bandage if you think you need to do so . Moreover , Amazon also correctly notes that the product packaging contains latex -- if this is a concern for you , you may want to choose another substitute product recommended by a physician.Overall , Band-Aid scores a huge plus in my book with these bandages . The price is reasonable for all that you get -- and after you buy them they stay fresh and usable for quite a while to come .	1
One problem I 've always had with regular bandaids is that they were occlusive dressings which may absorb drainage but also caused the wound to become raw from enzymes in the drainage . These bandaids are open on the sides so they absorb drainage but also allow the wound to breath , which promotes healing faster . I have a skin condition that requires lots of bandaids , and these are the best ones I 've found to promote healing and decrease pain .	1
Not much else to say about it , they stay stuck on and work great . hopefully i do n't have to use them very often LOL	1
WONDERFUL PRODUCT - ORIGINAL BAND AIDS - NOT A BARGAIN BRAND . THIS ITEM IS EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS IT IS AT SUCH A GOOD PRICE . SHIPPING WAS QUICK AND EASY. ,	1
Great product . It comes in handy for scraped knees . The perfect size for large cuts . They stick to the skin well . Highly recommend this product .	1
This was a good buy . It has all different sizes . Same great quality as all the other band aids . There are no unnecessary sizes , which I am happy with .	1
This is a hard-to-find size unless you buy a variety pack ( which never contains enough of them ) . And I 'm glad that Band-Aid offered them at a reasonable price ... ..some of the generic brands do n't stick nearly as well .	1
I am a diabetic and use a pen once a day . I was looking for a product to mark injection sites so I knew when to give the next injection . This product works great . Small and stays on when wet .	1
As a male runner loose fitting clothing chafes your nipples on long runs and can cause bleeding , a couple of small bandages can help to alleviate this situation . The bad thing with the Band-Aid brand is that they are square so if you have a hairy chest these can be a bit uncomfortable.I would also suggest checking out CVS brand spot bandages as they are round and even less expensive .	1
and lots of them kids love them . I do like the band aid brand as they do stick and stay on longer than the ell cheapos .	1
An old time product well improved . This are great when you can see through them and they do n't stick out on your hands much . They 're strong and the adhesive is great . Love them .	1
Sticky , flexible , clear , has padding . Not much else I could ask for in a bandage . Even sticks through and after a shower . Pretty great !	1
No one complains that we do n't have band aids n the house . Except I will say its missing the band aids for knuckles . We had to buy those separate from our CVS . Our son plays basketball and scraped his knuckles and we bought the knuckle kind so he could still play and they stretched nicely . Other than that , this box is great !	1
I am very happy with this purchase and I would definitely recommend them ! The convenience of having an assortment of sizes is wonderful ! I really hate it when I do not have the correct size band aid when I want it . Now , that wo n't be a problem .	1
My sandals will sometimes rub blisters . I do n't like to wear bandaids or corn cushions , too freaking obvious . This band aid blister cushions are pretty close to perfect . They are flesh toned , ( if you are beige colored , any darker skinned and they will be obvious . Makes me wonder , why do n't they make these in different skin tones ? Sounds like a great idea to me ) and they protect the spots on your feet that are blister prone . I use a ton of these and buy them often . Highly , highly recommend .	1
Nice big box to last a while , like there being a variety of sizes and sticks well to the skin . Satisfied purchase .	1
Works well , easy to tear , does n't hurt skin but is sticky enough to stay when needed ! I use it with my childcare kids ( maybe twice a year ) and would n't dream of using anything else !	1
The tape is light and does not irritate my skin . I wish there would be more tape on the roll .	1
I was very disappointed that the local grocery store and CVS both stopped carrying this tape at the same time . Are they discontinuing it ? It was always more expensive than the other brands ( store brand , NextCare ) , but you got what you paid for . I bought 3 rolls to hopefully last me a while.Unlike competing brands , the Johnson and Johnson cloth tape is:1 . Easy to cut2 . Easy to write on with sharpie , will not bleed and will not fade3 . Very sticky4 . Does not leave adhesive residue after being pulled off5 . Relatively waterproof	1
Gauze Pads ... . What else do you have to say.. They are good quality and we use them in our med kit	1
I recently fell and gouged my leg . It was a nasty cut on my shin , which was 3.5 inches long and about wide . I had trouble finding a good bandage big enough to keep the wound protected . These Johnson & Johnson ; pads were the only ones that worked well and had a reasonable cost . I used them both to clean my wound as well as to keep it covered to protect from being touched by the pant legs . The gauze pads are very absorbent yet provided some ventilation for the wound as well.Photo attached : an individual pad next to the box.They were easy to work with . I attached them to the leg with paper tape . This method was secure and not irritating to the skin.Cleaning the wound after injury is very important . I did not do it quite right and that resulted in an infection , which took several weeks to cure . Here is the wound cleaning procedure that my doctor gave me along with the anti-biotic to cure the infection:1 . Wash your hands thoroughly using plenty of soap and warm water . Rinse and dry with clean towel.2 . Assemble all of your supplies such as cleaning solutions so that you do n't have to move or interrupt the procedure.3 . Remove old dressing by loosening all of the tape . Pull all tape ends gently toward the wound so that you wo n't disturb the healing process by pulling the healing edges apart.4 . When all tape is loosened remove all dressings , one layer at a time , and discard into plastic disposal bag.5 . Pick up a mirasorb gauze sponge by one end and dip it into the cleansing solution recommended by your doctor.6 . Clean wound by stroking gently in a circular motion . Do not scrub back and forth , especially across incision line.7 . Repeat this process using clean sponge until entire wound is cleaned.8 . Pat dry wound using a clean sponge.9 . Discard used sponge in a plastic bag .	1
Hold up well , usuable , that was what led me to this product , as i use these in classes over and over .	1
These pads are soft and very absorbent . Found them to work quite well and are good to have on hand in case of emergencies .	1
I keep these in various med kits that I have around the house and in my vehicles . Quality gauze pad to cover up scrapes .	1
I bought these after having a tooth pulled that would not stop bleeding . I 'm by no means an expert on gauze pads so I wo n't speak to quality etc . I bought the smallest size which was 2x2 inches . If you are having a tooth pulled and want to have some on hand I can recommend these . I did find I had to cut them half in order not cause my 'gag ' reflex to come into play . This may have been because of all the stuff the oral surgeon had stuffed into my mouth and my brain may have had it ! Anyhow , these fit nicely into the back of your mouth when cut in half . I 'm sure since I have three grandchildren under 7 that the ones I did n't use will come in handy at some point too !	1
These gauze pads are very strong and feel very comfortable . I have a clinic where I go through lots and lots of gauze pads to care of wounds . These gauze pads are easy to apply and comfortable even after a day .	1
Well , we just got this in the other day and I had the opportunity to use it today . The gauze is nicely absorbent and it does NOT stick to wounds . Recommended ...	1
I got a burn on my foot , and I need some gauze pads . The local drug stores are very expensive , these day by far the cheapest place to get them from . And you know its top quality from johnson and johnson . You ca n't go wrong with this product .	1
I have Morgellons and have had multiple open lesions all over my body , so having these pads is great since they are n't too large but can be opened up if necessary for more coverage . Add antibiotic ointment and some paper tape or tegaderm to it and it 's great !	1
Johnson & Johnson 4x4 guaze is a great product . I use whenever I need product of this type . They get the job done .	1
I have always used gauze pads whenever I have incured an injury . It helps to keep it clean and from getting infected .	1
These are thick which keeps them from soaking through like most others . They designed well enough to be cut up and not fall apart	1
just need to pay attention and get the right size of gauze for what you are treating . The gauze is excellent !	1
I 'M GON NA DEFINITELY USE THIS WHEN NEEDED BUT THESE PRODUCT ARE JUST AS DESCRIBE ITS GOOD TO HAVE WHEN YOU HAVE WOUNDS THAT NEED CLEANSING .	1
Sterile pads are sterile pads , but if you buy them in the local drug store they will cost you a fortune .	1
Excellent ointment for healing cracked skin on fingers from winter cold , and lips . Great value pack of 6 tubes . Arrived on time with Prime delivery , and in good condition . All tubes had a safety seal around the cap .	1
With my washing machine not working , I 've been doing a lot of hand laundering , as well as washing dishes . ( no dish washer either ) My hands with dry Winter air and harsh indoor heating have become crinkled , cracked and rough.I have a box of hand lotiona and creams and last evening applied this one just before going to bed.It helped very much.Upon awakening this morning , I nearly forgot how dry and parched they had been because they feel so nice and soft.I 'll be using this every night before bed until my skin heals.Wonderful product for chapped , cracked hands .	1
This is the very best for dry chapped lips ! I had tried so many porducts with little help . I used to be a big Carmex fan but this is way better . Also great for dry skin and to help heal a burn .	1
I live in a cold climate and my hands get very dry during the winter . Furthermore , I have a bad habit of biting my lips . I use this product on both my hands and lips , and it 's spectacular with healing - particularly with the lips .	1
I love this stuff ! It does such a great job healing my dry skin . I put it on my hands and feet every night ( especially in winter ) and I wake up the next morning with soft , repaired skin !	1
This was recommended by a Nurse that works for a Dermotoligist and it works great for dry cracked skin fromMichigan 's cold winters .	1
A family member had been suffering with lips so severely chapped that they would crack and bleed on a daily basis - the bottom lip looked like it was splitting in two . This went on for several months . After reading about this product , I purchased a tube : within 24 hours , the pain was gone and the skin was starting to heal over . Within 3 days - after THREE months of no relief and daily bleeding - the lips were completely healed . To say that we are shocked is an understatement , particularly when we read the ingredients , which appear to be primarily mineral oil and petroleum jelly . This is a miracle in a tube , and we are not going to use any other chapped lip products . Highly recommend this .	1
Aquaphor Healing Ointment , 1.75 Oz ( 50 G ) , ( Pack Of 6 ) I have Stage IV breast cancer and recently switched to Xeloda chemotherapy . It works very effectively but a major side effect is `` hand and foot syndrome . '' This means that your hands and feet get dark , somewhat swollen , but mostly very sore and tender and dry . They can crack if you do n't keep them well moisturized . I have tried all kinds of ointments ( including one a friend brought back from Bulgaria ) . This is definitely the most moisturizing . I put it on my feet and then put socks over them . At night , I put it on my hands and then wear cotton gloves to sleep so I wo n't get my bedding greasy . In the process of reordering it , I just read all the reviews and saw that it works wonders for chapped lips ( which I have always had ) and just put some on my lips . Feels great ! Based on another review , I will try it under my eyes tonight . I have discovered that many less expensive products are as good as , and often better , than the very expensive creams sold by cosmetic companies . You just need to know which . Two thumbs up for Aquaphor Healing Ointment .	1
I love this product ! It is not as gooey as similar products , absorbs quickly and is odorless . Best of all ... .it works very well !	1
A few years ago I developed a severe allergy to a cosmetic cream containing Vitamin E. Only the skin around my eyes was affected , but the reaction was so severe , I was strongly attentive when my dermatologist suggested this product for use around my eyes . It is marketed as good for sensitive skin . I have used it ever since with no allergic reaction . The doctor further recommended applying it with a Q-tip for the extra protection of avoiding any possibility of germs from under my fingernails getting in my eyes , causing an eye infection.Warning : for a product marketed to people with sensitive skin , I 'm not sure why the manufacturer included lanolin in it , which is a substance many people are allergic to.You might want to be aware that the key ingredient is petroleum jelly , and this product also contains mineral oil , both of which many people who are seeking out `` natural '' skin-care products try to avoid.I recommend buying this product in small tubes like these if you are n't using it on large areas of your body , because a little goes a very long way.Active ingredient : Petrolatum ( 41 % ) Inactive Ingredients : Mineral Oil , Ceresin , Lanolin Alcohol , Panthenol , Glycerin , Bisabolol .	1
I always have dry lips and am a lip balm junkie as a result . Lip balms almost always do the trick for dry lips , but about once or twice a year , summer or winter ( does n't matter ) , I get a case of very severe chapped lips where lip balms are ineffective . My lips would flake and feel sore , uncomfortable , and dry , and it could take up to two weeks to heal completely . It was so annoying and distracting . No matter what I would be doing ( working , cooking , reading etc ) I would be constantly distracted by the discomfort of my chapped lips.The problem cropped up recently , and I tried everything this time -- Pure Vaseline , various hand and body lotions , Vaseline creamy formula , hydrocortisone 1 % , every brand/type of lip balm I had on hand ( about 8 different types ) , Lubriderm , Eucerin , plus a homemade exfoliating mixture of Vaseline , olive oil and sugar . None of these things worked . Dryness and discomfort would return in short order.So I googled for remedies and kept seeing recommendations for Aquapfor . I went to my local drugstore , bought a tube of it , and put it on right there in the store after purchasing . Right away , my lips felt much better and more comfortable . I kept applying periodically , and by the next morning my lips were almost all healed . In about 24 hours my lips were essentially healed . This stuff is amazing and I am only sorry I never knew about this before.Petrolatum is 41 % of the ingredients , but NO , this is not at all like Vaseline even though it may look and feel like it . I had tried both Vaseline and creamy Vaseline for my severely chapped lips , and neither made a difference . Aquaphor did . So do n't believe the reviewers who say it is the same . The extra ingredients have some way of promoting healing and smooth skin in a way nothing else I have tried does ( at least for chapped lips ) .I also tried this as a nighttime eye moisturizer and it works very well . It 's too greasy to use in the daytime though.I am now a big lifetime fan of this ointment/cream . It 's amazing .	1
I have been using and carrying around this product with me for years . It 's safe , gentle , and dermatologist recommended . I 've used it on my infant daughter 's diaper rash when anything containing Zinc Oxide made her bottom bleed ( she 's allergic to that ) , and it cleared up overnight . She 's 2 now , and we both still use it . I apply a small amount to my dry , bleeding and cracked cuticles at night , and they 're smooth in the morning . It 's also a great remedy for dry , cracked lips . I always keep a tube on me . It 's expensive , but the 1.75 ounce tube lasts a very long time , and goes a really long way . I stick to what I like , and this product absolutely never disappoints ! There is one mistake I made recently I thought I 'd share . I was at a Walgreens looking to purchase more , and chose the store brand over the Eucerin Brand . Big mistake ! ! The store brand product immediately liquefied in a sort of filmy , slimy liquified version of something that 's meant to soothe and coat your lips with moisture . Upon further research I found a few interesting facts ... First , both products do contain the key ingredient of Petroleum ( 41 % ) . However , the Aquaphor brand contains other Inactive Ingredients listed as : Mineral Oil , Ceresin , Lanolin Alcohol , Panthenol , Glycerin and Bisabolol . The `` Store Brand '' lacks the last three I 've listed in the Aquaphor Brand . The difference is quite shocking . Could this be why the store brand is such poor quality as compared to the Eucerin brand ? I do n't know , but I 'll never buy store brand for this product again.Be sure to check labels before you buy store brand to make sure it really is similar to the name brand , otherwise you might find that you 've saved a $ 1 on something that turns out to be a waste of money .	1
I 've been using Aquaphor for a few years now . At first , I bought it cause I was having some rash/eczema issues . But I found that it quickly replaced my regular Petroleum Jelly . I like this type because it 's more hygienic than the tub and it 's convenient from travel . I keep a 3 oz jar in my bathroom . I routinely use Aquaphor on my lips and around nostrils before going to bed.When I have a cold/flu , I keep one in the living room or by the bed to apply constantly to the raw-prone parts ( lips , above lips , nose ) .It 's one of those simple , useful items for a medicine cabinet and purse . Can use on scrapes after disinfecting . Can use to groom eyebrows ( mine are n't bushy anymore , but , ya know ) .I like this a lot . Convenient . The tube is a better delivery method , keeps it hygienic . The tub , while quantity-wise is nice , you got ta dip fingers or a spatula in ( if you 're that mindful ) .Stay well ...	1
Truly the best hydrating cream-eye cream - lip balm that I 've ever used ! I 'm on Retin-A , and if you know the side effects to using Retin-A then you know what I 'm dealing with right now and how you 're not suppose to use any harsh products . Retin-A is making me peel and have some redness and irritation from the use but this product soothed my skin when even Cetaphil cream couldnt . I 've used the other $ 100 jars of worthlessness , and believe me , this stuff will moisturize even the driest of skin.However , some things you do need to consider before buying : This is quite greasy , therefor I wouldnt suggest you use this during the day or with make-up.This lotion tends to get on your bedding 's ... .It didnt seem to absorbed into the skin as well as other top brand lotions or Cetaphil - but it worked better so I 'm not complaining .	1
My doctor suggested this product for a problem on my leg caused by my Diabetes , not a sore just raised bumps , red and ugly .	1
I have used this for years to combat dry skin on my face . Here is why I like it:1 . It goes on clear and works very effectively to moisturize dry skin.2 . It penetrates quickly , so I can wipe it off in a couple of minutes in order to avoid having a & # 34 ; shiny & # 34 ; looking face , but still have moisturized skin.3 . It is more soothing and less greasy than vaseline.4 . Unlike various facial moisturizers , it is fragrance free , so you do n't have any smell after using this.5 . This tube is a convenient size for travel and also to keep in the office.Bottom line : I have tried countless ointments over the years because I have always had dry skin , and this is the best one that I have found.Shop for price . I buy this for less at my local CVS than the price on Amazon .	1
We used to buy the giant tubs of aquaphor , but the smaller tubes are not only convenient , but they are unlikely to get contaminated . We can put one in various places in the house so that they are always convenient . We learned about Aquaphor when we had grandbabies coming over all the time , and now we just like having it for our own selves .	1
I suffer from HS and bought it for this . This is great for itches as well . It numbs the area so you can forget about it , i.e . mosquito bite , etc . I also use it for my edges . After I got my hair braided it was tight and annoying and I am using it for a few days until my hair loosens a bit . I will also use if for my eyebrows when I pluck . Apply first , leave for a few minutes , then wipe . The product should have numbed the area long enough and makes tweezing/waxing less painful . I will buy many times .	1
Only used it once on a boil ; seemed to help . Boil was n't that painful but it may have some drawing properties for some ; good to have something especially for annoying boils .	1
I tore off the cuticle on my thumb and developed a fungal infection . The doctor prescribed clotrimazole and betamethasone ( corticosteroid ) , which never did the trick . I 'd use it for 2 weeks as directed , but when I stopped using it the fungus came back . I went thru this various times before I began to look for alternatives to medicines that were n't working and that were not good for the immune system anyway . This had been going on from October to July.I found the recommendation for this product on EWG 's SkinDeep website , and it is working excellently . I keep my thumb very clean , and I try to keep it dry and do n't submerge it every time I wash my hands . After a little more than one week , I can see the cuticle beginning to come back . I expect this to be a slow process.I do n't buy any personal products anymore without checking on SkinDeep to see if it 's safe and non-toxic . I 'm actually grateful that I got this fungus because I have learned a lot about how to take proper care of finger and toe nails , I NEVER bite my cuticles anymore , and I put witch hazel and argan oil on my nails every day . Subsequently , my nails look better than they ever have before and I 've gotten rid of dry cracked skin on fingers and heels .	1
I purchased a couple of different ones before this one and this one is doing the job of getting my nail and skin looking healthy again .	1
I used it and it works just as stated , and passed it on to others and they tried it , worked just fine for them and they thanked me for telling them . If you have a bad dose you will have to use more that one bottle .	1
If your going to try it and it has a applicator brush in it too . I bought the pen and it lasted about 6 weeks . Tea tree oil is really the best stuff . I am making some progress using both and planning to try kerasil or the vics vapo rub next if this does n't clear it up after 6 months . It cleaned my little toes quick but my big toes just wo n't clear up . They look better but stay yellow - not gross anymore but slight greenish yellow . Getting old is no fun and either is using a dirty shower in a truck stop . Been paying for one slip in doing that for 25 years now but I treat it daily and know I wo n't do the same to someone else .	1
The toenail on one of my big toes was all `` ate up '' with fungus , about three-quarters of the nail starting from the tip . I had tried topical antifungals before , to no avail . My doctor scared me away from taking the oral medication , so I ordered this product . I think my previous treatments did n't work because I was n't trimming the nail back enough . Following the advice of one of the reviewers here , I cut the nail as far back as I could with a pair of serious toenail clippers , then went to the garage , got out my Dremel tool with a mini sanding drum , and sanded the toenail down to the nailbed . ( That was an experience . Wear a dust mask . ) I applied the solution every morning after my shower , and sometimes again at night before bed . I kept applying it , and kept trimming the nail back , and sanded occasionally , and eventually I saw results . It took almost a full year , but my big toenail is finally back and fungus free . ( And I still have about a quarter of the bottle left . ) So it works , but you have to be committed to the process .	1
This is the only thing I 've used that has helped the fungal infection of my big toenail ( which I 've had for 5 or 6 years ) . I use it twice a day in conjunction with Fungisoap and within a few weeks I saw improvement . My nail is no longer thick and dark , and while the infection is visibly still present , it looks much better than it did a month or two ago . I cut my nail down as far as I can and keep it filed down so I can apply this liquid under the nail as well . Right now it looks like my nail may fall off ( sorry if this is TMI ) , but I 'm hoping like others here that will mean I can continue to use this stuff on the skin under my nail . I 'll update this review as time goes by .	1
My nails and cuticles have been so dry and were looking just awful ! Some peeling of nails , but do n't think it was fungus~just cold winter and using bleach to clean while at my daughter 's house with no gloves . Ran across a bottle of this stuff while looking for nail polish , remembered how it had cleared up a toe fungus years ago , and decided to try it on my nails , just to see if it would help . WOWOWOWOWOW ! You would n't believe the change in my cuticles and nails in the last 3 days ! Whatever is in this stuff is just really great for dry , peeling nails , with or without fungus , dry cuticles , and who knows what else ! I may try it on other skin issues now . GREAT stuff !	1
I had a problem from over 40 years ago when they did not have this great over the counter anti fungal stuff . I have been using once a day and making some progress . My toenails had almost totally been destroyed by the fungus and looked awful . I think supposed to use twice a day and if I did would work even better .	1
This stuff works . It takes about a month for you to see real results , but it gets the job done . Goes on easy and is oderless and dries very quickly .	1
I have been using this product faithfully twice a day for about 3 months now , and my infected nail is much clearer than it 's been in years ! I have been to the dermatologist several times for this . I did n't want to take the anti-fungal orally and risk liver damage , so they gave me some other kind of `` nail polish type stuff '' to use and nothing . It did n't work at all . I went through 3 prescriptions of that thinking it just might take time , but I saw no improvement at all.I tried soaking in apple cider vinegar twice a day for months and even spritzing it on and under my nail whenever I thought about it in between , that did n't help either . Insurance wo n't pay for the laser treatments yet , but hopefully soon they will . That only takes one time at the dermatologist office and it 's gone forever . Give that a shot if you can afford it , ( but I ca n't ) .I bought this even though I had heard that over the counter meds do n't work on nail fungus . But I thought I really have nothing to lose . Picked it up at the local grocery store , brought it home and started using it right away . I trimmed my nail as far as I could , scraped out all the gook under there ( like I have always done with all treatments ) , and apply this as far under what remained of my nail as the brush tip would go . I also paint it around the nail and on the cuticle . Really , in just 3 months my nail is almost perfect . Not quite , but I realize toe nails grow painfully slow and I just need to keep doing this until it 's completely grown out . Even after that , I will probably continue another month or 2 just to make sure.I HIGHLY recommend this product . It really does work if you follow the instructions and put it UNDER the nail , around the cuticle and sides of the nail .	1
Works quite well .	1
This stuff lasts a really long time . It is so worth the price . Make sure you put it under your toenail every time . Get that fungus outta there !	1
Product works , it wo n't cure but helps to keep under control , Better then taking prescription , that has too many side affects for this old girl .	1
This funginail must be used for a long period of time . If you stick with it and keep applying it regularly , you will see a difference .	1
Does the job easily by using twice per day . Consistency is important and you do n't want to go backwards , so just stick to the schedule until all is cleared .	1
It works ! The key is you have to be persistent . Apply it twice a day in morning and evening , for a couple of months , then you 'll see the effect.I 've tried another solution also bought from amazon , which did n't really work . But this one works .	1
This is not an overnight 'quick fix ' , so give yourself and over time you will begin to see results albeit slowly .	1
This is great for diaper bags . Easy to grab and use . No messy jar . Those I save for home . Price was good as well .	1
I know many use this for their infants but I had dry flaky skin around my nose and upper lip area and I added vaseline one evening and the next morning the dry flakes were history . I was told by a friend that who has really great skin that she uses the vaseline on her entire face after she splashes a little water on it and it has really made a difference . I did the same but I did get a little blemish on my chin and I 'm usually not prone to acne anymore since I turned 40 . I think I will stick to using it on the very dry areas only .	1
I order many things online that are difficult to find locally . This is one more example . Like the tube for travels .	1
These did the job . These made it possible for me to wear my shoes until the corn could be removed . The best thing is they stayed in place when I put my sock on . I purchased another brand at a local store . They were of no use since they did not stay in place . I wish more came in a package or I should have bought at least 2 so that I could have some on hand as needed .	1
Fast in-tact arrival . Perfect for little toes , especially if one shaved too close for comfort . Sooo glad I made this choice .	1
The foam cushion help to relive the pressure on my toe , but had problems keeping the pad on the toe for a full day .	1
I do n't have a corn I have what you call hammer toe . This is a nice cushion with ought medication on it to remove corns . Just needed something to help pad toe to not feel pain or rubbing .	1
Every year my Lab ( Maggie ) gets some kind of contact dermatitis or allergy on her Neck . Not sure from what . This year I purchased the BFI and the Columbia Powder . I do remember as a kid I think my parents used the BFI . At that time it was in a little metal can . Anyway I use them both and they worked great . Just ca n't say which one works best . They probably both work the same but I would lean towards the BFI because I remember it as a kid .	1
I read all the uses and have only tried it on my dogs ears after an ear crop . First dog to heal the quickest using this ! I 'm sold on it and would recommend it !	1
When I was working , this was a must-have item . And since I worked on my feet , 8 hours a day , I used them along with a simple extra comfort insole . Now that I 'm retired , I do n't need the extra insole to be comfy ... and I can use a pair for a good month where I 'd previously used them by the week when I was working .	1
For around $ 5 , these are good for the money . They 're nothing amazing , but they do the job . I 've been wearing my current pair ( several days a week ) for over a month , and they 're still holding together . So far , I only see minimal wear , so they seem sturdy enough . I imagine the average pair will get a couple months use before needing replaced.I 've had issues with other insoles sliding , bunching up , and becoming uncomfortable , but these seem to `` stay put . '' The material and quality lend to a slight awkward feeling beneath my foot , but it 's nothing to complain about . With lightweight dress socks , you definitely notice a texture beneath your foot , and - as they wear and `` fray '' - you begin to feel them even more.Their `` odor-eating '' qualities are the part that was most disappointing . They certainly contribute to fighting odor , but they have their own `` unique '' odor that seems to result from removing natural odors . While it 's better , it 's certainly not a fresh ... fruity ... smell . = ] SIZING NOTE : As someone who typically wears size 11M Dockers , these fit perfectly without needing to make any cuts or re-sizing to the insoles .	1
I ordered this product and it was shipped within the same day . My product came in great condition and on time . The product is small enough for home use , and can hold a fair amount of needles . It has two different slots for pen needles and regular syringes .	1
I usually use sugar free but this seems works better for me the sugar helps it to work with it . I use it for Irregularity and to help with cholesterol . good price fast service and will order again	1
Dietary fiber is good for you for a number of reasons . I ended up in the hospital a few years ago with acute diverticulitis . I was in there for a week , which just does n't happen in modern times ; hospital stays are now measured in hours . My doctor told me to increase my dietary fiber . Metamucil does that and it tastes ( fairly ) good . I 've been hospital-free ever since . Good !	1
The orange flavor is very orangey and not fake like artificial flavoring . It dissolves after a 10 second mix with a spoon and it tastes so good ! If you leave it for awhile , it will thicken so drink immediately .	1
It 's poop magic . Do you know what a ghost wipe is ? ? It 's when you wipe , and the toilet paper is clean . Like you never wiped . That 's how awesome this stuff is . When I do n't take this stuff , it 's like wiping peanut butter out of a shag carpet .	1
Tang like Metamucil tastes good ; but the first ingredient is sugar.I did not realize the first ingredient is sugar ; but it tastes good . I think of it as a tang ( orange flavored ) sugar drink .	1
This is a brand that I have read over and over that is safe to use during pregnancy . Stomach problems are a reality of pregnancy so I take this twice a day . I love the orange taste and found it actually taste better when I do n't add more than the water required in the directions ; a watery orange taste can be terrible so do n't add extra water.The sugar content is an issue but I do n't make smoothies so using plain psyillium seed husks is not a realistic option for me . This is my best choice for something I will actually use on a daily basis .	1
if you are backed up and want to go metamucil is the product to know ! lol , I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS STUFF ! It 's fast and affective , has n't failed me yet ! love love love metamucil !	1
I like the price for this giant size bottle , its a good way to get the fiber in your system	1
This is the firstime I 've purchased Metamucil with non- Sugar Free . It still works the same as the Sugar free but you have to take lot more in each dosage since it is mixed with sugar . As for the taste , I also like the sugar free . Price is great from Amazon.I 've tried many different fiber supplier and found Metamucil to be the best at great value .	1
A FRIEND WANTED TO KNOW IF THIS WOULD BE GOOD FOR HER SINCE HER GALLBLADDER WAS REMOVED ABOUT 5 YEARS AGO . SHE LOVES IT ! = )	1
may be tmi , but this helped with both of my husband and my lets say output problems ... this regulated us both , yay ! The flavor is actually not bad , kind of tastes like watery tang , much better than many others I have tasted . You just have to be sure that it is mixed well , and drink up immediately , otherwise it becomes a jelly substance .	1
Tastes much better than Walgreen 's generic brand . Not as gritty and tastes better . I always say I 'm drinking Tang when I drink this , and this actually tastes like a weak Tang . It 's almost tasty . Also , I received an awesome price here on Amazon with subscribe 'n ' save and they were also offering a $ 1 coupon .	1
Have used this for many years . Just be sure to drink a glass of water afterwards . Swelling occurs quickly and close your swallowing off . Betty	1
Seven years ago , Metamucil became part of my regular morning routine ... emphasis on `` regular '' ! Had an issue that initially seemed like an stomach virus but required a wonderfully invasive visit to a colorectal specialist to resolve . Yep -- that was soooo much fun . Sitting on a little donut for a couple months of recovery thereafter was just a joy too.Anyway ... the butt guy flat out said that , given what he now knew about my plumbing , Metamucil should become part of my daily routine else I might need to revisit him and his lovely workshop every couple years . Hmmmm ... that was enough incentive for me to run as fast as I could to the local market to purchase that first canister of this excellent product . Two tablespoons in a glass of water is what I have tried to drink every morning since.Is Metamucil the best tasting stuff on Earth ? Nope ... but it 's not bad either . Do you need to stir it well and drink fairly quickly ? Yes ... else it turns into an orange sludge that is not really drinkable . Does it work ? TOTALLY . As other reviewers put it , I concur that the poop process became effortless , smooth and very clean . When I get lazy or am traveling and skip a few days , the impact is fairly dramatic ( not as regular , not as clean , and sometimes get a gassy/bloated feeling ) so I try to keep a good schedule.Smaller canisters of Metamucil are available locally , but the best per-ounce deals seem to be available right here . We just keep track of our supply and order via Amazon as needed , and delivery as always safe and fast.If you are looking for relief in the form of a psyllium fiber product , then I recommend giving Metamucil a try based on my personal experience with it.Highly recommended .	1
something was up with the packaging im not sure what it was but the product seemed to work like hte original	1
I started taking sugar free Metamucil in place of Benefiber in order to get the cholesterol reducing benefit that Benefiber reportedly does not have . The aspartame in the Metamucil gave me headaches , so I had to switch to the sugared variety . The down side to Metamucil is that it does get thick if you do n't drink it quickly . I used to just add Benefiber to my coffee in the morning and it was tasteless , clear and did not get thick . Very painless way to get fiber . But I do find the Metamucil seems to give me a better benefit as far as bowel regularity than the Benefiber did . I do n't like the sugar in it but there does not seem to be a better alternative for me right now.Another reviewer commented on the large container being hard to fit in the cupboard and even harder to hide if you did n't want to advertise your health issues . Buying in bulk for the cost saving does have its down side . Anyway , I keep mine proudly displayed in the cupboard next to drinking glasses so I do n't forget to take it . But it can just as easily be transferred a little at a time into a pretty jar or tin , and replenished as needed .	1
THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS WALT SALE . I AM OK WITH IT . IT IS SAVE TIME TO GO WALMART GET IT BY BUS .	1
For us old farts that want/need regularity , this is the best product on the market . Great in smoothies , but you have to pay attention to the dose !	1
I love this product and hope they never stop making it . It is unique because it is a cream base and not liquid or powder .	1
I searched the web for this item , that I could not find in local stores , or anyplace other than Amazon , and had it in three days . Rather amazing . Hope they continue to carry this item as it is the best product of this type made , but difficult to find a retailer .	1
I have been buying this lotion for 6 years from my grocery store . Usually they cost $ 3- $ 4 each but now none of my grocery stores carry this anymore . I got this 12 pack for $ 26 and free shipping and you ca n't beat that anywhere . This lotion makes it so easy to use my electric shaver without any irritation and it glides with a close shave . Also you need next to very little after shave after using this because it has lotion built in and has a very subtle scent you can use a different after shave lotion or cologne without the 2 scents clashing .	1
After using all types of eyebrow grooming wax to hold down my unruly brows , I had almost given up until I found this gem of a product . My current eyebrow wax was a little too hard and unfortunately would yank out a few hairs with it . In a last ditch attempt , I tried the clubman moustache wax in neutral . Keep in mind that my eyebrow hairs are VERY unruly ( and yes , I am a lady ) and finding something that really works and has staying power had been difficult until now . You only need the smallest amount on each brow because the product is very concentrated . My eyebrow hairs stay in place all day and look better than they ever have . I also like the fact that it dries clear and that there is no build up . It also does n't dry out my skin like other products . Definitely a keeper !	1
My brows tend to go every which way and I 've had to keep them trimmed to look decent . This stuff is wonderful . My brows are fully grown out and this keeps them in place and looking GOOD . Do n't know how it works on moustaches but ladies it is great for brows .	1
Works great for the stash . The only annoyance i have with this product is how dry it goes on . Unlike other waxes , it 's not very & # 34 ; waxy & # 34 ;	1
Was usin this as an eyebrow color filler , but it is a little too messy and it clumps up in spots and then I would have to start all over . I 'm sure it 's great if you use it for its intended purpose . Give it a try ! ! Smells good	1
It does the job , although it does not fix for a long time ! You definitely need to reapply every morning and after you shower or wash your face	1
The wax is good . I find it much easier to apply than the hard waxes and it holds well . The color of the dye is a good match , but I would prefer a true neutral wax . The wax can stain shirts .	1
Smells great ( has a kind of citrus smell ) , has good holding power , but can leave flakes ( small white particles ) in your moustache ( helps to use a hair dryer ) . I recommend Firehouse Wacky Tacky instead .	1
Pinaud puts out a good mustache wax . Creamy but stiff when it sets . I rely on this more than any of the other waxes and creams I have purchased . For extra stiffness I use waxes .	1
this wax is awesome . its soft and easy to apply it drys on clear and will hold my mustache for a good 10-15 hours without me having the fix it.only complaints are that sometimes it irritates my skin or drys it out , and the container it is in normally ends up getting damaged or a hole in it since its metal and will eventually just get a hole in it from squeezing or folding the tube , ussually happens to me when the tube is 50-75 % gone but it will dry out inside the tube fast when it happens . Ive been through about 4 of these in a year and it happened to all of them .	1
This mustache wax is widely considered to be the best available . I bought a tube of Rite Aid mustache wax and it was clumpy and horrible . I will say however that the Rite Aid kit came with a much nicer little comb and a pair of scissors though.Clubman is creamy and goes on without clumping . I think something that needs to be said in these reviews of mustache wax is that you need to buy the right wax for your particular stache . If you are looking for some wax to harden the ends of a handbar , that 's different than wax to stiffen up a part in a bushy stache . I think a creamy wax ( type type ) is better for general conditioning and parting . A harder wax ( like the types found in metal tins ) is better for stiffening.I 'm in the process of growing a handlebar mustache so I need something that will work for both . I do n't think Clubman holds as stiff as some people say . There are better waxes out there if you want a real stong hold . But Clubman is so far working well for me to part a growing bushy stache until it gets long-enough to create a handlebar shape.The comb that comes with Clubman is weak and cheap . Invest in a better comb if you like to comb your stache .	1
bought this product here online because it 's hard to find in the drug store . It 's probably because of the labeling ... & # 34 ; tight & # 34 ; means small or able to get into small spaces . Their labeling methods needs to be reviewed . Good product though , if/when you can find it .	1
I 've been alarmed by the reviews on various sellers ' sites saying they had ordered cylindrical and received tapered . I ordered these in August and did receive cylindrical brush tips , as pictured . The wires are pretty weak , and easily bent , but that 's unavoidable if it 's going to fit into tight spaces . They 're supposed to be changed weekly , and I can generally get a week 's worth of use out of one , despite having some teeth that are both very close , and slightly crooked , so it 's a guessing game inserting the wire at just the correct angle to slide right in.I use a Proxabrush with the conical tip at one end for wide spaces , and the cylindrical one at the other end .	1
perfect	1
Work well in tight spaces , could be longer .	1
The G.U.M . Proxabrush number is 414 , but it has the smallest diameter of any Proxabrush still made and feels like the original number 412 in use ( I used them side by side for comparison ) . For me these work far better than flossing and take much less time .	1
The `` tight '' proxabrush refills are just what I wanted and ordered . They get into most of the small between teeth gaps that the larger brushes do not.My only problems with the tight ones is that the wire is so fine they do n't last very long ( and bend too easily ) and there are still some teeth that tight are still too big to get between.I also ordered `` wide '' only because I could n't find `` extra-wide '' on Amazon.For both sizes , the brushes eventually wear out - getting either shorter or come off the wire , but each one lasts at least a week for my use ( daily ) .	1
These really work well for getting between teeth to remove food . They bend easily and I do n't yet know how many times they will flex before breaking . My expectations are they will work great until it is time to replace the brush . Easy on the gums too !	1
This is a dental hygienist recommended item which is difficult to find in stores . Seems to work well and is intended to assist in cleaning areas between teeth not reachable with a toothbrush and not cleaned well with floss .	1
My mom . She used to use oral b brush filler , but oral b is discontinued . This is about the same size and fits , as another review noted , the oral b brush holder . 6 packs sloppily wrapped in plastic , but the retail package itself is in fairly good condition .	1
With three dental implants , I was told to use this by the endodontist . It used to be easy to find at the drug store , but not any more . I think the original manufacturer was bought out , ( it was once a US manufactured product ) and the manufacture moved offshore..to China . I 'm glad to find it here .	1
These things are wonderful ! I do n't actually massage my gums with them , I use them sort-of as toothpicks . they 're great !	1
I purchased this product thru amazon along with another product because of it 's ease in purchasing . I have gingivitis for the past ten years and my periodontist surgeon recommended that I use this product on a daily basis . You run the rubber tip ( point ) between your teeth and gum line . The white residue you see on the rubber tip is exactly what you are trying to remove . The main areas for this plaque for me are front and back of end teeth . Just rinse off with water after each picking and you can clearly see the results . When the rubber tip starts to curl , then it is time for a replacement . I go the the perio for a deep scaling twice a year and my gums are healthy and have been since my first visit over ten years ago . I also use daily a water pick as well , as prescribed also .	1
We 've used these for years but most recently , they 've found another use in our household . My son has braces and has been using this to get around the braces to dig gunk out of his gum line and the brace brackets . He uses it in conjunction with hisWaterpik Ultra Water Flosser . At our first check-up with the orthodontist , he was told that his teeth look great and he 's doing a great job keeping them clean ! It 's a great tool for getting around without damaging the braces and I continue to use mine as well .	1
This is VERY durable ; it has n't broken in the months I 've had it . ( I forgot to write a review until now ... ) .I had wanted a gum stimulator for quite some time , and I decided to buy this one . it was inexpensive , and it looked legit . Great product for a great price . I am a 100 % pleased customer . When this one gets old or worn out ( it still has n't at all though ! ) , I will definitely be purchasing this exact one again . ( maybe from a drugstore , to avoid shipping costs . But still this product ! ) I also bought refills ( replacement rubber tips ) for when the tip gets worn.Note : For a while I was wondering why the rubber tip felt so hard and stiff ... and nothing on the package said that you have to run it under hot water to soften it up before uses.. that , or I just did n't see it . Then again , it is sorta logical ... but yeah . Run it under hot water to soften it . : D	1
The Butler G-U-M Gum Stimulator really helps people like me who are all thumbs when it comes to using dental floss . My dentist advised me to use this and even gave me two when I saw him recently ; and it is working . Just follow your dentist 's directions and your gums will be healthier . In addition , the tiny spaces between your teeth will be much freer of plaque buildup.Some people have a type of saliva that actually helps plaque to gather and build up in the tiny spaces between your teeth . Because I can not use dental floss well I use this instead to remove any tiny food particles that may be stuck between my teeth at the end of the day . It 's relatively easy in my case : I just insert the rubber gum tip in between my teeth , rub the tip back and forth while pressing backward to go in as deep as possible between my teeth ; and then remove the gum tip to rinse it off . That 's that ! Amazon notes that the rubber tip is latex free in case that matters to you.I highly recommend this for persons like myself who have trouble using dental floss and who want to keep their teeth and gums healthy . However , if you have any questions or concerns whatsoever about this product , consult your dentist before using this because , after all , what 's good for me and others may not be the best way for you.Thanks , Butler ! Great product !	1
My dentist recommended this -- -and he was right . Works great and the price was right -- -funny how things on line can be cheaper the local stores ! !	1
If you really CARE about saving your teeth , THIS is the answer ! My only complaint is how difficult it is to put on the replacement tips , so I buy the whole piece.Less hassle , and Positive Results ! My dentist actually notices the difference !	1
With an angled head like a dental probe , the rubber tipped GUM Stimulator is a handy tool for stimulating the gums , and removing plaque from hard to get to areas , like behind the back teeth . The sharp rubber tip works well in between teeth , and also along the gumline . While it is recommended that the tip be heated before use to soften the rubber , it probably is n't necessary . If the tip wears out or breaks , replacement tips are available.Controlling plaque is a lifelong challenge for most of us , and this is a very helpful tool in the battle . Check your local drugstore for a better deal .	1
My dentist recommended one of these because my gums were a tad inflamed , it is not pleasant felling but has improved my gum health .	1
My family using this robber tips to clean plaque under gum every night before go to bed . Such use protects mouth from cavities on roots , gingivitis or paradantoz .	1
It 's nice they make the replacement tips available . In our throwaway world , it 's rather unique . Oh -- and it saves me money !	1
After using the GUM for two months , my hygienist says that tartar control is improved .	1
Not much to say here , but I like when products I 'm looking at have reviews.These are durable , good , effective ... Basically , they are exactly what you want when you are looking for replacement tips for your gum stimulator . Also , they are inexpensive . I will definitely buy these again when I need more ! Note : They may seem stiff at first , but you are supposed to run them under hot water to soften them before use . It took me a while to figure that out . I think it 's on the package , but I do n't remember.Anyways , good product . 5 stars !	1
These G-U-M Stimulator latex free refill tips by Butler are indeed becoming harder and harder to find in stores and consequently I usually order them on Amazon . Just pull off the used tip from the stimulator and then push the replacement tip onto the head of the stimulator using just a little bit of pressure -- and you 're ready to use it ! People comment that these are great for removing extra plaque that brushing your teeth does n't get at and that it 's a good idea to rub the tip all around the gum -- and I would agree with that . I have used these for a while now ( a few years ) and the difference is very noticeable when I go for a dental checkup . The dental hygienist cleans my teeth in much less time because I use this to remove so much plaque from the edges of my teeth where they meet the gums and in-between my teeth.In addition , my gums have become much healthier ever since I started using these tips and that 's a big plus.I highly recommend these G-U-M stimulator refill tips . It 's cheaper to use these refill tips than to get a new stimulator every time the tip wears out .	1
Compact but not tiny , fits into the toiletries bag I keep in my handbag ... but there 's still space for other items . I love that this order came with two toothbrushes . Item arrived on time and without hassle or excessive packaging . I 'm happy and would purchase from this seller again .	1
It 's very inexpensive and works nicely as a travel tooth brush . I would definitely purchase this again if a need a second one .	1
These used to be easier to find in stores , but after looking around unsuccessfully I finally found them here on Amazon ( where else ? ) . These are great for travel because the wet brush head goes inside the handle after you 're done brushing . You can stick one in your purse and brush anywhere . Reusable , small and light - these get my vote for on-the-go brushing .	1
These are great travel toothbrushes and I recommend them . However ; at the time I was updating my emergency kit and wanted to add a new compact toothbrush . Not to take away from this great product - I found a better one right here on Amazon called the Wisp tooth brush . They are one time use toothbrushes that come with toothpaste attached and weigh nothing . So , if your traveling overseas or somewhere where ounces do n't count these are great and compact enough.If ounces count check out the Wisp toothbrushes you 'll be glad you did . I am now happy I have both and I recommend both for different uses .	1
Had a major oral surgery that required implants and a dental bridge and this Oral-B Super Floss is perfect for helping get into difficult areas betwen teeth . Highly recommend it !	1
This is IMHO the best floss you can get with or without braces . It takes some practice , and when you get it , you will see how effective this floss is . The fabric works very well at removing an incredible amount of gunk b/w your teeth . It will shred if you get it caught on your braces or if you snag it on something but again it takes practice to avoid doing that . I havent been able to find this stuff in stores around my home , usually , its the only hanger thats empty . Annoying so I have had to buy online .	1
It is n't as easy to use as I had first thought , but it does hold , I 'm just to big of a hurry , Time line sometimes makes it difficult to use .	1
Works fine but just does n't last too long . I have found a different product that I like better so I do n't use this any more .	1
First off I would not call this adhesive . It works good to use it at night before bed . I put in warm water till soft , roll it like a worm and sit it in the denture . Close my mouth till comfortable not tight . It feels warm at first and I try not to clamp my teeth or move my mouth much . In the morning dentures come right out not stuck at all . If product overflowed above denture I gently trim it . After that I use my regular adhesive and dentures fit great . You take them out wash and put back in with your reg adhesive for four or five days till the Cushion Grip starts coming loose . Soak dentures in warm water and you can work the old Cushion Grip loose in one piece . I would only recommend for people that have really loose dentures as a temp fix . It does need to be used with reg adhesive because Cushion Grip is not an true adhesive , just builds up and fills in dentures .	1
I need to have mine refitted but i still dont like it when a piece of food gets under the denture , these keep the denture secured to the roof of my mouth and keep food particles from getting trapped in between , i flip mine upside down on a waffer and trace a line a round the denture , trim with sissors , get it wet then apply it pink side down ... ..gets me through the day ! : )	1
I use these every day and they are the best . They are not only soft and comfortable but there is NO oozing , which I hate . The only drawback is that you need to cut them to fit because they are made sooooo HUGE ! Try them ... .I 'm sure you 'll like them .	1
I use these pads all the time for my teeth . They work great . This is the only way I can tolerate my false teeth . I have tried my other products but these work the best .	1
This is exactly what I ordered . I found these can be & # 34 ; cut & # 34 ; in certain ways to make them into lowers too . I have a lot of them to play with . At the moment my mouth is & # 34 ; rejecting & # 34 ; the dentures so it is not as nice as I hope it will be later on . Just what I ordered . I would recommend .	1
I have used this before as suggested by my dentist . It does help with my dry mouth and is an excellent mouth wash .	1
When my ( unpaid ) personal products consultant , James , banged on the door , mumbling something about `` Drymuth , '' I thought he had once again ran out of martini ingredients.I was wrong -- he was asking about dry mouth , and whether I had ever had it . After all , he explained , chronic dry mouth is not only uncomfortable but can interfere with daily activities , can result in , or be a symptom of , more serious health problems , and may be caused by hundreds of different medications and treatments . ( He must have Googled the term . ) So , armed with James ' firsthand experience , as well as information from Biotene 's manufacturers ( see their incredibly informative website at [ ... ] ) we proceed : Biotene is a mouthwash designed especially for symptoms of `` dry mouth . '' ( Again , see laclede.com , an impartial medical website , or your physician for more information ) . In any event , you may wish to consult with a physician because -- as noted above -- the condition may be a side effect of a medication ( as it was in the case of my friend ) or a symptom of an even more serious disorder . Biotene claims ( on their bottle ) that it `` cleans and refreshes and helps in the healing of minor irritation . `` Ingredients include three enzymes and one protein that occurs naturally in saliva ( lysozyme , lactoferrin , glucose oxidase , lactoperoxidase ) , and xylitol for sweetening . Therefore it contains no sugar or saccharin , but you might want to consult on xylitol . Glucose Oxidase and Lactoperoxidase generate `` a constant flow of OSCN ions ( hypothiocyanite ) , a strong antibacterial agent that should always be present in saliva . `` Lysozyme is an enzyme thats attacks bacteria , and lactoferrin binds with iron , thus inhibiting pathogenic bacteria.According to James , the taste is mild , not sugary or overly syrupy , and there is no stinging . A smaller size is available , but you 'll pay much more per ounce . On the other hand , if you 've never tried it before , and ca n't score a physician sample , you might want to try out the two ounce side first .	1
Concerning price , as of 3/26 , Walmart retail stores priced it at $ 5.63 - a suggestion for Amazon , which often has the lowest prices on such things .	1
I like very much . I am thinking they can be more generous with the amount in the bottle vs the cost of it . I would like to find cheaper alternative .	1
My boyfriend started using this everyday after he got home from teaching his classes . He had to lecture for hours at a time multiple times a week and began having chronic sore throats and laryngitis . He swears this stuff kept him from having these problems this last semester . Also , I had a few inner cheek and gum sores last week so I tried his mouth wash. Tastes better and helped heal my sores faster than puting baking soda on it ( my mom 's old remedy ) .	1
After a friend burned some gum tissue on some overheated coffee , a dentist recommended this product , both for its healing properties and overall cleansing ability . As listed above , this product is recommended ( by `` dental professionals ! `` ) for canker sores , gum irritations , denture & mouth sores , orthodontic irritations , mouth burns , and cheek bites ( I 'm not sure what the latter is ) . I tried a little , and the taste was pleasant and the liquid nonirritating . There is a mild foaming action as well . Use ONLY as directed by a dentist or other knowledgeable health professional .	1
I 've been using this for years and its getting harder to find the larger size ( 16oz ) . Cleans without the burn that so many mouthwashes have .	1
Works great to quickly heal and slightly numb any mouth irritation or sore . Ever injure your gums while brushing your teeth ? This will help heal those unfortunate scraps fast . Its refreshing and has healing effects . It is a bit foamy but that is the part that makes me feel that its doing its job .	1
For me , I discovered that I had rather thick tartar on my bottom front teeth and just some tartar on the rest . Since it was a while since I had my teeth cleaned at the dentist , I decided to try this first so my next cleaning would not take so long and be so painful . Hate to get my teeth cleaned because the pick hurts my gums and makes them bleed , having to leave my mouth open so long ... You probaly get the picture.Results for me : So I followed the instructions and did the rinsing TWICE a day due to my heavy buildup of tartar . After just about 10 days , I was brushing and a big clump of tartar ( seemed large to me ) in my bathroom sink ! After I finished brushing , I placed my dental mirror and noticed that lots of tartar was GONE ! And where the tartar was , shiny white teeth showed through.And I am still using it and much of the thick tartar is gone ! And I can not see any of the other tartar from the other teeth , so I think all of that is gone ! **PLAX really works , however , keep in mind that this is my own results , but I wanted to let you know that I had a heavy tartar buildup and this works for me.Highly recommend PLAX !	1
I like always have to take good care of my own teeth.I did a little research like I always do , and found I wanted to try this mouthwash , however it is hard to find this available at any store : ( But after searching and doing my homework I found it at : www.drugstore.com/A store I highly recommend , I do all my shopping for items that you would so at that store online.Getting back to the mouthwash , I ordered it because I had heard so many good things about it , things not all mouthwashes do , you see therefore not all are equal.It has a nice taste , I hate the other ones that make you feel like a rocket went off in your mouth and is so strong and zesty ! This one is pleasant , and nice.I suggest you try this . I just wish it was more available , I worry they will discontinue it . So you might want stock up on this if you like it . Yes & # 34 ; note to self & # 34 ;	1
It 's hard to find Plax nowadays . Must have been a marketing stumble by the manufacturer . For me , Plax always results in less scraping during dental visits .	1
okay i was very skeptical about this at first , but after i tried it , it seemed to help me cure gingivitis ! and plus it softens up tartar buildup so you are actually brushing away hard tartar without the dentists need ! Amazing ive been using this for about a week now and 1 week ago i had a small tartar formation and today its reduced by a large percentage ! i freaking love Plax this will put those cheapskate dentists out of business ! Listerine and Crest despise products that actually help the teeth get rid of plaque and tartarall Crest and Listerine can do is just give you a `` tartar and plaque fighting solution '' but Plax actually removes alot of plaque buildup and dissolves tartarof course it doesnt say it dissolves tartar on the product but you have to use logic , tartar comes from fossilized plaque or plaque builduponce you get rid of plaque you have raw access to tartar if you have raw access to tartar its only a matter of time until its all gone5 stars.oh its a prebrush rinse use it before you brush	1
These are perfect for what I need them for . They have sunscreen in them , they relieve dry lips , and they smell good .	1
I work outside all year long . I have always depended on this product for relief on my lips . Always does the job . Great Product	1
I like this better than the waxy sticks , like Chapstick . It really nourishes the lips . I keep a tube in the kitchen , my purse , in the car , in the bathroom in the bedroom . My lips get really dry in MN and this does the trick .	1
I 've tried them all . Natural Ice is one of the best , and MUCH cheaper than many others . The cherry flavor fades quickly so you 're NOT tempted to bite or lick at your lips . It goes on smoothly which is important when your lips are chapped and dry . Your lips respond almost immediately . There is a slight tingling when you put it on , which is the medication going to work . I bought one dozen in January , and I bought 2 more today . That fact alone says a lot.Caution : Be careful if you get it on your fingers not to rub at your eyes . It will sting .	1
I ca n't add much to what the & # 34 ; most-helpful & # 34 ; , 5-star reviews have said , so I 'll keep it short . I work outdoors 8-10 hours a day in all conditions- sun , wind , heat ( 90 's ) , cold ( single-digits ) , and I swear by this stuff . This is one of those products that , once you try it , you 'll never go back to ChapStick or most other brands .	1
My family buys this is in bulk ! The sad thing is that no drugstore in town sells this so as far as I know the only way to purchase it thru Amazon . Unlike Chapstick the Natural Ice does not have an over powering aftertaste . It lasts longer than expected and when my lips are actually chapped I can Natural Ice provides instant relief as well as heals them.Would never think of using another brand .	1
I love natural ice . Maybe because of the way it tingles on my lips , maybe because it works even when chap is the worst . I love this product and use it constantly when I am in dry climates . Highly recommend it	1
Had to buy in bulk , but for the money , they 're great . Wish they still sold them in stores . Could use a little more moisturizer in it , but works really well .	1
Goes on smoothly , no tugging on the lips . Slightly medicates so it MAY cause a slight tingling when you put it on . Soothes the lips , protects them from the sun and wind , helps repair damaged lips . I highly recommend them .	1
So my lips tend to get really chapped in the winter time as well as my hands bleed sometimes from being chapped . I hate the way that chapstick and lotion feels so I usually just let it go . But when my knuckles bleed , it 's time to put some lotion on . I tend to wait until it 's too late to put moisturizer on . Anyways , I bought 1 stick of this stuff for 3.00 on ebay and you can get 12 sticks for 15 dollars here on amazon . I did n't need that many , plus I wanted to test it before buying that many . This stuff is pretty good . I was looking for a chapstick that gives you that cooling relief to let you know it 's working and soothes the lips . It gives a normal amount of cooling relief and I like it . The smell is very similar to chewing tobacco mint flavored . It 's not too strong but you notice it when you first put it on . It also has SPF 15 so in the summer at the beach this stuff will be great . I read all the great reviews here on Amazon and needed something with that cooling relief so I tried it out and I 'm glad I did . I am still searching for Aveeno 's Cooling Relief Lip Balm because that stuff is amazing and worked very well , but this is a good substitute and probably a lot cheaper . This stuff lasts longer than the regular chapstick I think and it 's easier to put on I think . Either way if you have really bad chapped lips , do n't wait to buy this stuff , you wo n't regret it !	1
I have used this product ( lip balm ) for a long time , and I am extremely satisfied with it , because it has SPF15 and menthol . That is why I ordered this product again.The shipment arrived sooner than expected and the product is undamaged . I was keeping my fingers crossed because the climatic condition for the past few days has been extremely hot . Said and done , the lip balm did not melt.I , highly recommend , NATURAL ICE MENTHOLATED SPF15 Lip Balm for every one for daily use.Thank you , people at NATURAL ICE and thank you , AMAZON.SincerelyKJ Kumar	1
Bought these after reading multiple excellent reviews . I work outside and CONSTANTLY have chapped and cracked lips , that peel and bleed . Chapstick , Carmex , etc ... work for me , but not for long . Seems like I 'm continually applying the balm . So , I hunted and hunted and hunted for the BEST , and came upon Natural Ice . A few months of using the product , I 'm hooked . The balm seems to stay on my lips longer than other brands , not needing reapplication every few minutes . My lips are definitely less chapped and painful .	1
I really like this balm , my lips get very dry all the time or I also like to pick on them , but having something on stop me from doing that , plus this one smells nice , and stays for a while . I totally like it . good thing I got 12 of these.. awesome..	1
I need to use a lip balm , of sorts , all the time . I prefer medicated and when I found this and used it , I was pleasantly surprised . I had not used it before ; this is the only product , of this nature , I will use . I like it better than any other product ( s ) I 've used in the past . By far , this product works better . The pricing is the best I 've found , too . Great product , well worth a try !	1
Love ! Love ! Love it ! Feels GREAT ! Cool feeling on the lips . Reminds me of the `` big name '' brand that 's been around forever . Good stuff .	1
I buy this stuff in bulk off of amazon , since they do not sell it Albuquerque , NM . I 've tried a bazillion ( no seriously , I counted ) other chapsticks , and this has been my favorite for a long time . I have a chapstick leash and this kind is always attached to me .	1
it helps a lot , but nothing replaces going to the dentist and getting the cavity filled , only this costs less	1
I keep a tube of Orajel on hand in case I develop a toothache at an inconvenient time ( anytime ! ) . It has a `` numbing '' agent in it that provides instant relief . When it reaches the expiration date , it 's inexpensive enough to discard it and buy a fresh tube .	1
My recent dental appointment was very much like the scene from Little Shop Of Horrors . I 'd gone through life with perfect teeth -- never so much as a cavity came my way . At my last dental appointment the dentist said all was clear , no cavities and no issues -- I made the huge mistake of mentioning & # 34 ; Nothing on the bottom left ? If feels a bit different sometimes when I bite & # 34 ; He said it could be a crack and I should get a crown.He did n't give me enough of the huge needle-the-size-of-my-arm shot prior to filing down that tooth . I could feel it . So he gave me lots more of the big needle.I did n't like it when the assistant said & # 34 ; I am having a hard time getting the temporary crown on . He really did n't leave much of your tooth left. & # 34 ; Yeah , does n't sound good does it considering there really was n't much pain at all and I just wanted him to double check for a cavity.I 'll fast forward through much of the tale but will mention when they did n't numb me upon ripping the temporary crown off my tooth when I came back , I screamed and threw my legs straight up to my chest . Assistant says & # 34 ; Oh , shoot , I guess we did n't get the shot in again & # 34 ; ( They missed my mouth and I could feel the deadening stuff going down my throat ) 4 hours later , still working on it.That was last week.I now live on Orajel and feel like I will the rest of my life.It numbs the swollen area where they did their evil deeds.I have no idea if what they did worked or not because I am in approximately 1,000 times the pain I was prior to my stupid question.But with Orajel I can eat on that side and before I went and bought some , that was impossible .	1
I used this on a mouth sore , as it really hurt and affected my sleep . Slept like a baby with this stuff ! It works !	1
just fine thank youthat all i have tay thank you ilike to have in the house uncase some one needs it	1
This is by far the best product ... ever ... for Urinary Infections . Better than anything you can have prescribed by a Doctor . I did a lot of research about Cystex before I even ordered it.This is a very cleaver product ... each tablet contains 1/2 of a normal aspirin , which acts against the immediate pain , and another ingredient that creates a chemical reaction in the kidneys and bladder and kills the bacteria and cures the problem . I am a very allergic person and afraid to take any medication , but this is a dream come true for me . Do n't expect it to work in minutes , but all of a sudden ... in a few hours ... you will feel pain free . The bottle says dose is 2 Tablets every eight hours , but I only take one every eight hours for two days and it 's just great . This is a staple for every medicine cabinet .	1
( though sometimes I take it along with Prelief -- -also sold at a great price here , on Amazon ! ) Works 99 % of the time when I start taking it soon enough . Highly recommended ! : )	1
I have taken to using Cystex regularly . My mother recommended this to me since she , my sister , and myself tend to get UTIs really frequently . I used to just take them when I could feel a UTI coming on ( burning sensation ) , but I 've started taking them daily as a preventative measure since it 's a lot easier and less painful than getting a full-blown UTI . I generally take one or two a day , unless I feel a UTI coming on and then I will up the dosage.As a comparison , I 've tried the D-Mannose from Now Foods since it had such stellar reviews , but it did not seem to work for me as well as Cystex did . I got a UTI while taking the D-Mannose , so I switched back to Cystex and have been loyal to them ever since.For women who suffer from UTIs like I do , I would recommend Cystex hands down . You can use it if you already have early UTI symptoms , but I really recommend taking it regularly as a preventative treatment .	1
I get UTIs when I get overtired/overtextended , around twice a year . I had been taking AZO but it did not control the pain from the most severe infections ( which always happen Saturday at 4 pm when the Doctor is not available until Monday ! ) . AZO was OK for mild infections.So this time I did some research and people spoke highly of Cystex . Since I did n't have enough time to order it from Amazon I bought it at CVS . It is significantly ( 25-30 % ) cheaper than AZO and works better ( at least for me ) . For the most severe UTIs I would still go to the Doctor and get antibiotics but for moderate and inconveniently timed UTIs , Cystex works beautifully and is a real savior . The pain went away in about 20 minutes and after 2 days of suffering , it was wonderful .	1
Wish I 'd known about this product in my 20s . Now that I 'm in my 40s , I find that the hormonal changes are making UTIs something I need to be vigilant about again , after many years without them . I alternate between taking one of these at bedtime , & a daily tsp of D-mannose as a preventive measure . The mannose absorbs & carries away bacteria & the Cystex has a disinfecting action , so a multi-pronged approach . However , for travel these are a good deal less trouble than mannose which is a white powder . I have not had a single UTI in the 6 months I have been using this . I also give one to my elderly collie twice a week as she has developed the same issue . =o ) At least we 're in this menopausal adventure together .	1
Use the product as directed , and your UTI will be gone in no time . Mine was completely eliminated within three days of using this product and has yet to return . The cap is a bit difficult to open at first but not terribly so . For an over the counter medication , I was extremely surprised at its effectiveness !	1
I was woken up at 3am unexpectedly by my seven year old , who had obviously caught the stomach bug going around . While I sat up with her , I pulled up this stuff and read some reviews . Luckily , there was a 24hour store a mile away , so I ran in and got a couple bottles.With the first dose , it came right back up . The dosage instructions indicate 2 tsp . every 15 minutes until you feel better . To be fair , I gave my daughter one teaspoon . She then stopped vomiting . I gave her another dosage about 45 minutes later ( I could n't get her to take another dose sooner ) but she was right as rain sleeping within a few minutes of the first dose/incident.A few days later , I am up , feeling rough , and hate vomiting . I took the requisite dosage , and started to immediately feel the feeling recede . A second dose , and I too , was ready to sleep . The grown up dose is two tablespoons every 15 minutes.This stuff is made from fructose and phosphoric acid . It coats the tummy and quiets the nerves that are all flipping out and causing the nausea , probably like that old coke syrup the pharmacy used to sell . For that reason , it does n't have the same risks of Reyes Syndrome associated with old Pink.The taste is like a thick cherry syrup , similar to the taste of chewable Tylenol from back in the day . Not great , but not as unbearable as getting sick . My daughter likes the taste , it 's very sweet and cloying , and tastes like an artificial sweetener to an extent.I 'd recommend that you get some and have it on hand for those late night situations . Be aware that it is colored , and may not work with the first dose , so keep a receptacle handy .	1
I 've used Emetrol several times when I 've felt nausea due to various medical conditions , when just the smell of food is enough to push you over the top ! Doctors tend to prescribe antacids , but it 's not indigestion or acid stomach which causes the nausea ... .and Emetrol just takes away that uncomfortable feeling . The taste is pleasant and it does a great job ... .I 'd highly recommend it for simple nausea .	1
There are few things worse than the stomach bug . This winter seemed especially harsh . My entire family ( extended included ) got hit with this . My son , then daughter , then my wife . I knew I was on deck . I will preface this by saying I 'm one of the biggest babies when it comes to throwing up . I hate it with a passion ( does anyone actually LIKE it ? ) . My wife teases me ( makes fun of me ) b/c of the violent , exorcism like sounds of my hurl . Sorry for the visual , just trying to set the stage here . So I know im certainly gon na get sick . I frantically search amazon for anything nausea related . Now this may sound selfish , because I did n't order it til after my family was sick , but to be fair , it all happened so fast . Luckily I had prime service . I knew I had about a 2 day incubation period before the attack would happen . A few days later , my little bottle of joy arrived , As I prepared for my inevitable illness , those next few days I did everything I could to avoid the bug . I carried around Lysol in a holster and whipped it out all around the house . I kept kisses to the wife and kids to forehead only . I drank so much green juice , i almost liked the taste of it ... ..ALMOST . It did n't matter . It was too late . I could do nothing to stop this awful , terrible virus.That night , I took an extra hot shower . I used mouthwash , twice . I knew I was only moments away . I unpacked my bottle of Emitrol and got it ready , like a solider loading his ammo before battle . I got into bed , and told my wife I loved her . I knew what was coming . A night full of chills , shivering , yet burning up . Constant struggle , whining like a child back and forth in bed in between trips to the bathroom . The horrific sounds of my excessively annoying throw up sound . A horrible night sleep for not only me , but my wife , mother of my 2 small children , and for tonight only , a 3rd-the biggest baby of them all ... I 'm not sure what happened next . I remember turning over and looking at the clock . It was 10:43pm EST ( 22:43 in military time ..I think ) . The wave of nausea that hit me was fierce . I knew what i had to do . I went straight to the bathroom and began to vomit . I will spare u the details but it was brutal . It hit me like a ton of bricks . There would be no downtime , no breaks between the pain . I was on the floor shivering , begging God for mercy , promising I would go to church more . I am not strong enough to handle this ! ! ! And I stopped for a moment to think . `` Wait , is that my wife laughing ? '' Anyway , no time for self pity . I had to think and I had to think fast . I looked over and desperate for an answer , there appeared something strange , out of the corner of my eye . The Emitrol . My oasis . I quickly ran over , took a huge swig . I was convinced that it would n't work . That it was just too weak to contain this awful nausea I felt . The worst anyone has probably ever felt ( this is said with obvious embarrassment during my time of need ) . Literally within minutes , I felt a calm come across me . A stillness among the ocean of madness . It had worked . It really worked ! I felt I must go back to bed quickly . While I still feel ok . I fell asleep ... ..I woke up at 6:43 the next day . I had only thrown up once . I did not feel nauseous , just tired and wiped out . Emetrol had saved me . It really saved me . I recommend having a bottle around in the house . It 's safe for children as well . Next time I will not hesitate to give it to anyone in the family . Something that finally works to battle nausea ! ! Now , I ca n't speak for those pregnant mommy morning sickness feelings , but as long as your dr says it 's ok , give it a shot ! It could save you a lot of un-needed agony . ENJOY !	1
When your kids go to school they get exposed to just about everything . About once a year our grandson gets the flu and sick to his stomach . He also has allergies that can make him sick to his stomach when he eats certain foods . Emetrol seems to settle down his nausea and help him not feel so ill.It contains no products that a child should be normally afraid of taking and it is doctor recommended . It does seem to help him a lot . It does recommend that you should not drink any fluids immediately before or after taking the product.We have had good success with it and we keep it on hand for those emergencies !	1
Best stuff I 've found for upset stomach , a life saver ! I always keep it around and recommend it to friends and family .	1
If you 're shopping for this product chances are high that you do n't enjoy vomiting and need a prompt solution to keep your head out of the toilet bowl . I recently encountered exactly this situation due to a rather debilitating and thoroughly unpleasant fast-moving virus making the rounds . Not really being a drinker , I do n't have a lot of experience with regurgitation and was certainly caught off guard by the sudden onset and viciousness of the attack on my digestive tract . Pandemonium reigned : I could n't even keep water down , and the mere thought of food was a terrible idea for reasons I 'd rather not get into here.Anyway ... My doctor told me to stay hydrated ( not as easy as it seemed ) and that it would quickly pass . ( Was that a pun at my expense ? I still do n't know , but did n't have the predisposition to go into the finer points of digestive humor right then . ) I asked a pharmacist what she recommended , and she said the best over the counter medicine for nausea and vomiting was Emetrol . She instructed to take the medicine by drinking the syrup and then not drinking anything else immediately afterwards , repeating per the directions on the box . While Emetrol did n't entirely eliminate my nausea , it did dramatically cut down on the episodes of projectile vomiting I had been dealing with . It does have a very sweet cherry flavor that 's not particularly palatable , but tastes better than bile coming the other way.Ask your doctor or pharmacist before using any medicine , of course , and be advised that this contains fructose , so if you have fructose intolerance obviously do n't use this . Diabetics also know that it 's made from a sugar base , so definitely do n't use it without talking to your doctor first.Emetrol worked well for me . I know this review is lighthearted , but rest assured I am quite serious that the product worked as advertised for me , and if you need quick relief from severe nausea , it 's a good place to start . It may not make you feel great , but for me it took away the worst of the nausea symptoms associated with a nasty gastrointestinal virus .	1
I 've been a pack a day smoker for 40 years now and I just got ta kick this stupid habit . Been using these every day for the past six weeks now and have not yet smoked a cigarette in that time . I think that at this point it might just be psychological , but I 'm still tempted to head over to 7-11 and buy a pack , so I keep putting on a 21 mg patch every morning and continue to tell myself how disgusting it would be if I start smoking again . Still taking it minute by minute and day by day , but I never could be doing this without the aid of the NicoDerm patches .	1
There 's a reason that Nicoderm is top of the line . This patch worked exactly as advertised . It sticks to the skin perfectly and reduces cravings ( does not eliminate them completely ) . It helped me greatly on my journey to quit smoking .	1
My husband has quit smoking using these and I could not be happier . This is a great deal price wise and shipping was expedient and well packaged .	1
Wonderful . Bye bye Cigarettes ! I smoking 15 years . Use 5 patches . Now I m done with cancer steaks and patches ! Super happy !	1
GREAT FOR STOPPING SMKING AID . I HAVE TRIED NICORETTE , AND WALMART 'S BRAND . THIS IS GREAT . NO CRAVINGS FOR A CIGARETTE , NO WITHDRAWAL SYSTEM . IT IS FANTASTIC . I WAS A 2 PACK A DAY SMOKER . THIS WILL MAKE YOU STOP SMOKING . BETTER THAN ANY PATCH OUT THERE . PRICE WAS EQUIVELANT TO WALMART . THAT IS THE ONLY DOWN SIDE . THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LESS . USE IT .	1
I 've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work . I do n't even crave a cigarette while on the plane . However , I realized that maybe it 's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you ca n't have one anyways ( since it 's illegal to smoke on a flight ) . I 'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage . What a mnistake . I should have stuck with it . But now I 'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit , once and for all . I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more . I think I 'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first , and if I find that I 'm still having cravings , then I 'll bump up to the 21 mg .	1
Work very well . Last me throughout the day . Helping me to stay away from smoking , now I just have to kick the patch !	1
I love how easy these blades are to clean . The shaving scum goes through to the other side . Water rinses right through . Cheap disposables have a tendency to get clogged up causing you to cut your self easier .	1
these blades work in my Mach3 great , the only razor that works for me.That 's all I can say.Do n't use anything else .	1
I have been using these Gillette Mach3 cartridge blades really work well for over 20 years and they still work perfectly .	1
great price for that much I always use this brand work for me great I will keep using if stays same price .	1
I like these . I use them for my arm pits and legs . They have enough rows and I have not had any problems with them .	1
I have sensitive skin and tough bristle . I have tried cartridges with different number of blades from 1 to 5 . The optimal number of blades is three . Smaller number does not shave at one pass . Larger number does not improve shaving whereas increases skin irritation and worsen cartridge contact with skin .	1
I have been using these blades for several years . Amazon offers them at a price much lower than I have found anywhere . I 'll use these as long as they 're available . I get a great shave , and do n't have to spend a lot more money on a newer model . These are terrific .	1
It is always nice to have a supply of razors on hand . Both my wife and I use these razors , so we always need a lot on hand .	1
I get free shipping on Subscribe and save and a lower price . This is a good buy and Amazon shippng is quick and reliable . My husband has used these razors for many years and will use no other .	1
I guess you can call me a stick in the mud . However since I started using these blades I have no incentive to change . So far , I found the three-blade system the optimal . Two blades work but they feel cheap . More than three blades feel like I am just overdoing it . I actually use the advanced indicator-lubricating strip to indicate when it is time to change blades because I really can not tell . If it was not for the indicator strip , I probably use the same blade for a year . The package is a convenient size to ensure that you will not run out blades every time you turn around.I use bar soap as my lubricant however ; I do not really need one so it is more of a placeholder . One quick rinse and everything is clean and ready to start over with the next day.The Razor 's Edge by Somerset Maugham	1
Mach 3 's are the way to go ! I had a concern with my order and the vendor cleared it up immediately . These are the real thing and it 's a great price . It 's a vendor you can trust .	1
Progreat blade , super shave , excellent price when purchased on this size packageit is on automatic delivery so the price drops some what.Contoo much plastic to get rid of ... .. environmentally poor	1
This is just what you think it is . So if you like the Mach3 blades , pick them by price . I have seen lower prices at box stores but around here they are far away .	1
these are GREAT for shaving things ... work perfectly on your face , legs , and even crotchal region . not so good on cats though .	1
I bought these for my 86 year old Dad , he already has everything he needs , and with blades being so expensive , I thought he would enjoy this every day . I use that brand too . They are really good . Wish blades were n't so expensive . I 'm able to use one blade for several weeks with these ... ..just for my legs .	1
I use them too - as a woman . I feel that this products exceeds any of the other products on the market specially made for women . So , personally , I will keep using this .	1
My boyfriend prefers this razor model over the newer ones that have four blades . He says this is definitely the one to use and I was happy to find a deal on the replacement cartridges . His face is always smooth and kissable and I 've never seen him nick himself which has happened with other razors . Overall a great price for the replacement cartridges .	1
This product is the only one my husband will use , and I 'm so glad he does ! His face is always so smooth and soft . These never cause him any irritation at all and the shave is super close ! HIghly recommend ! ( Lol -- -not to mention that I occasionally steal it for myself -- shhh , do n't tell ! )	1
I 've been dragging these blades across my face since they came out , I 'm guessing it 's been about 14 years now . I 've even got dad using them ... neither of us handle electric shavers too well , so this is it for us .	1
This item is exactly the same as it would be in my local drug store or supermarket , at a far better price .	1
These work as expected . I find Mach3 to be one of the best Gileltte razors . Probably not as good as the Fusion but much cheaper , so think it is worth the price .	1
I 've been using the Mach3 's for as long as I can remember . I ca n't stand shaving and only do it every 3 to 4 days . These do the job and seems to last a long time before need to be replace . I 'd probably go a whole year with one 12 pack but my wife is always stealing them for herself . Ca n't stand electric shavers .	1
I began scanning things that I buy often with the amazon app for iPhone . This is one of the many products I continue to save money on . No difference from the ones I have bought at the local stores other than price .	1
I started using Gillette Mach3 blades many years ago . I was an old Gillette Sensor user and could n't believe the difference after switching . The best part about these blades is how the backs are completely open . That style allows the cut hairs to easily get pushed or wash out of the back without clogging the blades . Using the old style Sensor blades , all the cut hair gets stuck in the blades until you wash it out . With this style , you can keep shaving and the hair just keeps getting pushed out of the back . Much faster with this style blade . Overall , love the performance of the blades . I do n't have any plans of switching anytime soon.As for the pricing , the last time I purchased these from Amazon , it was a much better deal . My last set of 15 blades cost just under $ 20 . The Subscribe & Save Program used to be much better than it is now . The discount back then was something like 15 % . Now with the small discount of 5 % , it really is n't much cheaper than your local store , especially since you can get coupons for these once in a while . Make sure to shop around .	1
I have been using the Mach3 for about 7 years now and I have not interest in using anything else . Very smooth , no nicks or cuts and last for 3-4 weeks per blade with daily use . The 15 pack was the best price I found anywhere per blade .	1
I love this price , free shipping , and not having to remember to pick these up at the store . They just automatically ship them when I need them . These also work on the women 's Venus Vibrance razor . I did n't like the razors that came with mine , they had shaving cream already in them but I really liked the razor . This is a good fix for that situation .	1
We use to buy these at Sam 's Club until we found them at Amazon . Great price . I have these things cost so much but what else are you going to do ?	1
I tried the Fusion product and have now gone back to Mach3 . I contacted P & G ; over my concerns and must say that you are totally on your own if you have a problem . P & G ; wo n't even take the time to respond to a person letter or issues related to their products.The Mach3 is a good , simple and straight-forward product that works well . The price on all blades is so very , very high when you think about the basic components , but one needs them . So , this is my preference .	1
For years and years I used some variation of the Gillette Trac 2 . These blades gave me a decent shave , and I had no real reason to complain.I do n't remember when I first started using Gillette Mach 3 , but I could definitely tell the difference from the first shave . My first impression was that this blade is amazing ! I remember how the first time I dragged it across my face I could barely feel it . It was much smoother than any other razor I 'd ever used before . Not only was it a smooth shave , but it cleanly took off all my whiskers and did so more perfectly than the Trac 2.I 've noticed , however , that it does n't take that long before the shave is n't quite as smooth and close as it was at first . And then the blades seem to go into a mode where they give a decent shave for a long time . And then , at some point , I realize it 's just not doing the job anymore , and I put in a new blade.I 've never had any problems with the handle , and I 've been using the first one I got for years now with no complaints . I solve the price problem of the replacement blades by buying them in bulk on either Ebay or Amazon.There may be better razors or blades out there , but I 'm content enough with the Mach 3 that I 've stocked up on enough to last me for years ! If these are inferior knockoffs , I guess I just have n't noticed .	1
I get about 3 weeks to a month 's use out of every one of these , which means for a 15 count box I get about a year 's worth of shaving . These things are great and give me the closest shave with the least cuts out of any other razor .	1
got these due to great price with subscribe and save . will keep getting them as long as the price remains decent.the blades are good . last longer than some brands . fits both my razor and my husband 's razor so it is a great value to us .	1
Gillette Mach3 Cartridges are what you expect , i just like the price and not needing to go to the store for them	1
I purchased there refill blades for my husband last year ... ... he really likes them ... ..they last a long time , give a close shave and were reasonable ... ..I will purchase again in the future .	1
I recommend these . They 're super nice , and my boyfriend tossed these my way when he ordered the wrong ones and now I 've tossed my lady razors away ! highly recommend for a clean , sleek and sexy finish !	1
These blades are great . I have been using them for years . I do get quite a bit of reuse out of them before i have to switch The blades . they Have worked very well for me so far . I will continue to use this product for quite some time .	1
Good economical package . No issues . Saves a lot over regular retail prices . Same blades as in stores , but cheaper . Good deal .	1
I ca n't imagine at his point there is anything left to say about Mach 3 blades . But for me they clog way less than Fusion ones and last a long time .	1
Three blades are enough for us at this price . My husband and I have used these for years with no regrets . Quite frankly , I ca n't imagine using any other razor but refuse to pay for turbo blades - think it 's overkill unless your hacking away through a jungle .	1
I ordered the Mach3 from Amazon when it was running its specials . I saved about $ 3-4 per 12-pack compared to the local stores . These blades are expensive as they are . It helps to get a special deal once in a while from Amazon . I wish they would include in their `` subscribe and save ''	1
This is a product that my son uses and has found to be the best product among similar brands and is very happy with	1
My husband has a thick , dark beard and dainty , sensitive pale skin . These blades work well and do n't irritate his skin . No five o'clock shadow ; no razor burn . Using blades instead of disposables saves plastic and you get to hold a nice metal handle.Perfect , huh ? Well , a straight razor is more green -- it 's forever if you just sharpen it , but he 's not going there .	1
I reviewed this product online before I bought it . I learned to make sure it had a blister sustainable pack . I went ahead a purchased this product on Amazon because it beat other prices on different sites . I will buy again . Great price ! ! It feels awesome against your skin .	1
I buy these for my husband every christmas and have found the best prices right here . He likes the way they shave and does not want to switch .	1
I 've tried them all . This is by far the best blade for me . 4 blades are way too large and make it difficult to get between the stache and the nose . Price is still steep .	1
This is the only razor my guy uses . I would partially guess because he does n't like change , but I know that he wo n't use anything substandard so I am confident in passing on that this is a good razor . Consistent in quality and effect , and hey it 's a product still made in the U.S.A. How can you beat that !	1
This feels like the ones I get from the store . It took a long time to order these because of the bad reviews , but once good ones started coming in I decided to take a chance . Well , it paid off cause so far no problems with them.Update : 26 Mar 13 , still using blades from this order . I shave about two or three time a week so it 's about a month before I change blades . Still satisfied with order .	1
wish some of the other sellers would ship to hawaii because then i could get these alot cheaper . but with that said these are still a great price and the cheapest ive seen around here	1
Ca n't beat Amazon for the price , real genuine products delivered fast . The price I paid for the quantity of Mach 3 blades is better than wholesale club prices too ! !	1
Mach 3 makes a great blade , especially for sensitive skin as both my husband and sons have . The blades last long as long as kept well . I think the price is great considering Walgreens charges the same price for less blades	1
I 've been using Mach3 for seven years and they are the best razors on the market in my opinion . I 've used electric razors , the 4-bladed Schick Quattro , as well as the really cheap 1-bladed throwaway kind . None work better than these . At the price of about a dollar a blade , they are very so worth it .	1
been using mach 3 blades for years , and they work great . I 've ( unknowingly ) bought knockoffs on ebay before , and was able to tell the difference immediately and got a refund . Since then I 've been buying them on amazon , because they 're cheapest here as long as you buy a decent quantity.I 've tried 4-blade and 5-blade razors , and none are any better , so I have n't bothered to permanently switch.also , you can make your blades last longer by storing the blades in mineral/baby oil when not in use . It prevents the oxidation and dulling of the blades	1
Works good as expected from Gillette Cartridges . Comes good packed and seems original . Good price . Usually my husband shaves every day ex . weekend and a cartridge lasts about 3 or more weeks .	1
A male friend told me about these blades when they first came out on the market years ago . I 've never purchased them on amazon , only at a grocery store or drug store . I will never use another type of blade because of the smoothness of the shave . I use them for my legs and underarms . I also use a very good moisturizing shaving gel with it .	1
These are the best blades ever ! ! They are a bit expensive , but well worth it . They give the closest shave ever .	1
Razor blades are extremely expensive . The cheapest place to buy this brand of razor blades is Amazon , by selecting the & # 34 ; Subscribe and Save & # 34 ; option . They end up being the cheapest cost per blade when compared to Sams , Costco , HEB , Kroger , etc.I have been using the Mach 3 line for 8 years solid . The only issue I have with the blades is the top and bottom Aloe Vera lining which quickly falls off . This can end up scraping your face when shaving , which is quite annoying . Typically by the time this happens it is time to change the blade anyways . However , I have recently heard you can sharpen the blades by dragging them across a pair of jeans , which I have yet to try - the stripping of the protective aloe vera layer might be an issue if this method of sharpening does in fact work.The main reason for giving this product 5 stars is because Amazon is the cheapest place to buy them , and they work well . I have tried other products such as the Fusion 5 blades , the girl Gillette razors , and others yet still found the Mach 3 razors to be the best .	1
This is about the third time That I have ordered this product & reviewed it needless to say I am very happy with it .	1
I 'm an older guy with a very tough beard . When I was just beginning to shave ( about 48 years ago ) my father proudly gave me a Remington electric razor . It never did a good enough job and I found myself going for a Gillette blade system.I have used these Gillette Mach 3 's ever since they came out . They do the job for me better than anything else I 've tried , so I 've stuck with them . I buy them on Amazon when the price is right.For those reviewers claiming that they received fake blades , send them back for a refund . Or better yet , contact Gillette and let them know what you received . Gillette wants to stop the trade in counterfeit blades and will be happy to work with you .	1
These blades work very well on my thick beard . There is n't any reason for me to pay more for any other blade .	1
I had never thought about reviewing razor blades , but here goes . I have been using these for at least 15 years . I have tried other razors , but I always go back to these . As long as they continue to make them , this will be my blade of choice . They are expensive , but each blade lasts well over a month , even on my thick facial hair ! !	1
I always try to buy these in bulk so I do n't have to worry if my husband will run out . I watch for the sales and try to get the 10 pack to save a bit of money .	1
This is a good price for the razor blades , compared to other stores I have shopped for them . Good size to price . Highly Recommend !	1
I take these when I travel by plane since I ca n't take my usual double edge razor blades in a carry-on . These work well and the cartridges seem to last for many shaves .	1
I use these , not my husband . They last long and do n't nick . It 's a smooth good glide . I need three more words , oh ... got them .	1
Wondered about if these were as good as the ones I bought at wal mart or some other store and reading some of the reviews made me suspicious but I have been using these for a while and no problem at all . If they are & # 34 ; fake & # 34 ; or such the are damned good fakes . Love em and will continue to use them .	1
These blades are great for covering substantial shaving surface quickly . It is a little broad for close trimming work . I use them to shave my head .	1
Men pick their favorite razor and blade and stick with it - at least that is my experience . The price is better on Amazon than the corner grocery or drug store so I buy them here . My husband has a thick and course beard and he demands this blade . Once in awhile I sneak a leg shave with his razor and I get a nice close shave for myself too . Shhh , do n't tell him . : - )	1
It is easy to load and gives a great close shave . I can even dry shave with it in the afternoon if I start to get a 5 o'clock shadow . That is hard to do with just any razor .	1
I have used many razor blades over the years , but have experienced no closer or more comfortable shaves than those provided by the Gillette MACH3 Cartridges . I can not perceive a difference between these blades and four-bladed designs . They seem to last an extraordinary length of time between replacement , which helps justify the cost . Amazon Prime value and rapid delivery spoil me as usual .	1
Several other reviewers felt that they had been shipped second quality blades . My husband says these blades are just fine and there is no difference from the ones he had been paying considerably more for in the stores .	1
Paid $ 10 on a Gold Box sale . Definitely a good price for these lades . I usually pay $ 6-8 for a pack of 4 at the grocery store/pharmacy.These are decent blades , and I like them much more than Schick blades . They clean easily , are sharp , and last a long while . In my option , the best all-around blades on the market .	1
IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONI fell in love with Mach3 razors years and switched over from a single-blade ( not straight-edge ) razor . I just wish the price was cheaper ! I saved a few bucks and time by ordering these Mach3 razors directly through Amazon . Everything went fine with the order . The package arrived quickly and the product was not opened . The razors appear to be in their original packaging ( plastic is not cut and it is the Gillete stuff ) .THE CATCHI thought I had gotten past all the online negative reviews of counterfeits . Nonetheless , I found it quite odd that the plastic cases ( holding 4 razors each ) were scrapped and had smudges on them once I cut open the plastic packaging . Those oddities seem to suggest the product is not brand new.CONCLUSIONAll seems fine so far . We 'll see ...	1
I 've been using the Gillette Mach 3 for years , and even though I 've tried others from time to time , I keep coming back to their three-blade system . These cartridges have been a great replacement , but I think there 's something important you should consider when buying them . There are negative reviews here where customers say they got fake or knock-off replacements . I added this to cart by picking a Prime eligible product that says & # 34 ; Shipped from and sold by Amazon & # 34 ; , and the package that arrived is the real deal.If you 're new to the Mach 3 , it 's a great razor for a lot of things . I have a friend who swears by it for shaving his head , but says you have to be slow and careful . For me , it does a great job on my face and neck . The three hyper-sharp blades in the Mach 3 's head really do a nice job of paring down the daily stubble without cutting me up or roughing up my face . That said , there are some basics to shaving that also make a difference , regardless of what you use : - drag slowly- drag in the direction the hair grows ( and learn the parts of your face where it changes direction ) - do n't press down- do repeat strokes for problem areas- expect to feel some stubble no matter what -- the goal is to minimize it , but it 'll never go away unless you pluck the hairs out ( ouch ! ) - when you towel off , pat your skin , do n't scrub- if you 're going to put something on your skin afterwards , avoid anything with alcohol in it : alcohol burns your skin while lotions moisturizeI use these in a standard Mach 3 handle and in one that vibrates using a AAA battery . The latter is a bit easier to use , but not necessary : either will work for you just fine . There is a more expensive version of these blades for sensitive skin that is supposed to have better lubricating strips , but I do n't find that to be worth the extra money ... if anything the strips on the 'Sensitive ' just wear out quicker than these do.If you 're new to the Mach 3 , it 's a great razor . But unless shaving gives you real skin problems , you probably do n't need the extra 'Sensitive ' strip ... these cartridges do a great job .	1
Works well for me to dry shave every morning although I have gone 3 days and if careful you can still get a great shave	1
I 've used Mach 3 since 2000 . It is the best razor , and I 've yet to find one to compare . I only wish it was n't so expensive . Should n't technology make products cheaper over time ? Mach 3 has become more expensive . Still it 's a good razor with an equally high premium .	1
I graduated from the Gillette Sensor XL to the Mach 3 many years ago . I have since tried a few new models thinking that perhaps one of these new razors might work better ... but I keep coming back to this razor.The Mach 3 is so far , the only replaceable blade razor that I have found I can easily , properly shave my head without nicks and cuts . The blades tend to wear fairly quickly compared with the Shick Hydro 5 , but what is the use of longer lasting blades that slice my head to ribbons ? The grip is a great improvement on the Sensor XL , more heft , better wet grip . The blades are easy to attach and remove . They last me a couple of weeks on average , but I shave my head every two to three days and shave my neck below my beard every day . That 's a lot of use.I did start using a new shave gel and it works magically with the razor . No more issues with serious gumming up of the blades . Check outKing of Shaves AlphaGel Shave Gel Sensitive - 5 oz.. It 's expensive for a shave gel , but nothing works better for shaving my head and preventing the shave gel/cream from gumming the blades.I know the replacement blades are expensive , and many third party sellers are reselling stolen merchandise ... but that 's part of why they are expensive . Those of us who are buying the blades on the up and up are paying for all those stolen and re-sold packages . So I just recommend buying from a store or trusted seller rather than eBay . Also watch for replacement blades not sold in retail packaging . Often these are either knock offs or have 'fallen off a truck ' . Spend the extra $ 5 and make sure you are getting the quality blades from a reliable source .	1
I 've tried many razors over the years including various electrics , and when I do n't have a beard I always come back to the Mach3 . The Mach3 was introduced by Gillette in 1998 , and while I do n't remember exactly when I bought a Mach3 set ( or `` system , '' i.e. , a handle and two blades ) , it was probably in 1998 or 1999 . Since then I 've gone through a number of blades but have never replaced the handle , because I have n't had to.I have a pretty tough beard and have to shave daily if I want ( or feel obliged ) to look clean shaven.According to the current Wikipedia entry for the Mach3 , the blades cost 9 cents to produce . I 've read conflicting stories about the history of disposable razor blades and I 'm not sure what to believe . But it seems to me that disposable razor blades and cartridge type blades in particular , like printer inks , are high profit margin items that deserve to be characterized as ripoffs . I recently tried using old fashioned double edge razors , the kind I stated with when I started shaving in the last sixties - I not only have my own old double-edge blade holder but have two even older ones that I inherited from my late dad - but as has always been my experience , I could not get through a shave without an annoying cut or two ( and then I end up going out with little pieces of bloody tissue stuck to my face ) . If I thought I could get a clean , bloodless shave with a straight razor I 'd go that route . Electric razors can be okay in a pinch but it takes too much time and effort for me to get a really clean shave with an electric , and even then it 's never as clean as the shave I can get with a Mach3 . ( I discovered Aveeno shave gel a few years ago and though I do n't have sensitive skin , I 've found that it works better for me than any other gel or cream I 've used . ) Obviously , not all guys have as good an experience with the Mach3 as I 've had , and that makes sense , because every guy 's beard and skin is different.When I have more than a couple of day 's growth , I find it easier to go over my beard with an electric before applying gel and using a Mach3 ; otherwise the Mach3 has to do too much work .	1
There is n't too much to say about it but it seems to be a good razor and the price is right . I like it . I would recommend .	1
I have used disposal razors ( great when you have the facial hair of a teenager ) , electric razors ( pretty good for a while , but the replacement blades are expensive ) , and several generations of Gillette razors . The Mach3 is the best yet , though I have yet to try the new Fusion razor.Gillette makes all sorts of claims regarding the Mach3 . I am unable to tell whether any of the claims have merit . I can tell you that the blades , though expensive , last a long time for me . I have moderately tough facial hair . The old disposable razors gave me a few days of shaving and they were history . I have shaved up to two months with these razors and still got a good shave.I have read that there are controversies about the value of three blades . I think the three blades help keep the razor at the optimum angle on my face for shaving . I do get a pretty good shave as well . I do use Edge Advanced Shave Gel in combination with my Gillette Mach3 , which may help get me a better shave.Most men in the United States shave , whether we like it or not . The Gillette Mach3 gives me the best and most consistent shave I have ever had . Until I find a better razor , the Mach3 is the one for me.Enjoy !	1
I bought this off Amazon after my M3 Power Razor broke the first time I dropped it in the shower ! That was the second M3 Power that broke in the same place , so I reverted back to the Classic.This give you a great shave , and the cartridges are considerably less than the current generation of razors ...	1
Bought this as a replacement for my 10 year old razor . The old one had two blades in the cartridge . This one shaves a lot smoother .	1
I 'm 25 years old and this is my first time ever using a razor . This razor is fantastic . I used it along with some Gilette shaving cream . The cream keeps my face moisturized and the razor goes over it very easily . The few bumps I had even went down . Gives you a very close shave . Does n't take a lot of pressure to shave either . The hair comes off almost effortlessly .	1
This is a nice razor and the blades that come with it are cheaper than the fusion and other modern blades . Provides a clean shave .	1
Will buy when these get dull . About one full year after I buy them . Long lasting and a great product .	1
Love this razor . I have been using quality disposals for years but after using this one , will not go back to a disposal . Lasts a long time and keeps sharp	1
Shaving is about as personal thing you can do . It 's not an experience you can share . It does n't make for scintillating conversation . So , PERSONALLY , the Gillette Mach 3 is the best razor for my beard . My beard is pretty tough : to use the belabored joke , my five o'clock shadow makes its appearance around noon . And it 's thick . However , the skin underneath is very sensitive . This razor gives me that `` close shave '' without irritating my face . The price for the cartidges are , yes , a little high . But it 's a small price to pay for a product that works . It 's sort of like paying a little extra for `` bathroom tissues '' . ( But that 's another personal thing we do alone that rarely makes for scintillating conversation . )	1
I got my first Mach3 when I registered for Selective Service . That was 10 years ago , and I 'm still using them today . Although I 've tried the Mach3 Turbo , the M3 Power , and the Mach3 disposables , I always end up going back to the original . It 's as good today as it was then and I 'm so glad the U.S. Government sent me one as thanks for signing up for the draft .	1
No Complaints about this shaving gel . It defintely lasts a long time and serves a purpose . It is simple and effective .	1
It is what it is- no major comments . The only thing I could mention is that it 's very watery & runny the first couple times I use it ... probably the first 1/4 at least , before it gets foamy . Whatever .	1
for the price you cant beat it and the quantity is great i wont have to buy this stuff for a while but when i do i know where to look thanks	1
I like it , but I like the gel more . This works great , but I just like the gel formula better . Gillette still though .	1
Have n't used yet , but have used same product before . Works very well and smell is very pleasant	1
Not only does my doctor like Vicks , but I put this in my vaporizer and it really gets rid of the sinus drainage . I had put up my vaporizer for the season but I ended up getting it back out because it really is what was helping with sinus issues .	1
Great it does what i buy it for i also love the strong vicks sent it give off just the way i like it when my nose is all stuffed up	1
love the smell , very calming . however the day after smells very disgusting and moldy . does help with congestion and a good nights rest .	1
I 've not used a cough suppressant with my humidifier before , but thought it worth a try . Honestly , at first I thought the price might be a little high , imagining I 'd be pouring the liquid into the water , but only a few drops are needed per use . This is going to last me quite a while . Great value . Oh , and the vapor is so helpful when I 'm sick .	1
This really helps me breath easier when I am congested , but my girl friend cant stand it she says it is too strong	1
I 've never understood why Amlactin ( and same-formula creams/lotions ) have never been very popular for dry skin . People always go for the cosmetic brand lotions , but Amlactin works differently and MUCH better . The active ingredient in Amlactin is lactic acid , which exfoliates dry , itchy or bumpy skin , and is great for those with keratosis pilaris . After just a few applications , you 'll notice soft , supple , silky smooth skin.It smells a touch & # 34 ; chemical-ish & # 34 ; but it 's not strong and the scent does n't last , like some scented lotions . Also , since it 's not fragranced , guys can use it too ( actually my dad does ) .It tends to run a bit on the pricy side for lotions , but it 's definitely worth it , especially if you have rough , dry , bumpy skin .	1
I 've tried tons of acne treatments , and I stumbled upon this . I use it at night , and I 've had the best improvement in my skin yet ! I 'm super excited about it . Works great on my hands , too ! yeah it 's mildly smelly , but I can handle it !	1
I 've tried many different lotions & creams to end up with dry , irritated ( sensitive ) skin . Nothing seemed to work . At first the price of this made me now want to try it , because if it did n't work I was out that money & left with a bottle to pawn off on family.After just one use ( after showering ) I put this on & my skin did n't feel tight , dry , itchy or irritated . My hands are always cracking & itchy because of washing so much during the day & now I can go a couple washes without adding more lotion.My skin is really soft , not oily or greasy & I will continue to use this lotion for how ever long I can afford the luxury of buying it . I 'd recommend to anyone with sensitive , dry or problem skin .	1
I have extremely dry and rough feeling feet and ankles this product is great/ I smooth it on right after my shower . I have no problem with dry skin all day . It will take some time to make them as soft as I 'd like but this lotion is really good . But I must say this product works all over my body . But it will definitely work in those trouble areas , Must use it when the skin is moist after shower for best results .	1
I love this product , it 's used every day . We love AmLactin so much we buy it on subscription so we wo n't run out of it . This was also recommended by my skin doctor . Thanks	1
I 've got keratosis pilaris , aka chicken skin . This does a great job of smoothening out the skin on my arms . It takes awhile to start working , as in weeks to months , but you 'll definitely feel a difference . I feel less self conscious about my arms when in public wearing a short sleeved shirt.The only thing i did n't like about it was how runny it is . It 's very watery , so you should rub it between your hands then distribute it to the body part otherwise it 'll just drip everywhere . Also once it 's on your skin it feels kind of sticky for awhile , till it absorbs more.Overall i 'd recommends this product because it does it 's job pretty well . Price is a little higher than i 'd like but my arms are smoother so i 'm happy to pay that price .	1
I do n't know why people are griping about the smell . This is a great product , comparable to far more expensive , high fallutin brands sold at expensive stores . I will buy it again . It smells a tad odd at first , but the smell immediately goes away and my skin is soft , supple and it even halted post sunburn peeling .	1
Makes my skin VERY soft . However , I have not used it much because , living on the east coast in PA , the humidity is rising with the approach of summer , and I have natural relief from dry skin . I will be using it again as winter and dry air approaches . It does a great job ! Better than any other lotion I have tried .	1
AmLactin moisturizing products come in different strengths to help alleviate rough , dry skin . This `` Moisturizing Body Lotion '' is for everyday use ( recommended use is 2X daily ) and works well to keep skin hydrated.For a dry skin cure , begin with AmLactin 's `` XL Lotion '' for feet and hands or `` Ultra Hydrating Body Cream '' for all over smoothing . Once your desired results are achieved , switch to this one for maintenance.Currently Amazon directly sells only the Moisturizing Body Lotion . It is also the only Amlactin product available through Subscribe and Save . Other AmLactin products are available from third parties , some of whom are Prime eligible.You 'll be hard pressed to find the Moisturizing Lotion anywhere for less than Amazon and I cross my fingers that Amazon will again directly sell the other AmLactin products .	1
I purchased this lotion with much doubt . I have had the ugly skin on the back of my arms my entire life and I have tried many different things . Not only has this lotion worked to dramatically minimize the red bumps , but it leaves my skin super soft too . I have been using it about a month , although not daily . I am a fan and I will continue ordering it .	1
Amlactin lotions always soothe and heal my skin . I have dry skin and this lotion never fails to soothe and replenish .	1
I use AmLactin Moisturizing Body Lotion in the winter and it keeps all the dead skin cells away so my skin is nice and smooth , not all flakey . I have used this product for years now and would recommend it to anyone with dry winter skin .	1
AmLactin does help moisterize and smooth out bumpy skin . This product is so expensive so a little dab in those problem places will helps . More savings when you use Amazon 's Subscribe and Save program . Just wished the product was not so expensive .	1
I have very dry skin and this was recommended by my dermatologist . It is a bit pricy , but worth it as it keeps my skin well moisturized . I have not had dry flaky skin since I began using AmLactin . Other moisturizers did not work for me.Amazon sells AmLactin Moisturizing Body Lotion at a greatly reduced price than I have paid locally at the pharmacy . Who knew ? It is now on my subscribe and save list and I do save $ 5.00 per bottle every three months .	1
I have extremely dry skin and was constantly itching and scratching , sometimes actually causing bleeding . I tried AmLactan Mosturizing Body Lotion and FINALLY got some relief from the constant scratching . It took about four days to completely stop all the scratching . I used the product just once a day , even though the directions say to apply twice daily . Now my skin is soft and silky feeling and the scabs from bleeding have disappeared . The ammonia like smell of older bottles that I have used is no longer present . They seem to have improved the formulation . It 's now completely odor free . I just found the 20 ounce size on sale at Costco.com for $ 15.49 including shipping . I will never stop using this product . It works just as advertized . I would highly recommend this product to anyone with dry skin and itching . Visit the manufacturers website at amlactin.com for more information and you can even sign up for their newsletter . I 'm a fan FOREVER !	1
The only negative I 've encountered with this lotion is the temporary , rather strong ammonia odor it has , the ingredient that provides it 's effectiveness in growing new , healthy skin . A minor tradeoff when you consider the potential benefits . It gives me fantastic moisturizing all day long .	1
I have truly enjoyed lathering myself with this cream and watching the dryness get better as was ordered by my MD	1
I used my facial scrubber ( Clarisonic dupe ) , then applied this lotion to the back of my arms once they dried . After two sessions , I barely have KP bumps anymore ( granted it is summer , when I have less KP bumps ) . I also apply this to my elbow , and they 're soft . I put it in a different area than & # 34 ; regular & # 34 ; lotion , since it 's pricier and I do n't want DH mistakenly using it up on his hands .	1
I developed a terrible dry skin problem . Very bad flaky skin shedding everywhere . My dermatologist recommended this and it ABSOLUTELY works . It is a little expensive but it works ! ! ! The price varies from Amazon , Walmart , and CostCo . I will have to use this the rest of my life but at least I wo n't have embarrassing flaky skin .	1
My dermatologist recommended I use this lotion for extremely dry skin . ( I do n't have any other skin conditions , so please keep that in mind if you are considering using this product for a specific issue other than dry skin . ) I 've been using it twice a day for about 5 days and am totally impressed with the results . My skin was VERY dry and VERY itchy , and this lotion has completely eliminated those symptoms . My skin feels great , and I 'm not constantly itching and fidgeting ! My only complaint is that the lotion is tacky when applied . This little feature is annoying , but not bad enough to make my stop using the lotion . I highly recommend this lotion for super dry skin .	1
These jugs are Perfect for a Subscription ! ! We ordered them because we always get them at the grocery store ( Costco ) anyway . How awesome that they were on subscription AND we saved around $ 2.00 per jug !	1
I am very happy with this product after having major surgery , a tracheal resection , initially left with a huge scar . It 's been at least two weeks I have been using the product and the scar has improved so much . I would use this on any scars that were noticeable or bothersome as I feel this has done so much for me already . My recovery time is supposed to be close to a year , and I am not ashamed of the scar now .	1
My wife took a bad spill several weeks ago leaving a really bad gash along her arm . She 's been applying this since then . So far , there 's been no sign of a keloid or rippling of the skin at the site of the wounds . There is , however , a distinct discoloration at the site .	1
This product absolutely works ! I do n't really have a huge problem with blemishes , but over the years I 've had a few that left marks on my chin , some old , some new . Within a week of using this , I 'm already noticing a difference in the scars , the color has lightened , and they 're getting smaller . Definitely recommend it .	1
Hi , If you have acne scars like me then I suggest this product . I have tried a lot of different things , but nothing has seemed to work as well as this . I think its because acne scars are the same thing as scars anywhere else on the body . So , if you have been like me searching for something to lighten your scaring then look no further and buy this !	1
Is definitely fading scars . Works slowly -- you have to put on at least 3/day and use for months , but it does work !	1
My Physical Therapist recommended this to me to help with tissue mobility above the area where I had a plate and screws put into my fibula where I had surgery for a broken bone . It seems to have a positive effect however the scar is still quite visible . It may have helped reduce the visibility of the scar but the effect is not as significant as it would seem from the pictures provided on the box . That said it did accomplish what my PT wanted but I do n't give 5 stars because I do n't see it as a & # 34 ; must have & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; must buy & # 34 ; which I consider a 5 star rating to be .	1
My c-section scar was 8 months old when I started using this . 4 weeks later , it is already 50 % faded ! Awesome product !	1
great product for a great priceyou can see you results in 6 weeksno greasy feeling on your skin	1
The product does take some time to start working however it 's faded a recent scar and shrunk it very well !	1
I had a HUGE newly healed scrape that took up half my forearm and it was starting to scar up in a weird bumpy way . I was n't sure if this was really going to work because reviews seemed mixed , but it sounded like the newer the scar is , the better it works . Honestly , I 've been using it for a few weeks ( I try for once a day , but I occasionally forget ) and the results are AMAZING . It literally looks better every day . The weird bump & # 34 ; over scarring & # 34 ; areas were gone after TWO days . Now my scar had JUST healed . I started applying it a few days after the last of the scabbing had gone , so I suspect that 's why I 've had such great luck .	1
good moisturizer , but I feel like I should see more fading of the scar by now ... will continue to use as directed , hoping for continued fading	1
The product says it could take 3 months to work . I am only using it about a month so I do n't know yet the full results . I do see some small improvement so I am hoping to see much better results in a couple of months .	1
I had a C-Section and had n't exactly started using this product right away . Half my scar is faded and the other side is not . I assume the doctor cut pretty deep , after all , baby got ta come out after all !	1
Old injury continue to be aggravated and reopens wound since it is so close to the surface . It will even bleed but I notice he is using Mederma pretty faithfully now and the old scar seems to be healing . I am making a judgement that it is going to be a very good product because of the results I already see . .You do have to be faithful and consistent in the use though .	1
it works . The Product is pretty good . I would buy again . Good value for the price . I would recommend.buy it	1
My daughter got a scar on her face . She picked off a scab on her face and the resulting scar was bright red . I gave it some time , but the redness did not fade readily . I understand scars can fade over time , especially on kids ; but since it was on her face , I did not want to take any chances . That it only might work was good enough for me . I 've used Mederma regularly on her face for about a month and it is definitely faded , not so noticeable anymore.I also have a deep scar that is 35 years old right smack on the bridge of my nose . It 's not fading any more than it has . I decided to try it on that and also a recent burn scar on my arm . The scar on my arm is looking better . It 's still there but smooth and fading . The one on the bridge of my nose is deep . I think it looks better but it will be many months before I think I 'll truly know . I 'll be back to update at that time.For now , I think it does seem to help and really does n't hurt new scar formation .	1
I noticed stretch marks on abdomen got lighter and less noticeable . It does n't take them away . It is very true that stretch marks are permanent because your middle layer of skin has actually torn . This product can be pricey but it is worth the money especially if you do n't have many stretch marks . But if you have a lot of large ones You can try a TCA chemical peel . I have noticed that they strengthen the skin by improving collagen and elastin production which in proper amts keeps the skin from tearing .	1
Thanks to an accident at the river I ended up with a large scar at my wrist . I have scars over most of my body so it didnt bother me . What did bother me is going to hand cashiers money and them looking down at my wrist and looking back up at me with that `` oh my he tried to '' looks . The mederma has smoothed the surface and reduced the red shade by 2/3 after 4 weeks . I 'm going to continue using the product for another 4 weeks and see how much better it gets .	1
I have been using this for about two weeks and I can see a difference on a newer scar . I havent noticed any differences with older scars , but it 's supposed to take longer . I use it everyday and my scar seems to be shrinking . The gel makes my scar somewhat itchy , but rarley . I highly recommend this product .	1
I have a new scar on my neck from cervical surgery and I use this every night . Starting to see some change in the lumpy part . Hopefully it will smooth out .	1
I recently had surgery on my lumbar spine . Mederma is helping to cover up the scar that was left after surgery . When we are done with its application , we should not even be able to tell I had surgery .	1
This is a great product ... I was advised to use this after my surgery by a nurse friend of mine ... ... Thank you so much ... .	1
I love Vitamin E for so many things . This product was reasonably priced . The bottles are sturdy . The product has a very high IU and that is what I look for in Vitamin E .	1
I never try vitamin E oil before but I am using vitamin C serum which is good to follow with vitamin E oil especially at night time for better results , this oil is awesome , I just love it ! ! ! is very rich so just a few drops ( 2 to 3 ) covers my entire face , the bottle is small enough which makes it very convenient for traveling , some oils have a rancid smell , this oil smells a bit like lemon grass it 's a pleasure to apply it after my vitamin C serum , leaves my skin so smooth and dewy for the next morning . I highly recommend this product .	1
This oil is great ! ! ! Multi purpose ... I use this for my hair helps nouris my scalp & prevents breakage . On my skim this has helped lighten dark spots & keep skin tone balanced.. Good supplement can just take 5 drops orally ... The price is good esp if u do subscribe & save	1
Have bought e with less IU before but this stuff really gets the job done quickly . Rought skin sleared up over night .	1
I use ut on my face sometime when it gets very dry , and wash after a couple of hours . My skin feels very hydrated .	1
I use this as a preservative for my hair and skin mixtures I make . I do n't have any complaints about it . It gets the job done . This is my second or third time ordering this brand . It arrived quickly and well packaged . I do wish it was easier to find all natural vitamin E on Amazon though . I would buy that if I could find it on here but until then this is my go to preservative .	1
This is the most economical way to buy this product that I have found . The product is as advertised , brand name and packaging .	1
My doctor has me taking this product with omega 3 's instead of statins . It totally helps lower cholesterol - it works .	1
If you have high LDL cholesterol and you have not been able to reduce it with diet and exercise , this Slo-Niacin tablets will do the job . The slow release minimizes flashing that is normally associated with Niacin and the results are incredible . I have been trying to lower my Cholesterol for the last couple of years but with no success . I was stuck in the range of 230-235 and even though I was taking Flash-Free Niacin , my number was not dropping . Two months ago I found out by reading posts on the Internet that Flash-Free Niacin does not work for lowering cholesterol . So , I started looking for another way and found the Slo-Niacin which is regular niacin that is released slowly . This worked great . I took 1500 mg a day for a month and my cholesterol dropped from 233 to 130 . I was shocked by how well it worked . It makes you wonder why doctors prescribe drugs when a natural supplement like Niacin works so well .	1
My doc told me to use these for diabetic neuropathy . Have used a few bottles and ca n't tell much of a difference , but may have waited too late . Probably wo n't buy any more .	1
This slo niacin is worth every dime . I take 3 of them a day . Prescriptions were not able to lower my cholesterol at all , but these niacin , along with red yeast rice , coq10 and 1200mg DHA fish oil has brought my cholesterol levels down to perfect . Good and bad levels right where they want them . And It was all natural . I am happy and subscribing to my monthly shipments of slo niacin for a long time to come .	1
I have been using Slo Niacin for over 5 years . Walgreens recently stopped supplying the 750 mg. Was happy to see I stillcould get this doseage online .	1
First of all , the product is well tolerated and I am very pleased . Secondly , to all of you whiners that complained about the packaging : iron is a metal that can , like most metals , kill you if you overdose . There is no antidote . An OD can do irreparable harm to your liver . It is a slow , agonizing death . I do not have children , but I understand the reason for the safety packaging . Most OTC medicines will not kill you if OD . This one will . So , look at the bigger picture here and do n't overly focus on only yourself . There is a simple solution . It is called scissors . Personally , I do n't think they are even needed . The packets are a little difficult , but if you persevere , you might even find that you develop a little character ( a virtue ) in the process . : )	1
the supplement iron enables the body to produce energy . So if you feel a little sluggish , ( abnormal poor energy ) , you may not be getting enough iron in your diet , or either your body does n't process it effeciently.thankfully , you have this product . I have noticed it does provide a bit of a energy boost ( I 'm not completely tired at the end of the day as before ) . Try it , it might help you as well .	1
I have chronic iron deficiency anemia , and I always need to take supplements . I tried Slow Fe nearly a decade ago and could n't tolerate it . Instead , I took Ferro Sequels , which was a slow release ferrous fumarate , I believe.Well , I was in a pinch at the drugstore , and decided to give Slow Fe another try . See , I can always find Slow Fe on the shelves , but few stores near me stock Ferro Sequels , making it increasingly rare to find.Now , they do say 'new formula ' . So I 'm not sure if their active ingredient has changed over the past ten years or so , or if my body simply tolerates it better now , but I 've been on them for a week ( twice a day is my dosage ) and I 'm just fine . In fact , I 've decided to go with this brand , and subscribed to it today.Moral of the story is : if you tried it years ago and it did n't work for you , might be worth giving it a second chance.Oh , though I agree the packaging is terribly ! Honestly , ca n't we get a bottle ? Please ?	1
This is an item recommended by our family physician as an excellent source of iron for the diet . It is no longer available ... .why ?	1
Being constantly anemic , I always dread having to take Iron pills because they leave my stomach so upset . The Slow Fe tablets are pricey but they are worth it ! No stomach problems associated with iron at all ! My big complaint is that they are extremely hard to open . It is so time consuming and difficult . If you have arthritis , opening these will be a nightmare . I still think the benefits outweigh the cons . When I am bored , I stand and open 10 or so tablets at a time and put them in a pill box .	1
OK , so I tried to save some $ $ by getting the generic at my local store . Big mistake.Went back to the doctor and he recommended this brand by name , so I ordered it here because it was cheaper than my drug store.I am on my second box now and it has made a world of difference in how I feel and in my test results . I always thought generics were just the same as the name brands , but that is not the case for this supplement . I will be buying this brand again	1
I have really bad gas and this supplement is the only thing that helps keep it at bay , no matter what I eat . It tastes really good , unlike other brands of acidophilus I 've tried that you have to swallow . With this supplement you 'll definitely notice a difference in the way your body digests your food for sure !	1
We are big believers in acidophilus and have been taking this brand for years great for those who are n't big yogurt eaters and the flavor is great .	1
I got this for my mom who has trouble swallowing pills . These are chewable wafers and she really likes them . She tells me that they have a pleasant taste .	1
Been using these for years to prevent yeast infections . I love the flavor , keep them in the fridge and this is a great price too .	1
I prefer to use the kind that you keep in the fridge , but these are good for travel . I take double the dose because I 'm not as confident in shelf stable as I am the kind you chill . I 've been using this for years and am happy with the taste , as are my elementary age children .	1
For the most part , I like certain kinds of yogurt , but I find that I just ca n't eat it every day . I do n't like it THAT much . But I do want to take steps to keep my digestive system on track , and these small , sweet acidophilus chews are a great way to do just that . I actually take one every day , even if I do eat yogurt . Plus , the price can not be beat . It 's always great to be able to consume things that are good for you without totally breaking the bank .	1
Hard to fine this good-smelling and safe ( no harmful ingredients ) deodorant in stores . Glad Amazon carries it in bulk . You CBA still find it sometimes at Wal-mart .	1
-Powerful odor protection that lasts all day-Clean masculine scentI have sensitive skin and have experimented with many different deodorants to find those that offer good odor protection without inflaming my skin . In my search , there are 3 types that I can use regularly without a problem and out of those , Speed Stick Musk is my # 1 CHOICE ! ! To me it smells great . If you 've never smelled this , I think it closely resembles the scent of some kind of canned shaving foam . If you 've never thought about trying this because you 've smelled musk after-shave ... .do n't worry , it 's NOT LIKE THAT STUFF . The scent is VERY clean without being overly strong like some others . Recently , it seems that some deodorants try to concentrate more on smelling like cologne than being a product to rub on your pits.Speed Stick Musk is a clear solid so there is none of that white gunk that can grab onto your hairs and discolor your shirts . For me , I have observed that the odor protection is BETTER than any other I have tried which proves to me that expensive does n't mean better . This has EVERTHING I 'm looking for ... First and most importantly , it 's EFFECTIVE and GENTLE on my skin.Secondly , it has a fresh , clean scent.Lastly , it 's a GREAT value.This contains only six ingredients with stearyl alcohol being listed last and is thankfully ALUMINUM FREE ! . Maybe that 's why I have found it to be refreshingly gentle yet completely powerful . Whatever it is ... .I LOVE IT . For a guy that has never been completely brand-loyal , this is one of those brands where I make an exception .	1
I got the fresh scent for my husband . He always uses the Mennen Speed Sticks . At $ 2.50 a piece for the 3 oz . size , it is well worth it . Grocery stores charge at least $ 3 a piece . He only like the clear deodorant , not the white chalky kinds . These are perfect . Thanks to all the customer 's that helped me .	1
Since I bought this product I stink a lot less . Its a good buy for the money .. and this kind of speed stick is hard to find .	1
For as long as I can remember buying my own deodorant I have always bought Speed Stick as it was and still is a good buy just look for it on sale at a store I think amazon is on the high side I could be wrong check prices first .	1
This is for my husband , I shopped in the store and you can not beat the ease of shopping online . Wow .	1
I really like Speed Stick Deoderant - goes on clear - seems to work well - the price is great . I saved so much money than buying it local . I am very happy with Speed Stick and can highly recommend .	1
What can on say ? This is a bargain . I 've been using this product for over 40 years , and will continue to us for another 40 if I can .	1
Had a hard time finding it in the stores . Was glad to get it on here and at that price . Will do it again when my hubby runs out .	1
Wow ! ! Great price for this pack of six 3.25 sticks of deodorant . Mennen surprised me with this musk deodorant & the quality of it.This deodorant is long lasting & works very well in all situations . This goes on clear & leaves no type of stain on any type of shirt . One stick is long lasting even after applying it several times a day.This is a great way to stock up at an affordable price . I am very , very particular about what I buy & use but could not find anything negative to say about this item .	1
Better price point and saved myself a trip to the store . Based on my buying the same item in the store I feel I saved at least $ 4.00 .	1
After CVS and Walgreens stopped carrying this I was wondering where to get it.This is a good product for men and is on par with the Jovan deodorant which is also a great men 's product.The Speed Stick is for the days I expect to have one tough day of physical labor and it meets the task.Good item , good price .	1
I 've been using Speed Stick deodorant regular for years . It is effective at killing stink . It has a nice smell when you apply it . The smell is not overpowering and it is not noticeable after a few minutes ( I have smell sensitivity ) . This product does not stain clothes or leave any marks . I tried Tom 's and Trader Joe 's natural deodorant but neither of those worked and I could smell my own BO long before the day was over . While I like to buy products that have no animal testing , I draw the line with BO and use my Speed Stick deodorant . It 's great for men or women and it 's inexpensive .	1
This might be meant for men , but I 'm not a man and I use it . : ) I do n't want to use anything with aluminum . Even the all-natural `` mineral '' stuff is 100 % alum , which defeats the purpose . So , I went to the store and looked at all the deodorants . All had artificial colors and scents except this one . It does have a scent , but it 's natural and very mild ( I do n't smell whiffs of it during the day ) . It 's not 'manly ' or 'womanly . ' It works , but you still might perspire because of the lack of aluminum crud.As for the all-natural non-alum deodorants and anti-perspirants which are available ( Tom 's , Kiss My Face , Jason , etc . ) , they simply do n't work for me . They seem nice but I perspire even more , and body odor becomes a problem ( which is is n't with the Speed Stick ) .I do n't give it 5 stars because it contains propylene glycol . I 'd still rather have that than aluminum .	1
I was worried about this being a glass bottle and it getting damaged in shipping , but it was plastic . This stuff smells great and my wife loves it . I use it after every shave . It does sting a little , but it leaves my face feeling great !	1
It does indeed soothe , cool ( I 'm not sure about & # 34 ; tone , & # 34 ; I 'm still pretty flabby ) but it is a great basic , classic scent that many women find attractive ( maybe bc it reminds them of their father 's scent ) .	1
I only use this aftershave in the summer because it tends to dry my skin in the brutal Chicago winter . It works great after a nice straight razor shave ; smells great and cools my skin . It 's alcohol-based , but I 'm surprised it does n't sting as much as I expected . Since the dispensing hole is a bit too big , I cover half of it with my thumb before squirting it into my hand . One day , a female acquaintance hugged me and commented I smelled really good . Two weeks later she asked me out ; )	1
HEY ! ! I am an Aqua Velva Man and absolutely love this stuff , been using it for over 50 years . This is a true after shave lotion classic . Not quite sure how many women that have been attracted to me because of Aqua Velva , I do know for sure that it 's just to many to count . Ha . Not sure how long this has been around but the Williams Company ran a paper advertisement , taken from a 1949 magazine , which features Ralph Bellamy of Detective Story and Ezio Pinza of South Pacific for Aqua Velva After Shave Lotion . I 'm sure you all remember Ralph Bellamy and Ezio Pinza from the 40 's right.There slogan was `` There is nothing like an AQUA VELVA MAN `` and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when I was a young man . It 's just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.The only negative about Aqua Velva is it does not last very long . Usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated . The more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have Ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.At any rate this is a great classic after shave with a wonderful refreshing odor , give it a try you might just like it.Note : : : ; Some reviewers mention this 7oz size now comes in a plastic container , I just bought one in Wal-Mart and it was glass .	1
Good price for the amount of blades . Have been using this type of blade for about 10 years . They work well last long and does the job .	1
What happened to the generic razor blades that used to be available ? They 're nowhere to be found anymore . This was the best deal I found .	1
These Sensor Gillette razors are impossible to find in stores , so not sure if they are still made . Nevertheless , once I find a razor I like I try to continue using it . This is the best & # 34 ; women 's razor & # 34 ; with refillable blades I 've found , so I 'm glad to have found the replacement blades . Because they are Gillette , they always work well .	1
I have been using this cartridge for almost years now . They do n't sell this cartridge anymore on any supermarket , groceries , etc .	1
Ok - those commercials where the guy uses a shave gel and girls go nuts ? Guys - this is it . Buy it .	1
The 6-pack of shaving gel is a great savings on a terrific product . The product is excellent and the price saved me money by allowing me to stock up on something I would have bought elsewhere for more money . Shipping and packaging were excellent .	1
I had been using another brand of gel for quite a while . This is as good if not better than what I was previously using . I like buying them in bulk packs also ! ! !	1
We use this toothpaste for two reasons ; it works and it 's inexpensive . We normally keep multiple boxes of this toothpaste around the house and at this point probably have around five or six unopened boxes in reserve.The toothpaste has a pleasant taste and is only moderately foamy which , in my opinion , simplifies the whole tooth brushing process.As another reviewer has pointed out a consumer testing organization has given the toothpaste high marks ; that I 'll have to admit was the reason I first bought this brand . According to the box the product is made in Mexico and distributed in the USA by Colgate-Palmolive . It contains sodium fluoride .24 % for anticavity protection.We have been pleased with this product for years and see no reason to change .	1
Now how often do THOSE two words go together ? Not that often in a toothpaste ! Consumer Reports got me to try Ultra Brite but the results keep my buying it . I 've been using it for years and personally I 've never noticed any whitening effects *but* it makes my teeth feel clean and maintains a healthy mouth . Rarely any dental issues here in years . My teeth look great and I frequently get compliments on my smile . These days I use a whitening paste half the time but I keep Ultra Brite in the rotation too.UB has a nice minty taste that is not totally over powering - meaning I can actually taste food again within the hour . The paste is a nice consistency and does n't produce too much foam even with my Oral B electric toothbrush . The price ca n't be beat - usually a dollar or less locally.Very pleased with this product and highly recommended .	1
I use a variety of toothpastes ( cough ... whatever 's cheap ... cough ) and this is what I 'd call a `` throwback '' toothpaste . It 's very simple stuff down to the flavor , no crystals , no magic strips , no flavors from an alternate universe , no voodoo magic , just toothpaste that feels like the stuff they used to hand out on international flights . It 's fairly light , tastes like some sort of generic mint , and cleans very well . Apparently it 's good at whitening . But the best part is that it 's dirt cheap . It 's a dollar for a big tube of toothpaste , basically . Much better than the other cheap toothpastes ( except one of the aquafresh varieties ) .Only drawback is that it 's made in mexico ( if that bothers you ) . I 've never had a problem with the quality control on this toothpaste .	1
I ordered this a year ago for my grandmother who has arthritis & bruises easily . Once she tried it , there was no other alternative that worked as good for her ( she was using other topical creams & some burned her skin , or left a rash ) . This soaks in quickly , does n't burn or irritate the skin & actually does lighten her bruises within a couple days of using this day & night ( she bumps into anything & a bruise starts . Immediately she puts this on & the bruise either does n't happen or it fades away in a couple days ) .Now I am ordering again because I use this before & after workouts , when I get bruises and also to ease out the swelling & redness of acne on my face ( yes , just 2 times a day on clean skin I rub this in & within a week my large , angry acne marks are gone ) .This stuff works quickly on pain , does n't stain , is all natural & we could not be happier in my home using this product .	1
Of course everyone has a different response to treatments but this has been the go to gel for minor scraps & bruises for the family.It 's amazing as upon immediate application its soothes the wound and eases pain , all while healing and lessening the presence of a scar.It 's a must for first aide kits and medicine cabinets especially if you have kids.I even used it on minor burns and yes , it works like a charm.Gr8 product ! ! Also if you have body aches , cramps or muscle pain try arnica tabletsArnica Montana 30x 250 Tabletsnow these little tablets out weigh any other pain relief tablet OTC .	1
This is my Go-To relief for muscular pain and discomfort relief . Have used this for a few years now and would n't be without it . The relief is quick and lasts plus it is absorbed quickly which is what I 'm after . Use it primarily on my neck and shoulder muscles but find it 's beneficial for any muscular aches or pains elsewhere . Excellent product .	1
It has a nice cooling effect . TriVita makes a icier cream but this one works nicely similar to BenGay .	1
Hey , I am a born skeptic . But I think that this product actually works . And it is easy to apply . The only down side is a somewhat unpleasant aroma , but away from the nose this does not matter . My pain is most often in the lower back . If I apply the gel and then sit in a chair that encourages good posture , the pain is relieved within a quarter hour . If you have tried cooling compounds , heating compounds , etc. , and do not have a solution for pain yet , try this gel , and hopefully it will work for you as it does for me .	1
This arnica cream is very refreshing to tired and achy muscles . It smells a lot like witch hazel and works very much the same way . It does the job in about 24 hours , not immediate . A little massage works well on the affected area to make this cream work . I like it and will continue to use it .	1
I use the Boericke & Tafel Arniflora Arnica Gel to less the pain and shorten the appearance of bruises . Simply said , & # 34 ; It works. & # 34 ;	1
Wrote a review , somehow many do n't make it as done so write this to show I am annoyed and get it off the undone list.See the ratings , that alone says it all .	1
I have severe fibromyalgia and am basically bed-ridden . If I have to do anything physical , my pain is increased a lot . This oderless gel helps a bit in relieving the pain and stiffness after carrying something heavy . It 's probably more effective if I use it for the everyday pain that my pain medication does n't touch . It boils down to having to have a whole arsenol of pain relievers , and with all of them together it can be quite effective .	1
I saw some reviews stating that they believe `` Homeopathic '' here to mean it has minute , or no actual ingredients in it . This is not true . When these kinds of products state homeopathic , it means that they are following pharmaceutical guidelines . This is important.I researched , and this product has 8 % arnica .	1
For an active athlete and avid lifter like me , arnica is a bit of a homeopathic miracle . This is my favorite topical arnica solution , because it comes in the hard-to-find gel form -- which is easier to apply than the many cremes .	1
This is a very good product and i am grateful to get it . many years ago i was told about this product and surprised the efficent properties that this product gives	1
Have used this Homeopathic gel for decades . As a professionally trained Modern , and Classical Ballet , dancer for over 30 + years , I have sworn by this for preventative as well as helping to speed-up recovery/healing time of sports-type & over-use injuries . Ii is essential to us dancers and athletes alike . Great for contusions , bruises and over-use injuries . Recommend . Only remember to remove all oils and perfumes from skin BEFORE using , and to be diligent enough to use in the morning and evening both . for best results .	1
This product is great for reducing the appearance of bruises with repeated applications . I apply it after using my Rumble Roller and it helps immensely . I do wish that they made a bigger size since I am going through it so quickly !	1
I bruise easily , and they last forever ( sometimes months ) . This will make my bruise disappear within a week . The one thing I 've noticed is that while the bruise will disappear , the area may still be sore like a normal bruise ( although the soreness wo n't last as long as a normal bruise ) . Definitely worth the effort and cost ! ! ! I had gum surgery several years ago , which is where I learned of this . I applied both the topical gel , and took the small pellets both before and after surgery . My jaw never bruised ( which was a miracle in itself ) , and had minimal swelling which went away in a couple days .	1
Arnica has always been known to relieve muscular pain , Boericke & Tafel is a great brandlike other well known brand from France . Love this one ~	1
Two months ago I broke my arm . I have been using THIS brand of arnica for a few years now . Since I have n't been able to leave the house during this time period , I went exploring to find more of it . My arm is healing nicely because of the arnica . Thank you for having this brand available and for the promptness with which it arrived .	1
This product was recommend to me by a Chiropractor , due to my sprain thumb . I bought this product and used it on my knee and an inflamed arm and it really helped the inflammation .	1
I was having a few challenges with dry skin and scalp so I thought I would try this . My scalp has dramatically improved since I 've been taking these and it 's the only change I 've made-so I would have to attribute the positive trend toward the vitamins . I will be ordering these again and will continue using as part of my daily regime .	1
I 've been taking this every day for a couple of months now . I 'm not 100 % sure it 's doing anything , but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day . Others I 've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects . This is the only one that has n't , so I 'll keep taking it.Ca n't speak to the skin benefits because I do n't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place . My skin does look better overall , but I 'm doing some topical things to it as well .	1
I have been lifting for about 3 years now ( benching about 95lbs when I started ) and about a year ago I hit a wall where I could not seem to increase my max anymore . So then about 6 months ago I started using muscle milk , glutamine powder , BCAA pills , and this Creatine Fuel . When Before I started this regimen I was maxing out on the bench at about 185 and just last week I did 245 for the first time and I have increased in pretty much every other area as well . I have also noticed that my arms look and feel much fuller , they are up to 16 inches now and I hope to continue my journey and maybe someday in the next year hit the 300 mark on bench and make good gains in other areas as well .	1
I use creatine to help recover from harder workouts , and , at lower doses , to help with fatigue . Seems to work in a noticeable way for both applications .	1
I really like Creatine and I take it in a powder form in water from another sorce so I ca n't really tell if this is working or not . It has good stuff in it though . Shipping was very fast too .	1
I take it my wife and my father who is 87 takes it daily . Results are more energy better work outs more muscle strength .	1
I have trouble falling asleep , and I have used ambien , Tylenol PM , and Unisom . All work ; however , they leave me a little groggy in the morning . I had very little success with melatonin in the pill form . I heard about the liquid form , ordered it , and I am having much better results with it ... ..generally falling asleep within 20 - 30 minutes after head hits the pillow .	1
This was the first time I tried Melatonin and I really like it . I have trouble swallowing pills , so this was perfect for me . It has helped me to sleep all night .	1
I bought this for my nine year old Pom. , who I think might have alopecia . I 've been giving here a dose for about two weeks and I 'm starting to notice some fur coming back in on her hid quarters , but ca n't be sure if its this or fish oil and missing link I 've been mixing in her food .	1
Very helpful in combination with other sleep aids . I have been using Melatonin for quite some time and rely upon it every night .	1
Has a pleasant taste and most importantly works very well . it really helps me to remain asleep through the night as I tend to get up at least once and then have trouble falling back to sleep if I do n't use . I will continue to purchase this .	1
I have read from a lot of people saying it does n't leave you groggy but if I take more than half a teaspoon I find it makes me that way . I do n't take melatonin unless I cant sleep at all or if I am not tired but it starts to work pretty fast no matter how much I take . I guess since its a liquid it affects you quicker since I have used the pill form before . My 3 year old who is autistic has problems sleeping and staying asleep and as far as getting to sleep she will usually go to sleep in about 10 to 15 minutes . This was recommended over medication from our doctor which is what we prefer . She still wakes up some nights but I do n't think it has too much to do with the melatonin as it is with her . Overall I recommend this to help people sleep naturally without resorting to medication .	1
Natrol 's liquid melatonin is a hormone the body manufactures from the brain neurotranmitter serotonin . Serotonin gives the mind a peaceful satisfied feeling . The human body secretes melatonin from the pineal gland . The release of melatonin is stimulated by darkness and promotes sleep when the hormone levels are sufficient . 1 to 3 mg ( 1-3 drops ) of Melatonin will work to promote a sleepy feeling and aids in sleep . This product instructs one to take 4 mg of Melatonin , which is the highest dose of Melatonin recommended by most sleeping aid products.I have found that the occasional use of Melatonin has helped me to fall asleep easier . I do n't believe this product should be used on a nightly basis , as regular daily use actually inhibits the natural production of Melatonin in one 's body.I have had no hang-over effect in using Melatonin . Some sleep aids have Diphenhydramine as the active ingredient and these give a noticable hang-over effect the following morning . For those with intractable insomnia , I suppose a Diphenhydramine product and a Melatonin product could be combined to give a turbo-charged sleeping pill . I have not tried this combination myself , but it should help anyone with chronic insomnia fall asleep.konedog	1
My 9 yr. old son has had trouble sleeping for several years now . He just ca n't seem to turn his brain off and was always up too long at night . His bedtime has been consistent at 8 during the school year and between 8:30 & 9 during the summer , but he would still be up in his room until after 10 sometimes . Lights out and everything . Just staring at the ceiling . Or he 'd make several bathroom trips just to have something to do . There were many nights when he 'd come up and say he just could n't get to sleep . I do n't give my kids caffeine or too much sugar and they get plenty of exercise . Well he was diagnosed this year w/ Asperger 's Syndrome so that explains a lot of things but his pediatrician recommended melatonin to help him fall asleep . I tried the pills but he just ca n't get them down so I figured I 'd try this.As with most anything you buy , it 's got its pros & cons.Pros : -This has helped so much in helping him fall asleep more quickly . He 's not been coming up at all to say he ca n't sleep . When I ask him how he slept he tells me `` really well . `` -Since he 's sleeping better at night he 's been up with the rest of us in the morning without being a crab because he 's tired.Cons : -This stuff does n't taste like raspberry or vanilla . I 've tasted it myself and it was like something you should put in a shot glass . We 've kinda worked around that ( my son has issues with strong tastes and was spitting it out the first time . ) I will have the melatonin ready for him while he gets a glass of water . I 'll hold his nose , pour the melatonin in his mouth , he 'll swallow it , I 'll let go of his nose , & then he 'll drink the water to wash the taste out . Maybe a bit of a production , but you do what you can . He 's okay with it this way.-Cost . This is more expensive than the same amount for Tylenol or Motrin , and it 's used much more often.Overall this has helped so much that the pros far outweigh the cons . I 'll purchase again when we 're low . Oh , & I 've started taking the pill form that he did n't like & found that they help me fall asleep much easier too .	1
I 've used melatonin for about 20 years and I believe it is what keeps me looking young ! It helps me sleep and it helps my son to sleep when hardcore sleeping pills would not . I love melatonin because you do n't have to worry about drug interaction !	1
This is an excellent source of daily vitamins ; only note here is to be aware that this vitamin contains iron .	1
These are great vitamins with much higher doses than other brands . I 've been taking them for about 3 months now and feel a real difference in my sense of well being . One note though ; they have made me feel nauseas more than some lower dose vitamins I 've taken . I 'm not sure if it 's the higher dose or that it 's in gel cap form . As with any vitamins DO N'T take them on an empty stomach or after eating only something like yogurt or a piece of fruit . I 've taken the time to write out the levels of each type of vitamin because that was something I wanted to know before purchasing . Please note they might occasionally change their formula but this is from the label of the vitamins I bought in late 2011 : Vitamin A - 4000IU - 80 % ( from Beta Carotene ) Vitamin A - 6000IU - 120 % ( from Retinyl palminate ) Vitamin C - 150 mg - 250 % ( from ascorbic acid ) Vitamin D - 400 IU - 100 % ( from cholecalciferol ) Vitamin E - 100 % IU - 333 % ( from d-alpha tocopheryl acid succinate ) Thiamin - 25 mg - 1667 % ( from thiamin mononitrate ) Riboflavin - 25 mg - 1471 % Niacin - 100 mg - 500 % ( from niacinamide ) Vitamin B6 - 1250 % ( from pyridoxine hydrochloride ) Folic Acid - 800 mcg - 200 % Vitamin B12 - 100 mcg - 1667 % ( from cynocobalamin ) Biotin - 300 mcg - 100 % Pantothenic Acid - 50 mg - 500 % ( from d-calcium pantothenate ) Calcium - 25 mg - 3 % ( from calcium carbonate and calcium citrate ) Iron - 10 mg - 56 % ( from carbonyl iron ) Iodine - 150 mcg - 100 % ( from potassium iodine ) Magnesium - 7.2 mg - 2 % ( from magnesium oxide and magnesium aspartate ) Zinc - 15 mg - 100 % ( from zinc picolinate ) Selenium - 200 mcg - 286 % ( from sodium selenate ) Copper - 2 mg - 100 % ( from copper gluconate ) Manganese - 5mg - 200 % ( from manganese gluconate ) Chromium - 200 mcg - 167 % ( from chromium chloride ) Molybdenum - 150 mcg - 200 % ( from sodium molybdate ) Choline - 10 mg - + ( from choline bitartrate ) Inositol - 10 mg - +FloraGLO Lutein - 500 mct - ++ = Daily Value ( DV ) not establishedOther ingredients : Gelatin , Purified Water , Alginic Acid , Croscarmellose Sodium , Potassium Citrate , Soy Lecithin , MCT , Magnesium Silicate , Vegetable Stearic Acid , Silica , Magnesium Stearate , Potassium Aspartate.1 per day = recommended dose	1
I have bought this brand before at a health food store in the city where I used to live . I was thrilled to find it on line at Amazon . It came quickly and well-packaged . I will be a steady customer	1
My doctor who is wholistic in her approach told me I HAD to get these vitamins . She gave all sorts of scientific reasons , I do n't remember any of them ( ! ) except she said they have just about every nutrient you need . I do know that I can take them without food and have NO stomach upset . Also , I have NEVER had long fingernails . They never grew very long and when they did grow , they peeled and split . No polish or treatment helped . I have always taken vitamins before but a few months after I started these , I noticed my nails were stronger and growing . I now have to file them down as they get too long . I ca n't understand why my nails would suddenly change so drastically-so I am attributing it to these vitamins as I 've made no other changes I can think of.And if they are the reason my nails are so strong now , imagine what it does to the insides ! If it is the vitamins , then they have a pretty awesome product ! Plan to continue taking them !	1
Been using these for years and they 're great . Although there is the occasional vitamin-flavored burp if you forget to take them with enough food . Overall though , still some of the better multivitamins out there .	1
After coming down with reflux a couple of years back , I had to discontinue my regular one a day with iron type vitamin as I found it was causing stomach problems . About a year ago , I started using Andrew Lessman 's 'hair skin and nails ' vitamins daily due to menopausal symptoms . They seemed to work . I still felt I needed a regular daily vitamin with iron so I went back to my old stand by . Again , they made me sick . So , after some research , I found these vitamins . I took them for over a week straight and felt no stomach discomfort . After that , I decided to continue on with Lessman 's vitamins but did n't want to take both daily ( was afraid I 'd be taking too much of something ) . So , I now daily alternate between the two and this seems to be working well . Because I took vitamins for 20 years , I felt my body was dependent on the vitamins/minerals . Also , I take a natural progesterone cream for the menopausal symptoms . I 'm now 51 years old and once again feel 27 ! ! ! I think I found the right combination to help me through these 'transitional ' years . Because of the iron , I take this vitamin mid day after a meal or snack ( wo n't tempt fate ! ) . I highly recommend these vitamins as I continue to feel good and , after nearly a month , there is no stomach upset for my sensitive stomach .	1
These will make your pee bright yellow and fill your body full of vitamins . It 's my favorite multi . .	1
Many years ago , I did a lot of research trying to decide which multi-vitamin would be the best one for me , and chose TwinLab Daily One.I do n't like taking pills since I have trouble swallowing them , so I ruled out any that needed to be taken more than once a day , even though it really is more beneficial to take vitamins in divided doses.My other requirements were:1 . Capsules , because they are fully assimilated in the body , unlike most pressed tablets that also require additional unwanted fillers.2 . Must contain at least minimally optimal amounts of the most beneficial vitamin/mineral/supplements.3 . Quality/Reputable Company . An MD ( not affiliated with , or endorsing TwinLab ) noted that TwinLab uses pharmaceutical quality ingredients and processing methods . I 'm sorry I do n't remember who it was ( but it was in a book I was was reading about a specific health issue that this Dr. also experienced ) , but I thought I should mention it because it did influence my decision to purchase this.3 . AffordableNotes:1 . I usually getTwinLab Daily One Caps Multi-Vitamins and Multi-Minerals without Iron , Capsules , 180-Count Bottleand alternate them with these because I do n't want to get too much iron , but I do n't eat many iron-rich foods , so depending on my diet I take these a few times a week.2 . I do recommend and supplement these with 2x's/dayCarlson Norwegian Cod Liver Oil Lemon 500mlfor important Omega-3 's and Chewable Calcium Citrate with Magnesium that I get from VitaCost . There are other supplements that I take , but I think these seem to be the most universally important to note.3 . If you do n't mind taking them twice a day , TwinLab Daily Two Caps , with Iron , Capsules , 180 capsulesorTwinLab Daily Two Caps , without Iron , Capsules , 180 capsulesare a good choice.Bottom Line : If you are looking for a once-a-day multiple vitamin I recommend this one or the one without iron .	1
i have been using twin lab daily one caps with iron for years , i love them the best thing about buying them here is there 20.00 cheaper here then in heatlh food store ! ! !	1
I have found over the years that Twin-Lab products are top quality . The amount of vitamins in a particular brand can vary from dense , i.e . high levels , to & # 34 ; why did I bother buying this ? & # 34 ; levels . TL always comes thru .	1
I 've been taking this for a number of years now . As far as I know it 's a good product . I have never had problems with it .	1
I like Twinlab products a lot . They 're good quality and fairly priced . I have this on subscribe and save . Highly recommend .	1
I have used these before in the city where I previously lived . I was thrilled to find them on the Amazon website . I think they are the best I have found .	1
This was a re-order , I get this regularly - do n't miss a pill . Makes me feel better ! My Doctor recommended them . Will continue to use them , great service .	1
I try to reseach vitamins and supplements before buying as as there are a ton of scams out there . This product is very good , but after trying it , I ca n't really say it made any real difference . I find I prefer a multi that has less concentrations of minerals and more of the basic vitamins .	1
There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab 's , and they 're probably a whole lot better , too . However , I do n't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine , where you do n't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take , I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus . It contains a month 's supply of vitamins , minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I 'm one of those people who can not swallow thick `` horse pills . '' I have no problem with this multi . It is a rather thin , oblong capsule , and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way , it 's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin , and this one fulfills that need .	1
have used these for years , after a cancer bout . I finally got my immune system back to fighting for itself	1
I did not notice anything different about this multivitamin . I read the reviews and anticipated noticing a difference . They are expensive so I will will probably go back to my drug-store brand . They equally had the same effect .	1
So many multi 's are to large to swallow..this capsule is perfect for me . I also can open l capsule and divide into 2 daily doses if stomach problems are present .	1
Consumer groups have a lot of info on line about which vitamins are most effectively absorbed.I 'll save you the pain of what I went through reviewing the top 100 vitamins out there : Efficacy of vitamins ranges over a wide scale . The best cost perhaps $ 3 a day to use . The worst do the job 10 % or less as well as the best ones . Name brand rarely coincides with effectiveness.These are powder in a capsule , so they absorb rapidly and do their job well . Cost is reasonable , too.What I found after a lot of research , was these occupy a unique niche between the dollars-a-day designer vitamins and the pennies a day junk , offering nearly the performance of the former at nearly the price of the latter.Enjoy ! It 's great having quality vitamins and not paying exorbitant prices.Recommended - and used - for years . `` It 's all the vitamin you 'll ever need ! `` To your health !	1
This product fills out multi vitamin need . It is a bargain . Good delivery . I like the glass bottle . We appreciate the quality .	1
This is my personal favorite daily multi-vitamin . I require an iron-free vitamin and this fits the bill . This pill does NOT upset mt stomach . I highly recommend this product .	1
I take 3 softgels each day and maintain healthy diet along with some exercise . I noticed that it helps to maintain my midsection - however its not going to work if you overeat or do not work out.I should try the 4 gel option.The first time I ordered this , the bottle was not sealed hence the 4 stars	1
This is a great product , when you understand what it 's useful for . Anyone who expects fast weight loss , has not read the articles on CLA . I bought this product mainly for two reasons : ( 1 ) I read `` The Cure for Heart Disease '' ( a great book , by the way ) and the cardiologist who wrote it recommended CLA because it can reduce inflammation in the body , lead to a better proportion of lean body mass to fat in the body , lead to a better balance of blood fats which can affect heart and blood vessel health , and lead to - very slow however - weight loss . I do not need to lose weight but I do want to lose body fat , as I am `` skinny fat '' and while I exercise daily to work towards this goal , I can use a little help from this CLA product . Also with heart disease history in my family , this supplement makes sense for that reason . I have tried another brand of CLA however that other brand , really upset my stomach , even though it was 1000mg and therefore less than this product . The Natrol CLA at 1200 mg does not bother my stomach at all and I am very happy with it . I am here at amazon to buy my 2nd bottle . The price is also terrific . I would recommend strongly that anyone who is interested in CLA read articles on the web and in magazines like Oxygen , Fitness , Men 's Health , etc . Also the book mentioned above is well worth a read , and contains plenty of information on CLA .	1
I first bought this brand from a store to see how it would fair with me and was surprised when I started developing a one pack under my fat . Mind you I 'm a woman that lifts a couple thousand pounds a week . I also noticed this gave my muscles more fuel to lift . I never had to strain real hard.I ran out but ended buying the spring valley brand of tonalin cla from walmart . It 's 2000 mg & 50 capsules & 12 $ , take two pills twice daily . I thought I was getting the better deal , but for some reason that brand just does n't work well for me like the Natrol brand had done . So I 'm going to buy the brand from here and use the Subscribe and Save with 2 bottles a month . I can get free shipping that way too.Some people say this does n't work for them , but it did for me . I did n't lose 10 pounds in a week but could feel my muscle tension increase . At work I call this brand my magic pill , it makes lifting so much easier and quicker . I no longer have to strain .	1
this product is great ; it is exactly what it advertises and I would surely recommend it to all my friends	1
I am a strong believer that different things work for different people 's body , no two bodies are the same , but when I read that people split a bottle with a friend or took not even a full bottle and it did n't work I 'm not surprised . Some research into the use of the active ingredient says to take the full dose for at least 6 weeks before you give up because it does n't work for you . It is impossible to achieve with one bottle if you are taking the 3-4 you really need . I have n't experienced success with most things that other people do , just counting calories and going for walks for example does nothing to help me lose weight . I am working out , I am eating right , and was having weightloss success , but this product has helped cut my belly measurements in a way that I was n't having success at before taking it . I went from frustratingly seeming to lose from everywhere but my belly to taking off two inches after adding this to my regimen . I imgaine if it works for me it will work for many other poeple , but there is never one product that works for every single person .	1
I have been usuing this for a while and it seems to help me loose weight . I take it three times a day and went down a pants size . It is easy to swollow and had no taste . The price is great and I will buy again	1
High quality but seems a little on the thin side . Never the less , it works as claimed . I purchased it for back support during my workouts . It does make you sweat too . Good product at a fair price .	1
I started using this 2.5 yrs ago because I heard it could help me lose weight . 77 lbs later I am thrilled ... not only did I lose weight my cholesterol corrected itself . My numbers were horrid . I now take no cholesterol meds . This stuff increased my HDL to 60 , up from 40 . HDL is the cholesterol that doctors say you can not increase . Ha ha ! Blew my doc away !	1
I started using this in combination with Raspberry Ketones and found it made me stronger in my workouts . I have also been able to keep weight off with it . But remember , nothing is a miracle pill . I use it in combination with regular workouts and watch what I eat . I keep track of calories and always expend more calories than I use . If you are not wanting to loose weight then taking this along with the Keytones about 30 minutes prior to workout should help you to be able to move more weight .	1
This is my second month taking this . I stopped taking the green bean coffee bean pill with svetol because it did nothing for me . I take this right before I eat . I lost 2 lbs last week . I did nothing different . So I hope the trend continues helping me lose some weight . I do some kind of exercise everyday .	1
I 've been taking CLA for about 5 weeks . I 'm quite obese and I 've noticed that my belly fat is shrinking more than usual when I 'm restricting calories . I am eating about 1800 calories a day for the last four months and losing about 3-4 lbs a month . That is fine since I 've lost hundreds of lbs . over the years and always gained it back . What I 'm hoping is that I wo n't gain it back this time ; that I can just continue eating the same , 1800 , and my body , which fights me to gain , will be happy with the lower weight . One weird thing that I have noticed is that when I take Tylenol , it 's does n't work anymore . I take it 2-3 times a week for arthritis . I ca n't take NSAIDS so that is unfortunate .	1
I purchased this product because I have decided to be in TOTAL GREAT HEALTH , I did not want to start off with anything that would give me the shakes or have me feeling weird or bad , I wanted something natural to help with my stomach fat , I can say that I have changed my diet , smoothie in the mornings , water all day , and a full course meal with protein and vegetables , no bread and no sugar , walking every day for 30-45 minutes , I have have seen a tremendous result . I feel much better and I am determined to obtain total health .	1
Needed more to tell if really worked but comes highly recommended by Dr. Jim Stoppani ( Muscle and Fitness magazine ) aka `` The Superman Workout '' author .	1
I enjoy that one soft gel is a serving . For me this was a good value , especially with being 1200mg per serving as opposed to something were you have to swallow 2 or 3 pills for the same serving.This is a very effective form of CLA with Tonalin and for the price it is n't bad . However , if foul smells bother you , DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT . The bottle I received left such a strong odor in the room long after I took my pill and closed the jar , that I can not take it out of the house.It 's effectiveness and ease to take is great , it just really needs to stop smelling so foul.PROS : Simple to takeEasy on stomachEasy to swallowEffectiveCONS : Bad flavorBad Smell	1
This is a very sweet tasting bar . Really it is like eating cookie dough . it 's delicious and nutritious..	1
I usually do n't buy chocolate-flavored protein bars because 1 ) I tend to eat them for breakfast , so I prefer more fruit-type flavors , and 2 ) I find that the chocolate bars tend to be more artificial tasting . However , I saw one of these bars on sale , and because I absolutely love mocha , I decided to give it a try.Taste-wise , this bar is excellent . It is rich , chocolate-y , and has a very good , distinct mocha flavor too . It was pleasantly chewy without having the overly nougat-like consistency that some protein bars have . Overall , I definitely enjoyed this bar , and from a flavor perspective , I would not hesitate to buy it again.The reason I gave this bar 4 stars instead of 5 was due to the nutritional profile . At 200 calories , it is about what you would expect from a protein bar ; I was fine with that . But both the fat content ( 7 grams , including 3.5 grams saturated ) and the sugar content ( 17 grams , or over 3 teaspoons ) were a little on the high side to me . Some bars include fiber ; this one has & lt ; 1 gram . It does have 15 grams of protein , which was a big plus.So , in the end , I probably will buy this bar again , but I will limit myself to using it occasionally rather than as a more regular , healthy part of my diet .	1
I 'm always the type that needs to snack on items through the day to avoid headaches and feeling fatigue . I 'm very physically active and do n't have time to spend for large meals so need something filling , easy to take with me , and is delicious . The chocolate craze is essentially like a desweetened chocolate bar for me . I just ca n't tire of the taste , it 's the best I 've ever had with these nutritional bars . I only wish they were cheaper as it 's quite pricey . But as the saying , you do get what you pay for .	1
I 've tried A LOT of different bars over the years . Many serve a specific function like `` high protein '' for after resistance training or `` 150 calories or less '' for a light snack . In the general , `` meal replacement '' category , I always seem to come back to Balance Bars , and Peanut Butter in particular . It 's not overly sweet like many of bars that try to be more like candy bars and at 200 calories , it satisfies perfectly . I am a Peanut Butter fan and this bar tastes really good . You 're not going to think you are eating a spoonful of PB , but the taste , consistency and chewiness all make you feel like you 've eaten something . Sometimes bars just disappear and you wonder if you ever ate anything at all ! As the name says - this is a nice nutritionally BALANCED bar that will fill in as a nice snack .	1
I have been through many brands and flavors of protein and fiber bars . My preference is towards the smooth varieties ( not nutty or crunchy ) and the chocolate raspberry is one of my favorite flavors ( along with chocolate chip . )	1
I 've reviewed a lot of these products , and most have some common flaws : Bad , `` unnatural , '' or chemical-like taste ( especially in the metallic after-taste ) , woefully stale , cardboard-like texture , high fat content , and relatively high price.Given all the chemicals listed below , it came as a great surprise that this is a DELICIOUS snack , certainly one of the best of the many I 've tried . No strange aftertaste , and real hints of honey ( the peanut is a little harder to discern ) . The texture is soft but with some heft , and , on entry one senses honey , sugar , a hint of peanut and oil , and a vague spicy background . IT 's excellent , and not as sweet as the similar but too-sugary ( for my taste ) yoghurt honey peanut flavor.My only complaints ( and this comes from the head , not the taste , Bud ) are the plethora of vitamin and mineral additives ( just a personal preference there ) , and the 3.5 grams of saturated fat , and 17 grams of sugar . However , this is within the range , I believe , of most of these products.On the positive side , you get 14 grams of sugar , and high percentage of the recommended daily values of a range of vitamins and minerals . Have one of these with a 2-3 lasses of water and you will feel full . Also great as a post work-out pick-me-up . Of course , please consult your health care provider for specific recommendations for your personal use.I 'm not sure how they did it , but Balance has set a new bar ( pun intended ) for taste !

You like peanut butter but hate all the fat that goes with ot ? then this is the bar for you . Its like eating a bar of peanut butter with no guilt . Sweet & Salty . I only wish there was more texture such as actual full peanuts inside . But I digress this is the most accurate representation of any flavor for a nutrition bar . It 's a must-buy !	1
I 've tried almost EVERY bar there is out there ! Learned the hard way not to JUST look at the protein to carb , to fat ratios ! Watch out for the myriad of bars with sucrolose & other `` BAD '' sweetners ! If you are n't up on them , do a google search & read the negative side effects instead of the advertising hype put out by the manufacturers ! The balance bars have NO SUCROLOSE or artificial sweetners ! ! YAY ! ! Even though I PREFER the protein to be from ANYTHING other than soy ... . which sadly these are ... ... ... I can not help but buy cases of these that I `` rotate '' with my 'healthier '' non-soy '' bars WHY ? ? You might ask ... ... ... ... it 's because they taste so GOOD ! I absolutely LOVE the latest line up of `` Bare Bars '' so do my kids , we take out 4 different bars EVERY morning & cut them up so everyone gets some of each flavor , YUMMM ! ! then somedays we can not help ourselves & have to open up 4 more ! ! LOL : - ) This is what we refer to as our 1st breakfast VERY eary in the morning when we all gather for a cup of tea or milk , & have family devotions , then after household chores are completed & our school day begins the kids have their second breakfast , I go off to do my workout , usually weights for 1/2 an hour to 45 minutes , then I get my second `` breakfast '' of a Bare bar , currently LOVING chocolate almond or a mix of pieces of Balance bars & others like the Cliff Builders bars ( the Vanilla Almond is my fav there ) or a thinkthin chunky Peanut , to keep my muscles refueled to rebuild & keep my metabolism boosted ! It works well for me , I am 50 years old 5'5 ' ( about ) & weigh 110 to 115 , & a size 4 ! There are other foods that can do the same thing , but they do n't satisfy a sweet craving like these babies do ! I just have to hide my fav 's from the kids ! !	1
I have tried many Balance Bar flavors , and Mocha Chip is one of my favorites . It has a great chocolatey taste which satisfies my sweet tooth while still being healthier than a chocolate bar . Keeps me full , too.Amazon shipped it quickly , and the item arrived fresh and undamaged .	1
This flavor is always sold out in the stores . I have a subscription delivery because of that . So ... I must be in very good company when I say that it is delicious . Goes good with milk ( skim , of course ) and I also like to drink a diet Coke Zero with it sometimes ( the combo is yummy ) . Highly recommend this bar if you like Cookie Dough flavored food .	1
These provide the very high potency I was looking for , are priced competitively and are easy to swallow in spite of their size . I 've bought them before and will continue to do so .	1
I can tell the difference immediately when I take this supplement . I have replaced my multivitamin with this only , since I am concerned about taking too much of the vitamins A and C. I have been reading that too much of those two vitamins can cause serious problems , worse that a defiency.This is my old standby and it has exactly the right amounts of each of the B vitamins , without overdoing any of them , which can cause , in the case of vitamin B6 , serious nerve damage . This has only 50mg of B6 which is just about right . Any more and you are taking too much of a risk.This always acts like a tonic for me . If I go without it for a few days I slow down and do n't feel right . Twinlab is one of my favorite supplements , and this one in particular is a mainstay of my supplement regimen .	1
I am shocked to find a perfectly well balanced stress complex . Fourty years ago this would be considered a normal b complex with extra b3 and b5 also the PABA and Biotin . I never have anything nice to say about any b complex , I always complain about them . Solgar is okay but you have to add the extra b3 and b5 and the others to make it complete . Read & # 34 ; Let 's Get Well & # 34 ; by Adele Davis written in the 60 's and you can see how horrible the b complex tabs or caps are today because they cause so many horrible health problems and you are better off not taking any . Out of balance b 's are dangerous . Read the book . this is a great b complex I just wish they would add another 50mcg . to the Biotin . It is the best I have seen in many , many years . Thanks , Twinlab , you are the best.You are a highly ethical company which is rare today with vitamin companies in my opinion . Anyone who knows anything about b complex knows how dangerous they are today and for the last 25 years .	1
We 've been using this product for years and are very happy with it . It 's particularly nice to learn that the stress-B complex is now available on Amazon 's subscription service at a small discount .	1
I found these after doing some research online . I have suffered from anxiety for years . Even though these May not relieve anxiety symptoms I love all the great vitamins in these . If you are looking for a good B vitamin supplement , get these !	1
this is the best energy boost I have found . makes the urine really yellow..ok ... ca n't live without them ... a great product .	1
I think it works - who can really tell if a vitamin really works ? could be placebo all over - or could be that it really works , I think it gives more energy during my workouts , but not even sure of that . I will keep taking it for now .	1
Insurance would n't cover hubby 's prescription for Metanx for chronic kidney disease . MD said to get a really high quality B-Complex and take it twice a day . I checked Twin Labs first since they have a reputation for excellent products . Have used them for years . This particular product met with the doc 's approval for what hubby needed AND it included 1 Gram of Vit C. I think it has helped him since his kidney function is almost back to normal and he is off several other meds .	1
I am going through perimenopause and one of the symptoms is joint stiffness and pain . If I do n't take these then I feel like I 'm a hundred years old when I wake up in the morning . When I do take them , then I 'm normal again . I know that I do n't get enough of the B vitamins in my diet so taking these really help me feel better and they also give you a good dose of vitamin C too . The bottle says to take 2 capsules a day , but I 'm good with just one . These are easier to swallow than most B complex pills . The old style ones just about make me choke , but I can tolerate these . You will notice that these pills will make your urine bright yellow because your body is n't able to absorb all of the vitamins.so if you decided to take two a day it 's better to space out the dosages rather than taking them at the same time , otherwise your body will expel the extra potency that it ca n't absorb into your urine .	1
I have seen a drastic drop in my stress level since I started taking this product and I am entrnally gratiful for the help .	1
I really like this B complex . I 've used it for many years . It 's very easy on the stomach if taken with food , which many B 's are not . I feel better when I use it . I 've found it best to keep it in the refrigerator though , as it tends to go & # 34 ; off & # 34 ; otherwise , before I 've finished the bottle .	1
For many vitamins , you can list off several benefits that you 'll receive from supplementing with them . But with B-Complex vitamins , the benefits gained outweigh the price you 'll pay , especially if you 're getting on here . Some of the health benefits are the boosting of your immune system , increases in your metabolism , increases in cell growth , and in my case , the the optimization of neural functions . I take nootropics and this vitamin has been repeatedly indicated as being the vitamin with the highest cost per benefit ratio when it comes to keeping the neurons in your noggin in top shape . Highly recommended . Good luck with your noggin functions .	1
Came promptly and well packaged . I like this brand . You sent me two bottles instead of the just one that I thought I ordered . But I gave the spare to my granddaughter and she is delighted !	1
I have neuropathy problems and must take additional B Vitamins to keep it under control . I had been taking tablets , but found that they often got caught in my throat and I would end up not taking that dose , and as a result I would have the pain and tingling in my legs that trouble me so much . But gagging down a large tablet did n't seem the answer either . These capsules are easy to swallow and I have noticed a marked improvement in my neuropathy problems , and an over all feeling of calmness . I would certainly recommend this product to anyone who should take more B Vitamins .	1
I like that I can take one pill and get all of the b vitamins in it . great for the body in many ways	1
These pills are very easy to swallow . I have no gripes with this product and have had no side effects when taking this B-vitamin supplement .	1
absorbable , does n't 'taste ' like a B vitamin ( some I get unfortunate burp ups ... ew ) helps with my mood . ok. ok .	1
Another good B complex capsule , this on with added vitamin c which is good , you need a good quantity of vitamin c every day	1
I have been taking B-complex vitamins for years but recently changed to these Twinlab vitamins . I definitely like the formulation of these better than any others I have taken , particularly because these include choline and inositol , both of which are helpful in stress/anxiety relief . The directions suggest taking two capsules a day . I tried this but unfortunately I just felt too jittery and uneasy after taking such a potent dose . Thankfully one capsule a day works great for me . They 're great to get me through that 2:30 slump at work and help me sleep better as well .	1
Good product ! I like these a lot .	1
You will see a big difference in your nervous system . Helps with incontinence , sleep , and energy levels . Good for pets , too .	1
I liked these and I noticed a slight edge on them . They seem to be the perfect amount for my frame .	1
I like that there 's no after taste with these as there is with some high strenghth B complex vitamins . I believe they really do help with stress as I 've been on them for a couple years and can really notice a difference ! Would recommend .	1
hubs and i have some health issues , I 'd say this stuff keeps us from going down the rabbit hole , especially now that germs are being imported here . anyway , thanks to taking this and washing off all the sticky crap from the shopping carts to buy things that you ca n't get off of Amazon ( ! ) , this has kept us cold/flu free for 3 years now ; - )	1
B complex vitamins are great for the body , and it has boost my energy level . I do n't know if I 'll buy the capsules again , because I now use the liquid vitamins , which goes down faster and smoother . But glad to have tried these .	1
I found this list , which shows the percentages for each vitamin in this product , on a different site and thought I would share it here . Sorry it does n't paste in table format . : PI only wish they would specify whether or not the B12 in this is the cyanocobalamin or the methylcobalamin version .

Good vitamin , does not have lots of junk added in for filler . Works great , but it turns your urine yellow .	1
Twinlab has a long track record , been around a long time and have n't found them to be a sham . Feel better when i take it .	1
I replaced my daily vitamin C with these and I think these are better than what I 'm taking before . I did not take the suggested dosage though , one pill per day ( preferably in the morning or afternoon ) is good enough for me .	1
Definitely a great B Complex capsule . Wish it was n't quite so large , sometimes hard to swallow . But we like it .	1
What I really wanted was vitamin E oil , but , unless you buy them in capsules , they are full of additives . So , this works .	1
It seems to be becoming harder and harder to find the mixed tocopherals in Vit E formulas . I looked in several local pharmacies and ended up ordering online . This Vit E seems to be exactly what I was looking for and the price was right . Wish it were covered by Prime as I had to wait for almost a week to receive it . Other than that , I have no complaints and am very grateful to have found a Vit E with a range of tocopherals in it .	1
Bought this item for my sister in the USA and she is pleased with it . I am going to buy the same for myself . I feel the E complex is adding variations of E to your health but any vitamin E is o.k . Thank you .	1
Do n't know how to rate this but suffice it to say that my blood tests come back great every six weeks . I have rheumatoid arthritis and have been taking these for nearly ten years and I 'm still alive ( thank G-d ) . I take toxic meds for the RA so have to take about ten different vitamins daily to help boost my compromised immune system .	1
Have been using this for a few years . Great source of real vitamin E. Price here is higher than at vitamin stores even with subscribe and save .	1
I 've always like TwinLab products . This one is no different . Convenient gel , easy to take and very effective . I highly recommend this Super E !	1
This was amazing shipping . And tis is one of the best vitamin E 's for the price , since it contains the gamma E as well , which is good for allergies .	1
This was a great product at a good price for mixed tocophorols . ( being that there are no immediate visible benefits , that is a subjective statement . ) The pills were easy to swallow	1
I really have started to like Twinlab products . They are in tinted bottles , which help prevent damage from light . The bottles are glass , which are sturdier and better for the products ( and I 've begun re-using them for other things because they are so high-quality and have good-sealing lids ) . The softgels inside are high-quality , not too much gelatin , easy to swallow , no odor.Sometimes , I 'll use a small pin to poke the softgel and will use the vitamin E gel inside directly ( it can help soothe the pain of a minor burn sometimes and is a good facial skin treatment before a shower ) . And the gel inside is sufficient in amount to use for these other purposes , and while it is a gel , it 's not super sticky . It spreads easily and absorbs into the skin well , which makes me think it probably absorbs well when ingested too.I will be buying these regularly from Twinlab , and I 've been so impress , I 'm buying other things of theirs as well , such as their NAC for liver toxicity issues and for people who take Tylenol regularly or drink frequently .	1
I 'm following the Vaso Guard therapy from `` What your doctor wo n't tell you About Hypertension '' . The author has a list of vitamins , etc to take and lists specific forms of the vitamins.The author ( also a doctor ) was very specific in the E coming from several types . This was the only brand I could find that actually included the information ! ! ! It 's very frustrating that many brands do n't include that info in either a picture of the back of the bottle , so you can see that , or at least in the description field.I 'm glad this one did !	1
I TAKE 3-4 OF THESE A DAY AND THEY SEEM TO WORK WELL . I 've had a lot of health problems over the last 20 yrs as I am now 70 yrs of age - have done a LOT of research on supplements and homeopathy so yes , I take vitamin E and am a firm believer in its ' uses ... this brand is good and capsules seem fresh.Recommended for those over 40 yrs of age ... check wi your dr. if necessary , but I did n't .	1
This is the best tweezer ever . My teenage daughter stole mine so I had to buy another one ! Truly I never had a tweezer this good , I first came across it at a blog called House Unseen Life Unscripted or something like that .	1
I never used to pluck my eyebrows but since I 've been trying the & # 34 ; do what the other girls do to look professional & # 34 ; thing last semester , I 've decided that it 's probably something I should do . I got a facial in October and the beautician gave me a free eyebrow wax . I had someone else do one when the unibrow came back and decided that I could just pluck my own 'brows.This is not the most accurate thing but if they literally had something that could only pick up one hair at a time all of you would go insane . It gets more than one at a time so you just have to plan a little better . They 're really very accurate when you 're paying attention and they do hold on to the hairs . If a beginner like me can figure it out , you seasoned pros should be able to , too .	1
i was tired of trying so many of those and relied on the reviews to order this one . it is AMAZING ! ! i totally recommend	1
I needed and an extre set of tweezers and these are great ! Fair cost and almost as good as my tweezer man brand ones . I 'd recommend !	1
I recommended this product to all my family members and friends , because I tried a few different brands ( Sally Hansen tweezers with new diamond cut sucks ! ) , and this one never failed me ! The gripping is perfect and it is small enough to satisfy any perfectionista .	1
What can you really say about it other than it works , A goods but and cheaper here than at the local stores ,	1
These are great tweezers at a great price ! I 'd definitely recommend these tweezers . They work really well and are well made .	1
My old tweezers were too clunky . They would often pluck more than one eyebrow hair . I like this tweezer because I can detail my eyebrows with it .	1
Like the top says ... Does the job , Carefull on the non name one , they do n't work like this one does..No I can pluck away	1
These little tweezer are ideal for those people hitting 40 something or older who are discovering hairs in places they never had them before . They pluck with aplomb and have a nice grip and tip.I gave it 4 stars simply because I could not bring myself to rater ANY tweezer 5 stars .	1
These are great tweezers . They are good lucking , stylish , inexpensive , precise and they hold onto hairs in you ingrown razor bumps much better than some pair of old tweezers , get them now ...	1
Who cares about the print ( yes , I got the blue/white design ) , the mechanics of this tweezer is amazing . It grabs onto the finest or thickest hair to be tweezed without losing it 's grip . Excellent .	1
I pluck errant hairs around my beard and mustache as well as from my nose . These tweezers are amazing . They grip strongly with a flat contact surface . I wo n't buy any other tweezers ever .	1
Lightweight tweezers , seem to work if I put on glasses to see those errant whiskers I so abhor . Used these to grab a splinter , too . Worked real well for that .	1
My old tweezers ended up breaking after several years . These are sharp enough to grab small hairs , but it 's not as stiff as my old pair of tweezers .	1
Slant tip with sharp edges is perfect for sliver removal . Good grip . Basically what you would expect in order this product .	1
I have only purchased two other tweezers and this one works best for me . It holds and works like it should	1
PROS1 ) I use these daily , and they have turned out to be very long lasting . Other tweezers will lose their grip after many times of usage.2 ) The thin tip in the tweezers gives you a better view while plucking your eyebrows , and it also gives you a more precise plucking experience that prevents you from plucking several hairs at a time.3 ) They have a nice professional look.CONSNone that I know of . Look at other reviews .	1
I bought two , one for me and one to send to my husband who is deployed . They came in this blue flower design , my husband said they are embarassing to use , I like them better than the black . He made me buy a new pair in a normal color . The product works great though , I rate it up there with tweezerman which are much more expensive , they do n't have the edge that tweezerman does but thats helpful for me because i do n't accidently pinch my skin or break off hairs instead of plucking them . So I love mine , him not so much .	1
REAL CHEAP LOVE THEM PERFECT $ $ $ A+A+ A+ A+ A+ A+ A+ A+ A+ A+ A+ A+ A+ A+ A+ A+ A+	1
If you own this style razor , it seems like the blades must be hand made and out of gold and platinum based on cost . ( Joking ) however the real issue is finding a local store that still has them . Well enough searching , this vendor has them , they are not expensive and they arrived ahead of schedule . So I will keep ordering from them until the supply is gone .	1
This is a great product that I use once a month to make sure my meter is still functioning properly . I would recommend this to be used by anyone with a OneTouch Meter . The last thing you want as a diabetic is bad results , so if you want to make sure your strips and meter are in good working function buy this .	1
This is a must have product . You should use this product every time that you open up a new contaiber of test stips to make sure that your glucose meter is still functioning properly .	1
When starting a ketogenic diet these are OK to see if youre making progress towards ketosis . After youre into though , these become kind of useless since the body can trigger purple when you could be out of keto.. if that makes sense	1
I use these when I am on the Atkins diet . It is a good way to make sure you have a low level of ketosis . I know they are n't that exact , but for my purposes they work very well.I do take into account whether the 'sample ' is very dilute or not , and in that case I will check later that day when I have drunk less .	1
I 've made the mistake of ordering off brands in the past and i 've gotten multiple boxes with 'dead ' strips -- either the expiration date had been altered/incorrect or there had been some kind of temperature or storage mishap . Not so with the Bayer product.One important thing about purchasing an item like this though is to note the actual seller . This item ( at the time of the review ) is sold by one of Amazon 's partner vendors . In fact , the one listed today is not the same as the one that mailed mine so do the due diligence on checking out the vendors . This also means that shipping charges may vary as can the actual product prices . The listing today is actually about 10 percent less than what I paid ( oh well ) . Sometimes you can even find vendors that keep their stock in the Amazon warehouse system and get the products with Prime/Super Saving as well ... but do pay attention as the vendor ( or at least the shipping ) can change between the time you add to your cart and the time you check out.In any case , for those seeking to know their ketone status , this is a nice product -- easy to use , easy to read , and reliable.Recommended ! JTG	1
These do a good job . Unlike some others that seem to expire quickly , these last a long time . I buy them regularlyl .	1
I bought these strips to help me on the induction phase of my low-carb diet . They are easy to use and it is , for the most part , easy to tell if I am in ketosis or not . If you 're not , it 's a pretty obvious negative . If you are , the strip turns pink ( for & # 34 ; trace & # 34 ; amount of ketones , which is the most you 'll ever get on a low-carb diet ) .I test my pee in the morning , and it 's fun to start the day off with an indication that I did well on my diet the day before ! I think that these strips wo n't be effective forever , because in & # 34 ; The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living , & # 34 ; the authors mention that after a few weeks of ketosis , the body begins to adapt. & # 34 ; Within a few days of starting on carbohydrate restriction , most people begin excreting ketones in their urine. & # 34 ; ... But over a matter of weeks , the muscles stop using these ketones for fuel . Instead , muscle cells take up acetoacetate , reduce it to betahydroxybutyrate , and return it back into the circulation . Thus after a few weeks , the predominant form in the circulation is beta-hydroxybutyrate , which also happens to be the ketone preferred by brain cells ( as an aside , the strips that test for ketones in the urine detect the presence of acetoacetate , not beta-hydroxybutyrate ) . & # 34 ; In the kidney , this process of keto-adaptation is also complex . Over time , urine ketone excretion drops off , perhaps to conserve a valuable energy substrate ( although urine ketone excretion never amounts to very many wasted calories ) . This decline in urine ketones happens over the same time-course that renal uric acid clearance returns to normal ( discussed below ) and thus may represent an adaptation in kidney organic acid metabolism in response to sustained carbohydrate restriction . These temporal changes in how the kidneys handle ketones make urine ketone testing a rather uncertain if not undependable way of monitoring dietary response/adherence . Testing serum for beta-hydroxybutyrate is much more accurate but requires drawing blood , and it is expensive because it is not a routine test that doctors normally order. & # 34 ; ( Phinney , Stephen ; Volek , Jeff ( 2011-07-08 ) . The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living : An Expert Guide to Making the Life-Saving Benefits of Carbohydrate Restriction Sustainable and Enjoyable ( pp . 164-165 ) . Beyond Obesity LLC . Kindle Edition . ) So actually , if after a few weeks the strips say you 're not in ketosis , it just may be a sign that your body has adapted to the low-carbohydrate diet , which is what you want.I 've only been using them for about a week , so we 'll see what happens in a few weeks . But for now , waking up and peeing on the strip and seeing it turn pink is very encouraging !	1
These Ketostix arrived quickly from the supplier . I need then or my low carb diet and am so pleased with what was sent . They are not expired , worked exceptionally well , and have helped m feel good about staying in a fat-burning mode . Bayer makes these strips and it , too , is a name I trust . Iw ill definitely order again from this seller as I ams o pleased with the entire manner in which they conducted their sale and shipment .	1
I used these when I first started doing Atkins & they are tremendously helpful in keeping track of progress & seeing the sticks turn color absolutely increases motivation to stick with it when the going is tough ( breaking free of sugar cravings was hard at first ) .These are inexpensive & very useful ( if not a little bit habit-forming ) . : )	1
There may be better lancets , but these are effective and painless . The price is reasonable too . I plan to continue buying	1
Bought because , like many others , I have to test my blood every morning . Adult onset diabetes is n't any fun but these little stabbers do a good job without too much fuss .	1
This product works fine . Just needs a better delivery system . If you need a better description of what I mean . See my review of the Lancet Device .	1
I have been using these lancets for many years and they work very well . I admit that I have n't compared them to other lancets on the market , but I have n't felt the need to do any comparison shopping since the lancets work for me .	1
my son uses these and he likes them . Usually cheaper on line than in the store . they work as expected	1
I 've been a type 1 diabetic for 18 years . I test my blood sugar an average of 7 times per day . I 've tried almost every lancet testing device on the market and the SoftClix is definitely the least painful.These are about half the price of what my local drugstore charges.By the way , for any new diabetics out there who do n't know , you can test on you knees . No pain at all . At least a dozen times over the years , I 've checked my knee and then immediately checked again on my finger and the results have been within 5 points of each other . Close enough for me . I use a Bayer Contour meter . You need just enough blood to make the meter beep and the test strip fill up to where it 's supposed to , but be careful ... .too MUCH blood can throw off the reading just as well as too LITTLE blood . At least that 's what I was told by a Bayer technician over the phone.I know you 're supposed to change the lancet every time you test , but for all these years , I 've used the same lancet for about 3 or 4 tests , so I use two a day . Never had a problem .	1
I use these with the Accu-Chek Softclix lancet device . If you do not have Softclix lancing pen to use with these , I recommend getting one . Drawing a sample is often pain-free , and always less painful than the TruTest lancet pen and lancets I used before . I am happy with how easy this is to use , the push button eject boost helps remove used lancets without accidental stabs . I am surprised at how much better the Softclix is than the other lancing pen I tried ( I 'm a new home blood tester ) .The Softclix also loads and `` fires '' better . The button that releases the spring and point for the `` stab '' seems more firm and fast . The Soctclix device seems better made , less shaky , tighter tolerances . Another reviewer wrote that the Softclix is less painful because it has fewer/dampens vibrations when the needle goes in , and that seems true in the `` feel '' of the Softclix lancing pen . A smaller puncture with these tips also seems to bleed better for some reason , allowing me to draw enough blood with a 2.5 gauge ( depth ) puncture , where I needed a deeper puncture ( 5 depth on the gauge ) with the TruTest lancing pen .	1
I 've been a type I diabetic for 51 years , so I 've had lots of experience with lancing devises and lancets . These are , by far , the BEST lancets I 've ever used . I can barely feel a prick and , for me , they draw more than enough blood on a low setting . Definitely recommended .	1
Great price on Amazon . I really like the Accu-Chek brand.They work perfectly with my Accu-Chek system . I recommend them to anyone that needs Lancets if you have an Accu-Chek meter .	1
I 've spent years cringing even at the though of using lancets to draw blood for my glucose meter . Sometimes in the past I was so fearful of the pain ( small that it has been really ) that I avoided testing as frequently as I knew I should -- and then being so mad at myself for my cowardice ! Then I switched to an Accu-Chek meter and started using these lancets . At first I did my normal cowardly cringing but was absolutely astounded by the minimal pain of the pricks . I am sold . I draw blood reliably with an intermediate puncture setting . The device is easy to use . I know that I will manage my diabetes much better now that I am not so intimidated by finger pricking .	1
By buying through Amazon I saved over 60 % . This is a reorder of an original order placed in November 2009.Thanks	1
I was amazed to find these most reliable pads at Amazon . I had already used this product and found it BEST ! And , best of all for me , now without transportation , by buying 2 I qualified for free shipping !	1
Good size and good absorbancy as described . Well priced and easy to use . Prefer to Poise and other comparable pads . Non-chaffing .	1
This product works and works well . It catches the spills and it 's a great price too . Not much else to say except that if you have health insurance this product is FSA/HSA eligible and as such your insurance will pay for it so buy it at drugstore.com and you 'll be able to charge it to your FSA/HSA account .	1
Hmmmmm , what can I say ? I have bought so many of these that I should be part owner in the company . Guess that means I like this product .	1
large package of pads , 56 count . A little thick , but useable . COuld be a little thinner and have wings attached .	1
I purchase this product because I 'm 63 and do n't want to have any accidents . It is nice that no one knows I buy them and use them . The price is great and I will continue to order them .	1
If they did the job 100 % , I 'd rate them higher , but I have had a couple of leaks . I do have to say they 're the best I 've found so far , but I 'm still looking . I wo n't get the long ones , if I end up getting them again .	1
Got these because I recently came down with the cough that would n't go away . Using these saved a lot of washing whenever I coughed , which was often.My only complaint , and it is n't a deal breaker , is they are wrapped compactly so that the ends tend to curl up instead of adhering to the underwear .	1
I purchase these pads for my mother and she loves them ! She wanted a long pad which is not bulky but does the job and these pads do the job for her ! They are comfortable to wear yet provide the added protection she needs . You will be glad you got these ! Great protection at a reasonable price thanks to Amazon !	1
I have no complaints about this product . It was everything I was looking for in a pad . They stay put and hold more than I had expected . A good buy .	1
overall pretty good , not what I was looking for , but what you see is what you get . cant complain . = )	1
They are apparently much less bulky and uncomfortable to sit on than thePoise Bladder Protection Pads , Max Long , Case of Four-42 Count ( 168 Pads ) that she used to get , and less expensive . Thanks , Amazon .	1
These pads , which , as I age , I 'm finding useful are indeed very discreet and also eliminate odors . I have COPD , which means a lot of coughing and sneezing , and the consequences of age ( 80 ! ) plus these - well , anyone interested will know what I mean ! They come in different lengths and thicknesses , so there 's a lot of choices to allow you to decide just which ones you 'll need . This brand was my first choice , and I 've been very satisfied , so have n't tried other brands . I do recommend these .	1
I ordered these for a friend of mine because of the price and she could not find them at this price .	1
I know this is not the intended purpose , but I used these overnight for my incontinent large dog ( inserted into a pair of tinkle trousers ) . He could have a full bladder empty and 6-8 hours later all was contained with no leakage . They will , of course , get very heavy when saturated , but the surface seemed to stay fairly dry .	1
No one wants to have to use these things , plain and simple . I am a 35 yr old mom of a 13 yr old and 4 yr old . I never thought that i would need something like this at such a young age . I have MS and can no longer walk very well . I use a motorized chair all day long but at night I walk/stumble from my bed to my master bathroom . It 's faster than unplugging the charger for the chair and turning it around and trying to get it into the bathroom quietly . During the day I can use lighter pads because I do n't have to be so quiet but at night I HAVE to use these pads . I have n't been able to find anything else that works as well as these do , they do n't leak for me . I have numbness in private areas so sometimes I ca n't feel when I need to go , sometimes I fall and that causes accidents , too . Due to the treatment I 'm on I get frequent UTI 's and those can cause accidents when I 'm sleeping . With these I do n't have to wake up my husband so the sheets can be changed.I can find these at the Meijer for a better price usually but due to the numbness ( in my right foot , too ) I can no longer drive . My husband does n't exactly enjoy buying these at the store so if I do n't go to the store with him it 's just easier to order them here . I wish the price were more competetive here but sometimes convenience just outweighs a couple of dollars .	1
After prostate surgery a man needs to know which pee pad to use . I went through a process of trying a few kinds , and am now settled on this one . I wear knit boxer shorts and attach the top end of a pad to the stretch band of the shorts and tuck the rest of the pad down to the crotch of the shorts . Not exactly the best feeling in the world , but beats having a wet spot on the shorts . The pad stays put , and if there 's ever a big leak I just replace the pad . What 's to say : prostate surgery is a bitch .	1
I like that I do n't have to drag them home from the store- both for the 'nobody 's business ' factor and also because of having a lot of pain with unloading stuff when I do my monthly shopping .	1
I use these inside a belly band that I bought for my boy dog who seems to not be able to hold it long enough to run to the door now that he 's an old man . Pretty absorbent and between the belly band and these , I would say it catches 90 % of his accidents . I think I might try to find these with & # 34 ; wings & # 34 ; next time so they stay in place a little better . I think that will help .	1
Of all the pads on the market that I 've tried , and I have tried a number of them , I like these the best . I used to wear Poise pads and one day on a whim I read the reviews of the Tena serenity products . That review read like it was my own story so , it made sense for me to try the product . I have never looked back since then . In my opinion , these pads hold more liquid and are more comfortable than any of the similar products on the market . I did n't give them five stars just because I do n't feel any of the pads on the market are perfect.. But , I do recommend them !	1
These pads are great ! They open easily , they fit well , and they do the job . I had switched from another brand that was just not doing the job .	1
I use these pads for male dogs who are not housebroken with a belly band . these are the best pads at wicking away the moisture and keeping their skin dry and in good condition	1
I bought this to put in a belly band for my pugs ( one is incontinent , the other marks ) . So far , these pads have done a great job of being absorbent and staying put .	1
I now use these and they are safe for multiple times of small amount of & # 34 ; flow & # 34 ; during the daytime , but not for overnight . They are great in that kind of situation . These will be a staple purchase for me and I like this brand . I have tried other brands but I find this is the most comfortable and works the best for me during the daytime .	1
My local store was consistently out of these pads . I would have to ride a bus to get this necessary item only to find the store was out . I was pleased to find these pads offered on Amazon at a cheaper price than my local big box store . Another plus is that they are discretely delivered to my home . Also , no more carrying a large bag of pads , on the bus . Thank you Amazon !	1
We used them daily , excellent product and its doing a wonderful job . Soft and it does protect you fromincontinence problems .	1
The item was as described and arrived on time without any problems ! I would definitely recommend this product and this seller ! My grandmother uses these , but , we normally spend much more for half this amount . I was ecstatic when I saw this brand name and quantity for such a great price ! ! We are definitely buying from here , from now on !	1
Great overnight . I put these in the bottom of Depends to aid in the overnight protection . Although ; if they get too overloaded , the stuffing will come out of the center . Still the best I 've tried - an I 've tried a few different brands .	1
I have severe problems in this respect and this is the ONLY product that works . You will not be disappointed .	1
I wear these at home all day and when I have to get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom , so I do n't dribble on the floor . I use the smaller version at night . I may go through three during the day .	1
We use these for our incontinent son , who has CP . Comfortable , absorbent , easy to use . Good price . Definitely purchase again .	1
These pads are the best ! They not only work excellent but are also comfortable to wear and easy to use .	1
I tried every brand for my mom who has severe incontinence . These worked better that anything on the market . I would highly recommend these for anyone caring for a loved one with incontinence . I usually use more than one just by placing them in the back of the underwear also to protect urine from leaking upwards when they are lying down . The other brands I tried leaked and did n't have good coverage . Tena Overnights are great for overnight and DAY time . I highly recommended by me ! ! ! !	1
I have tried so many brands and sizes . I talked with the tena representative and she suggested the anytime size . Works for me .	1
They were very good for my grandmother who used other forms to treat her inbalance . she said they work better than the others she used .	1
I purchase these pads through the monthly subscription plan which means I get a set amount of packages sent to my home each month . The shipping is free , the subscription price is cheaper than Wal Mart and the pads are super absorbant . I am very satisfied with ordering this product through Amazon 's monthly subscription plan .	1
Bought these for a family member , and she finds them not too bulky and very comfortable to use ; she has just a little stress incontinence , she `` dribbles '' a little bit on her way to the toilet , and even though it 's only a few drops , it can be very embarrassing and upsetting . The tena pads are capable of holding much more , and the surface stays completely dry , so each pad can be re-used all day long with no odor or wetness resulting . She changes them twice a day , which saves on cost . Also we have auto delivery which is also much less expensive than the local supermarket , you do n't have to be seen buying them , and there 's always a good supply on hand . Even without using available coupons , it 's cheaper this way , although I wish I could use the coupons here . This product , and getting them through Amazon , has been a true dignity-saver ! !	1
It 's my go to pad and gives me the confidence to be about without worries . Since my OA is mostly at night I usuallydo n't require more than one pad for the entire day . It is also very comfortable and un-noticeable .	1
These pads really work to keep me dry . I tried so many other brands but always ended up disappointed . I like how they are individually packaged so I can carry them in my purse . Bladder incontinence is no joke although comedians seem to think so and anything that can make me feel like less isolated and able to get out and about without worries of an & # 34 ; accident & # 34 ; is nothing to laugh about . Tena Serenity Pads really do that for me .	1
Kept my elderly family member in these for 2 years . Never found anything better . They were absorbent , & stayed where they were put !	1
I love these pads and used to get them on a subscribe and save . I was so disappointed when Amazon could n't offer them through this service anymore . They are very absorbent and comfortable to wear .	1
This has been my product of choice for several years now , for all the reasons stated by other reviewers.The new Tena Serenity pads are reshaped , and I found it difficult to avoid leakage , until I reversed the pad . Now , for me , the square end goes on the navel side . I still prefer the old Tena ultimate pads , and will get them more cheaply at my nearby non-chain drugstore.On March 5 , 2014 , I ordered them from Amazon for the price of $ 11.48 , with free two-day shipping from Amazon Prime.By March 25 , 2014 , the Amazon price is 24.94 , from an Amazon subsidiary , Quality Health Care Products . They offer three to five day shipping from Kentucky . Since I am living only on Social Security Disability , the overall monthly cost has more than doubled overnight.SHOCK , maybe . There is a new policy for & # 34 ; Select items that are large , heavy , or require special handling. & # 34 ; There is no option to order the product from Amazon 's extensive network of warehouses . This offloading of an item that is bulky to pack and ship , to a healthcare subsidiary , makes sense from the AMazon point of view , but not from the individual user with disabilities who relies on Amazon . Such a person with disabilities ( PWD ) can not make a separate trip to pick up one , two , or four packs of Tena pads , at a local store that charges a great deal more than Amazon 's old price of $ 11.24 ( with free two-day shipping with Prime ) .The new Tena Serenity pads are reshaped , and I found it difficult to avoid leakage , until I reversed the pad . Now , for me , the square end goes on the navel side . I still prefer the old Tena ultimate pads , and will get them more cheaply at my nearby non-chain drugstore .	1
Alas , I must admit that I leak now and then . I tried using panty liners , but they just were n't quite right for the job . I finally broke down and tried these . I 'm in love ! They 're comfortable , discreet , well made , and control odor . Wonderful product .	1
I do n't have leaks and it protects even at night . It is much softer and more absorbant than Poise . I have been using this brand for three years and I like it best of all the popular products on the market and it is cheaper on Amazon.com than in the drug stores of marketthelmabelle @ aol.com	1
This product is by far the best one I have tried so far . I am still surprised at how much fluid it can hold .	1
Saved time & money by ordering on line . No more trips , just to find out the store was out of stock.7	1
This is n't as large as I 'd hoped it would be but it holds all I need it to hold each week for my dog 's medications .	1
Bought this for my daughter for a place to keep her pills . She is taking 5 vitamins and some are big and they fit in the slots with plenty of room left . The doors on the slots stay closed nice and tight .	1
I loved this product it took the guess work out of the other types of ovulation kits . I used this with the clearblue easy fertility monitor and I got pregnant the first month using it and had a baby in 2010 . I pulled this kit back out in 2011 and 2012 and got pregnant each time the first month trying but lost both to miscarriage .	1
These sticks are smaller then the ones that come in the box of seven . It took some time before I realized how switch the cap and insert it into the machine . If your not a morning person like myself , beware . I was almost late for work the first day I tried to use it because I was half asleep and did n't understand the diagram . THIS IS NOT THE FAULT OF THE PRODUCT ! It works great once you figure it out .	1
The sticks worked fine . The price was better than I could get at the local stores so I am happy with my purchase .	1
These work fantastic just the like the monitor for the sticks . I got my peak on my first true cycle of using it ! YAY ! I will definitely be purchasing more in the future , but hopefully not for long . We 've waited nearly 12 months now for a baby , and nothing . We still have hope ! = ] We hope it happens sooner than later !	1
About me : I 'm just under 38 and trying to get pregnant for the first time . I 'd been put on the pill because I had an irregular cycle and terrible cramps and had been on it for almost 19 years before I went off this last May . I had gone off the pill a few years ago to see if my cycle was better but it went back to its irregular path.Why I choose this product : I 'm older and I hoped to not have to try for years . Also , because I have an irregular cycle , I could n't even begin to guess when I 'd ovulate so I figured this would help me take the guess work out . I also did n't want to examine my CM every day to guess . My friend used this and it helped her pinpoint her days and she highly recommended it.How 's it going : I 'm glad I 'm using it . It does tell me when I 'm ovulating and that 's what I wanted . It 's straightforward and easy to use . My ovulation varies so this is great for knowing when to tell my husband it 's game on . I 'm not pregnant yet , but think this is a great tool for simplifying the process . I could n't imagine how women did it before . I did decide to also do basal temperature to compare and find I 'm more confident with this monitor . I am a light sleeper and my husband wakes 2 hours before me . I found that my temperatures can vary greatly.Downside : You have to pee on a stick for 10 days at a time . I can understand the first few times as it `` learning '' your cycle but do n't understand why I have to continue once I 've ovulated in a cycle . And if it does n't detect an ovulation , you have to pee on a stick for 20 days ( which I did a couple of months ago ) . I will say peeing on sticks has lost it 's `` fun '' factor .	1
have been going to infertility , i could not find the days , and i was miscarring , so i bought the monitor and these test strips let me know , i am pregnant ever since i bought this product , thank you , fast service	1
worked well for understanding cycle and fertility . easy to use . I conceived after a few months and will use again next time .	1
If you have a long cycle , expect to use 20 sticks that first month since the machine starts you testing on day six and if you have not peaked by day fifteen it will ask you to test clear past your peak day and all the way to day twenty-five . Lesson learned after I had to buy another box of sticks to finish out month two when it started me testing on day eight . I think next month I will just time it so I only have to use half a box per cycle ( 15 sticks ) . Just start testing a few days later than the machine tells me to and stop testing after peak day will certainly cut down on stick usage and cost.Cons -- After you have spent morning after morning looking at the lines on the stick and seeing which one ( s ) show , it is easy to predict what the machine is going to say . I sort of feel ripped off by having to use the machine to tell me what I can plainly see with my own eyes . But the machine makes it easy to keep track of cycle days and it is an easy reminder to test , so I am not overly upset.I also find it easier and more accurate to use the `` dip in a cup '' method over the `` running stream '' method . Just use a disposable Dixie cup - much less messy and splashy.I am not sorry I bought the system -- I just need to tweak it a bit so that the sticks actually last me for three months . Gave it four stars because it DOES what it is supposed to do , took away one star because it gets expensive to use as directed if you have any issues at all with your cycle.My suggestion is to not rely too heavily on this machine and take the time to learn your body signs since sometimes signs come later in the day , even when you have had a low fertility reading in the morning . This is only an additional tool in natural family planning .	1
I got pregnant after using one pack . It 's so amazing . So I bought another pack for my old sister , I hope she can get pregnant soon .	1
works for me ...	1
I ca n't begin to tell you how good this stuff works . I was browsing Amazon and came across this product . It 's the same one I purchased at the drug store . I 've been using this stuff for about 4 years now , and it does n't even take a day to see the results . When using it regularly , you wo n't even see any bumps . I used it on my face for a while and have n't had any bumps since . I stopped for a while using it on the back of my neck , and although the bumps were n't as bad as they were in the past , I went back to using it . Same results . Bumps go down and in a few days , away.The dermatologist gave me a cream some 11 years ago and it worked so well . But this stuff works even better . Great product .	1
yes it is true , this thing works over night , I put it on as soon as I got it and while I was not that sure it will work , to my amaze , this thing sure did work , I get these bumps on the back of my head , I guess must be a bacteria from sweating a lot , because I do not shave , so this cream specify is for shaving bumps , but hey what do you know ? this treatment did work on me , just after 3 days my head is clear.. the only bad thing about it , the size , too small , but well worth ! ! !	1
I found this over 20 yrs ago and thru the processes of trying other products I always come back to the best for me . I presently use a Alum Blok & Clubman Gel directly aftershaving with Bump Fighter Razor then finish up with Bump Stopper for the problem areas . Although Clubman states it can be used on entire face or spot treatment . It just seems in my case Bump Stopper works best ( twice a day ) I 'll continue using these products together .	1
So , I would get itchy bumps if I did n't shave every two days , ever since I started shaving a few years ago . I 'm 35 , mind you , but always used clippers . Anyway , I 've been locked into shaving because of these ingrown hairs . I tried so many different things , including Tend Skin , which is as high as a giraffe 's behind . And really , it 's only glorified alcohol . But this stuff worked , and I mean IMMEDIATELY ! The last time I shaved was Thursday of last week . I used this for the first time that day after I shaved . It 's now Friday morning of the following week . The bumps and itching would have been unbearable with my regular shaving by Sunday at the absolute latest . Tend Skin would have bought me an additional day . But I have n't gone this lone ( over a week now ) without a shave since I started shaving , and I 'm not itching , and there are no bumps ! ! ! And I do n't even use the stuff as directed all the time . You 're supposed to use 2 applications a day . I only use 2 about half the time , when I think about it at night . The other days , it 's just one at the start of the day . Still , I have no complaints at all ! And considering that this stuff is so inexpensive , next to that high , rubbing alcohol knockoff called Tend Skin.My plan is to switch back to using clippers . Bump Stopper has made that possible !	1
I did n't realize at first that you do n't set the time window with any clock inside the machine yourself . It does this itself when you set it for the first time . So make sure to set it at the most convenient time as possible for you . If you set it to start on the first day at 9am , you have from 6am to 12pm to test . It asks for your first sample on day 6 so make sure and buy the test sticks too . Its that simple . Anytime before that window or after it , and the machine will not ask for a sample.My ovulation is irregular and comes late so I start my first day about five days after the last day of my period . It will all work out the same .	1
I am currently on my 7th consecutive month of using this monitor and still not pregnant . It appears that my cycles are normal and the monitor is doing its `` job '' by notifying me of my high and peak fertile days every month , but still no results . I realize that many women have instant success and attain pregnancy within the first month or two of using this monitor , but do n't get your hopes up too high . We 're still trying ...	1
Accurate and easy to understand . It 's well worth it if you need the extra guidance . Takes the guesswork out and adds proven science .	1
First month using the monitor it gave me 5 days of high and 2 peak days . However , the second peak day and following high day are automatically programmed - not based on what your test sticks say , so I 'm not sure why it requires you to waste your test sticks on these days . Also from talking to friends and doing more research online , despite the monitor saying it can be used for women with longer cycles , it seems harder for the monitor to identify peaks for them.Personally , I wished that I just stuck with the Clearblue digital ovulation tests - gave me the same info for a lot less money ( you can tell when you are getting close to ovulation as your LH line will get darker each day until positive ) . Maybe I should have done more research on the monitor beforehand , just not sure yet the cost of the monitor is worth it . I guess if you have a hard time temping and figuring out when your are ovulating , maybe it will be worth it to you .	1
It definately will let you know when you are ovulating . It is kind of a pain to use though unless you do n't mind peeing on a stick every day of the month at the same time unless you have your menses .	1
Me and my Hubby has been trying to Conceive for a Few Year 's , I 'm 37 and not getting any younger , so we Decided that we might just not be hitting my ovulation day 's like I believed I was . Well after buying the monitor I did find out I was calculating completely wrong . The monitor is very easy to use . And within a few minute 's , it will tell you if your not ovulating , or you hit the high peek to conceive..Just as simple as that ... Takes the Guessing in a whole better direction . I would highly recommend this monitor , and you only use about 10 strips thru the month . Hopefully my next review will be that it worked ! ! ! !	1
I was on pill for almost 1 1/2 years and came off it . My doctor said you can start trying for a baby immediately , no need to wait . She said it takes on average 6 months for a couple to get pregnant.So I get off the pill , we start trying and 2 months pass , nothing happens . I have always had rather long irregular periods , since adolescence . After I got off the pill , my first period was 45 days long and the next 35 days . I started reading online and found that the best time to conceive was when one ovulates . Many websites said that you ovulate in the middle of you cycle and that was assuming you were on a `` regular '' cycle i.e of 28 days.Since I knew I have long irregular cycles , I just thought why not give this ovulation prediction kit a try and see . I did n't want to spend another 4 months guessing how long my cycle was or waiting for the cycle to become regular.I used it the first time and we were pregnant : ) Wow ... so happy ! I ovulated on day 19th of my cycle . We used pre-seed lubricant ( you can read my review there ) .For me this product was worth every cents . I would definitely ask everyone to give this a try . It takes a little while to get used to it , so the manual is your best friend here . I use to take the test in the slot of 6- 9 am . So the first time I took this test , I took it at 7.30 am . This has to be the first urine.Also this monitor does not get shipped with the test sticks . You will have to buy them separately . If you have regular cycles , 10 sticks per cycle will work for you . However for me , it took 20 sticks for the cycle . So depending on your situation , you will need to stock up on the test sticks.All the best !	1
My DH and I are both in our late 30s and I just became pregnant for the first time , with some help from this fertility monitor . After all I 'd heard about pregnancy taking a long time especially with older mothers , I was anxious to get a head start after getting married recently . I had been on birth control pills since my 20s and came off them after our wedding a few months ago . At that time , my husband and I decided to wait a few months before trying to conceive , to clear any medications , vaccinations , and `` cosmeceuticals '' ( Rx retin-A face cream , Latisse , etc ) out of my system . But at that time I started taking prenatal multi , DHA , and calcium . Then last month we decided to start trying to conceive , with the help of this CBE fertility monitor.This monitor is easy to use . Just insert 4 AAA batteries ( not incl ) . Turn it on . Press the `` m '' button until you get to the current day of your cycle ( you can set it on any of days 1-5 ) . Whatever time of day you set the `` m '' button , that will be the middle of your 6 hour test window . So each day , you can turn on the monitor and test any time during the 3 hours before and the 3 hours after that time . I set mine at 7am so I could test from 4-10am . If you plan to travel across alot of time zones so that your test window is no longer in the morning , you can still use it within that same window ( so in my case , that would be whatever local time is at 4-10am in my home time zone ) . Just hold your urine for at least 4 hours before testing , to simulate it being your first morning urine ( hormones have more time to build up that way ) .Then every morning , turn on the monitor before you use the bathroom . For a few days it wo n't tell you to do anything , and it just tells you what day it is ( 1 , 2 , 3 , etc ) and shows a `` low '' reading , so then you turn it off . On the days when you turn it on and it shows a flashing test stick symbol , you take a test each such day , using your first morning urine . You can hold the test stick in your urine stream or dip it into a cup of urine . You can collect urine in a cup if you can not test right away , you can store the urine and test later . Then insert the test stick into the monitor in the direction shown in the instructions , until it clicks . Wait a few minutes and come back and check it . If you wait too long and the monitor turns off ( I would forget about it while eating breakfast ) , no problem , just turn it back on and the test result will be waiting for you . It will take about 20 test days in the first cycle to learn your cycle . After that it should ask you for about 10 or so tests per cycle . It is supposed to give you a few days of `` high '' , 2 days of `` peak '' and 1 day of `` high '' readings , in that exact order ( H , H , H , P , P , H ) . Ovulation itself should be on the last peak day or on the last high day . The monitor may not give peak days in some cycles but it does n't mean ovulation did n't occur . So in any case you should BD on some of the high days , not just peak.You must buy the packages of 30 test sticks separately , so if you order this monitor , you also need to buy a package of 30 test sticks and also separately get 4 AAA batteries . Store the monitor and test sticks on your dresser in the bedroom , or anyplace outside the bathroom since the humidity of the bathroom can damage it . It 's about the size of a bigger point-n-shoot digital camera or a handheld GPS . I kept it on a small tray ( better for my sleepy self to not drop it ) and carried it and a test stick into the bathroom each morning when I woke up.I used this monitor with my cycle that first month , starting on the first full day of my cycle as day 1 for the monitor . It had me testing about 20 times that cycle . The reading was `` low '' up through day 12 of my cycle . Day 13-15 were all `` high '' readings , and day 16-17 were both `` peak '' with the egg symbol , and day 18 was `` high '' . After that it went back to `` low '' the remaining days . This is consistent with the intended results . DH and I `` Baby Danced '' on days 13 , 16 and 17 . On the morning of day 18 , I had ovulation spotting so I know the fertility monitor was accurate . Here I am now , as shocked as anyone to be a few weeks into my first pregnancy on our first try , as my new husband and I are approaching 40 . We are both basically healthy , reasonably active , non-smokers who eat a mix of junk food and healthy food . So it was not cheap , but to me worth the cost to have more certainty of when to time things , especially since I 'm not the kind of person who will do the basal temperature method , and my schedule and business trips to distant countries ( and jet lag in each direction ) make my cycles too erratic sometimes to predict with much precision with a calendar method . And the cervical mucus method seems too subjective for my preference.In conjunction with using this monitor , I also read the first few chapters of the `` Making Babies '' 3 month program for maximum fertility . There were some really useful tips in the beginning few chapters that could apply to anyone seeking to become pregnant , and the timing of the whole conception process and when to BD corresponds directly to the CBE fertility monitor . The rest of that book could be interesting if you were struggling with fertility issues . I took some of the suggestions about nutrition , lifestyle , etc though and this probably helped too.BTW , in case you 're wondering if you can buy a used CBE monitor , the instructions say not to do so because the monitor learns your cycle and becomes tailored to you . However , the instructions also say that if you let the batteries die or take them out , the monitor will lose all stored info and will have to learn your cycle from scratch again . Take that as you will.Good luck to all !	1
Monitor is easy to use , very sensitive and accurate . Very helpful to use for fertility help . We were able to find out all the info we needed to get our plan set with the doctors .	1
I almost NEVER leave reviews ... I said to myself that if this worked for me..I would let others know since you are spending quite a bit of money for this monitor . First a little background..I always appreciated the reviews of women who gave a little background . I am 39 with 2 girls ages 6 and 9 . We decided a year ago to start trying for our last . I had no problems conceiving my first 2..But I think with my age being 39 it was a little harder this time . I have VERY long cycles and this monitor did the trick . It pinpointed my exact days of ovulation . I also followed this monitor up with regular ovulation sticks from clear blue easy . The regular sticks gave me a smiley face and this monitor gave me 2 peaks ( egg symbols ) and 5 high peaks ... The result is ... I AM PREGNANT ! ! ! After 12 months of trying I got pregnant with this monitor after only the first month of use ... It WORKS ! Just make sure to read all the directions prior to use..and also you can only start the monitor on days 1-5 of your cycle ... So if you order this after your period you will have to wait until the next month ... I know its pricey..But it was worth every bit of what I paid for it..It did in 1 month what I could n't do in 12 months ... Good Luck to all of you trying ! !	1
I have one that I used before and got pregnant with my daughter the very first time we used it . I stored the first one in the bathroom and that is a HUGE no , no . The moisture gets to it and ruins it . The shippers sent me extras that I was not expecting but it was a very nice surprise ! Thank you so much ! !	1
After trying for years to get pregnant ( using disposable Fertility tabs , timing methods , thermometers , etc . ) we decided to see a fertility doctor . After failing at two IUI 's and an IVF , we bought this monitor while waiting to do another IVF cycle . After the third month , my wife became pregnant ! This product is easy to use and apparently more accurate than the disposable types . It is also cheaper than IUI 's and IVF . Although this monitor may not help every couple get pregnant , I highly recommend trying this product for a few months before seeking more expensive treatments .	1
I 'm 36 and my husband is 38 . We did n't want to waste any time trying to have a baby so I bought this monitor . We started using it in September and last week ( end of November ) , I found out I 'm pregnant ! So it took us 3 cycles . The first month I had about 10 high days and finally got a peak on day 19 and 20 . My cycle is only 30 days long so that made me nervous ! It just seemed late . But the second month , I had 2 high days and then it peaked on day 16 and 17 . The third month , it went straight from low to peak . It peaked on day 17 and 18 . I thought it was odd that I did n't get any high days but that was the month I got pregnant . We had sx day 17 , 18 and 19 . We did not do it in the few days leading up to that peak because it was still on low.Being really type A , the third month I also had purchased cheap ovulation test strips from CVS - the store brand . And they coincided with the monitor perfectly . The only odd thing is that the test strips remained positive for four days . Whereas the monitor goes on autopilot after it hits your peak . So you only get two peak days no matter what with the monitor . I 'm not sure why the test strips gave me four days of positives but I just thought it was interesting . I am happy to know that the monitor and the test strips peaked at the same time.A few recommendations -- - if you have time -i.e . you are young and are just starting to try , you really do n't need to buy this monitor right away . For all I know , I might have gotten pregnant anyway without it . And given the store brand ovulation test strips peaked at the same time , you could just try those for a few months . I should also add that I used pre-seed all three months and sat with my legs propped up for a half hour after every time we tried . ( Yes , I looked ridiculous ... haha but I figured I should do everything I can to make it happen ) I know that 's a lot of information ! But I really enjoyed reading the reviews on here so I figured someone might want to hear my story . Assuming everything goes well with this pregnancy , we plan to use the monitor for baby # 2 as well.Update : I 'm now 18 weeks pregnant and since originally writing this review , the doctor confirmed ( based on the size of the baby/etc . ) that I did conceive at the time the monitor peaked . Given we had had sx other days of the month , I did n't know for sure that the monitor did the trick . But clearly it did !	1
I gave this product a 5 because I really think Tom 's products all deserve this rasting . I was upset to learn that this deodorant was not made anymore , but I knew I would find it here , on Amazon . The scent is light and the deodorant itself is not sticky or messy . I will continue to look for Tom 's products on Amazon .	1
I 've been using it for years . It costs a little more but there is no staining , no harsh chemicals , and it works fantastic .	1
I seem to have tried just about everything out there . I would rate the Astroglide product as one of my favorites and one I keep coming back to . My wife is over 50 now and while she still enjoys sex , but we do sometimes have a lubrication issue . The problem with the other lubes is they tend to dry out and become very thick especially on the outside where exposed to air , sometimes within 5 minutes of use . The worse I have tried is the Kroger Brand KY , felt like we had velcro between us.Astroglide is very runny and water like which is one of the reasons we actually like it . It tends to stay runny and resists thickening when exposed to air . Eventually it will thicken ( which is why four stars ) , but it seems all lubricants do this eventually , the meantime seems to be longer with this product .	1
Astroglide has really made a name for itself since its introduction in 1991 , and it is now one of the top-selling personal lubricants . Well , it 's easy to see why ! Astroglide is a water-based lubricant , which means that it is friendly to your body , your toys and your condoms , and it is easy to clean up.Also , some lubricants I have run across have a very odd or bitter taste , which can be distracting during one-on-one time , but Astroglide has a bittersweet taste that , while not great , is definitely not bad . So , if you want a great water-based lube , then join the throng , and get Astroglide ! I highly recommend it ! ! FYI : In general , there are three types of lubricants and each has its pros and cons . Water-based lubes are easy to cleanup and are unlikely to cause yeast infections , but on the down side they do need to be renewed every half hour or less due to drying . Oil-based lubes tend to have maximum slipperiness and last longest , but can lead to yeast infections and tend to break down latex condoms and toys quite quickly . Silicone-based lubes fall in between these two , being slicker and longer lasting than water-based lubes , but they do require longer clean up times , can stain sheets and clothing , and will eventually break down silicone toys . ( Review of Astroglide Personal Lubricant - 5 oz )	1
Of all the lubes I 've tried , and that is a lot to be honest , Astroglide is definitely and tried and true favorite for my sensitive skin . Thank you !	1
Works well , last a long time but it is sticky . If you can handle the sticky part during clean up then you will like this product .	1
My hubby and I really Love this product . It 's smooth and feels natural . It also lasts a long time too !	1
How nice it is to sleep all night without waking up numerous times feeling as though I 'm suffocating ! I used to try to sleep holding my nostril open and , of course , once I got really asleep , I let go and woke up gasping for breath . I 've now found a lifetime sleep aid !	1
At the time of this review this is the very best priced . It 's only about 22.5 cents per unit . That truly beats all the others . But do n't get too excited - this one does not have free shipping and some of the others do . You have to factor that in since it 's an expense . The only way to know the price is to itemize per nasal strip . It does n't matter how many come in a box . What counts is only the price per unit , providing the size unit is your size ( large , medium or small ) .If you shop for the best price right now and are willing to get it by subscription , you can get them for 28 cents per . Even so , it 's not cheap enough over the long run if you intend to use them every night . The price simply has to come down eventually . That 's $ 102.20 per year for this habit at the cheapest price . And it 's just for a little strip that sticks on your nostrils and makes them flare out a little . Of course , it 's a great product because it works . It will definitely help you breathe better at night . The manufacturing costs are low and therefore I 'd like to see the price come down some.Of course , prices change and this one might become the best price per unit at any time . I think that anybody that has tried this product will agree that it works in that it helps one breathe much better during sleep . Yet out of fair play , I strongly believe this product should be reduced in price per unit substantially since it has such a high margin .	1
I have bought these for years now - it 's so nice to be able to breathe through my nose when I sleep .	1
price was ok , but wish there was a larger quantity so the deal was better , these are too high to begin with even tho they work .	1
I 've been using this for about a year and love it . I do n't have any problem keeping it on because I make sure there are no oils on my nose . I have a deviated septum and these have allowed me to not need surgery . They solve the apnea problem .	1
For some time now , I have had one nostril that seems to get clogged up when I go to bed . I tried using a decongestant ( i.e . Sudafed ) , and that would usually work . However , I felt like I was taking too much of it because sometimes I would have to take it nearly every night . I wanted a non-medicine remedy and so I tried these strips . I 'm very happy I did . I do n't know how they work exactly , but they work . And I 've never had a problem with them coming off at night . They seem to stick just right .	1
I must admit I was a total skeptic , but I have been having issues sleeping and a friend recommended these . I am sold ; I physically feel better when I wake up as I sleeping so much better . For the money its an easy fix and much easier to travel with than my buddies breathing machine !	1
I have used Breathe Right off and on over the years and have always been pleased with it . These strips for sensitive skin are really nice .	1
These are so much better than the advanced and the new versions . They go on and come off easily and open your airway passages just fine . I snore and with these it brings down the volume a lot an , I feel like I sleep better . Especially during allergy season . What 's with not offering these in larger packs though ? Guess we 'll just have to keep buying multiples .	1
Ca n't sleep without these at night ! They 're truly wonderful for my deviated septum . I 've recommended them to all my friends . Even great just when you have a cold and nasal congestion .	1
I have used these nightly for over six years . They definitely help me sleep better . I also have had No Allergic Reaction to the adhesive used on the nose strips . This is the best price I have seen on this product , even with shipping they are one half of the usual price !	1
These will really hold your passages open , and they stay on extremely well . Nonetheless , if you have oily skin , I suggest cleaning your skin first with alcohol or something . Best to remove it with an alcohol-soaked Q-tip . If your skin gets raw on the bridge of your nose , you can put a tiny amount of lotion , vaseline , or something ; but only put it right in the place that 's getting sensitive , on the bridge of your nose . It wo n't stick in that tiny spot , but it 'll stick everywhere else and stay on .	1
Breathe Rights are great in reducing snoring . We like these since they stay on all night and do not take off the skin on the nose . The extra strength ones do peel off the skin so we stay with this version .	1
These cloths can be used right out of the package or heated in the microwave . I used them after having ankle surgery . I was unable to walk and needed a way to freshen up in between sponge baths . This product is also good for someone who is in a hospital or nursing home . I would recommend .	1
These bath wipes are amazing . I can not get into a bathtub and we are remodeling our shower , so I ca n't bathe for two weeks . We are one week into the remodeling , and I feel and smell clean . Would I rather be able to take a shower ? Of course , I would . But for the next week , that 's not in the cards . I am so glad I found these bath wipes . They are thick and super wet , plus they smell good . I would highly recommend them to anyone for any reason .	1
I `` discovered '' these bath cloths during a recent hospitalization and was pleased to find them on Amazon.They ca n't be beat for quick clean ups while travelling or camping . So much better than normal wet wipes .	1
These are perfect for keeping clean when unable to properly shower or take a bath while recovering from surgery . Here are my observations : + Thick ; holds up well , even with a good amount of scrubbing+ Microwavable ; adds to comfort+ Refreshing ; these leave me feeling very clean and much better smellingNote that the instructions say the eight cloths in a pack equal one `` bath '' , but I find four more than adequately cleans me up nicely.These work very well and go a long way to making a sick or convalescing person feel much more human.Highly Recommended ! I also recommendedComfort Personal Cleansing Shield Incontinence Care Washcloths 32 eato protect `` delicate areas '' of those who are bedridden.CFH	1
These are perfect . No odor - so my husband uses them when he goes hunting for a quick cleanup . I keep them stashed in the car for quick clean-ups and we have a box in our emergency packs as well .	1
Just like the hospital uses . Great for touch ups between showers or bathes . Antibacterial , moisturizing , pH neutral , deodorizing . No drying necessary . Good for the skin	1
These large thick disposable washcloths are so useful to have on hand . They can be rinsed out and used over and over . I do n't like to remove makeup with my good terrycloth washcloths , it stains them . These can be used several times for that and then clean up the whole bathroom sink area and whatever else needs it . They came promptly and are just like the ones used in the hospital where I first saw them . Great produict . Great service from the dealer .	1
I purchased this Comfort Bath Personal Cleaning Ultra thick wash cloths for a dear friend whose husband has Dementia and has to be taken care of , cleaned up many times a day . He is under Hospice care , in a hospital bed .She is trying to take care of him at home instead of putting him in nursing home . She says these are wonderful and appreciated me getting them for her to use to keep her husband clean . Thanks to who ever made this product it is great .	1
Perfect cleaning cloths if you are a caregiver for an elderly person . With MRSA infections so prevalent , these disposable cloths are a reality . You warm them in the microwave first which is very comforting for an elderly person who gets cold easily . Good cloths , good product and great value priced . Would highly recommend .	1
After a bad fall and hospitalization , this helped me feel fresh when I could n't shower every single day . I am alright now , but keep these on hand JUST IN CASE and also a good thing to take on vacation with you !	1
A bit of warm water while trekking and it made a sponge bath . Used several time before going into the carry out bag . We left no trash behind .	1
My husband REALLY likes this product . I have to wrap his legs every 2 days and in that time he is unable to shower ( which he hates ) finding these cloths have really , really helped . He finds them easy to use and the result most pleasant . He thanks me each time he uses them . I thank the seller and Amazon , BIG TIME !	1
I had to go to the doctor and my bath nurse never came . These `` Comfort Bath Cloths '' really came to my rescue . They are an inch or two larger than a regular sized wash cloth . They are the thickness of felt . This feels really soft against the body . The fragrance is fresh , clean and light . Once you are finished washing the fragrance fades , and you can perfume yourself with the smells you love . There is not even a whiff of bad orders left after you wash. `` Comfort Bath Cloths '' were a delightful surprise that really does what they claim to do . You wo n't be disappointed .	1
these are amazing ! they are useful for removing whatever you need to remove and are gentle on the skin.the size is okay for small jobs	1
I was given these one time when I was in the hospital , remembered them and now i keep them on-hand for home use . They really do clean you up , have a pleasant smell , are soft and comfortable easy to use , and are great for when someone ca n't get in the bath or shower due to injury or illness . I found ideal for camping and although you could n't microwave them , I found you can warm them up with warm water either in a closed package or individually .	1
After surgery : a must have.On a hot day , getting sweat off after doing a bit of housework , or for washing off dusty feet or even mud on arms , perfect . It 's not a shower , but sometimes this is the quickest and quite good enough.I 've never heated them , but I may be this winter as am having another surgery and it will be a cold recovery in the winter in CA . Usually I 'm in a much hotter year-round climate where I always have a package going.I buy them in bulk , so that rates 5 stars .	1
Does the job without residue . Bought these in case we could n't get the water system at a camp site to work . The best plan & # 34 ; B & # 34 ; I 've found .	1
These disposable washcloths are dependable and strong . When our father broke his foot and was unable to take a shower , we heated one of these cloths in the mircowave for about 40 secs . to wash his back and arms . The cost is a little on the high side but they are easy to use and are made of very good quality . The cloths are also great for older seniors who have physical restrictions .	1
I have tried it all . Just refuse to put anything toxic esp aluminum anywhere on my body esp where lymph nodes reside . Strong smell at first , not unpleasant , and then as others say , goes away . Buy from Cosmetic Solutions as date of the date of this review and add multiples . I just bought 6 for approx $ 4 each with only $ 3 shipping . The others say they are super savers but are not and the shipping is very steep .	1
Was tough to find an all natural deodorant that actually keeps my underarms from smelling in the middle of summer .	1
This scent on my boyfriend is amazingly wonderful . I tried it , but it was too strong for me to wear .	1
I really like this deodorant . I tried many , many natural deodorant and this one is the first one that has worked . I 'd say its 80 % effective . If it was summer time or you are working out you will need to reapply . Otherwise for a cold winter day it does the job .	1
This is now my favorite ... I looked everywhere for it , but only found it on Amazon . I like the fragrance , it does what I want a deodorant to do ... and the ingredients are the safest I could find .	1
I was skeptical about this at first , because when I had a flareup and used it , it first burned like the dickens . But that only lasted a few seconds , and gradually I could feel the soothing relief getting stronger and stronger until I was at last pain free . I 'm glad I tried it , it works !	1
I had found this product in the store once and that was it . So once again Amazon came to my rescue . This product is easy to use without any mess . The gel really does have a cooling effect . I 'd recommend this product to anyone who has the occasional need for it .	1
If you find yourself in a situation where you feel like someone has either shoved a tennis ball , itching powder , or a flaming hot coal up your nether regions , this could be the fix.Whether you 're experiencing itching , burning , or just an awkward & quot ; why does it feel like I have a tennis ball in my drawers ? & quot ; , this cooling gel can work wonders .	1
These are inexpensive enough to keep some in my pocket for emergencies . I also use them at the theater . Some times the theater likes to jack up the sound to over ride the ambient sound created by the concentrations of minors , at other times movies change volume between music and dialog . These plugs are efficient in insertion and extraction .	1
I discovered foam ear plugs when I lived in New York City , where they were commonly sold in subway stations . Silicone , plastic , and wax earplugs had proven insufficient defense against loud neighbors and street noise . These foam earplugs were far more effective and comfortable than other types . I think I literally would not have survived years living in places even louder than New York if not for these earplugs . I could n't have slept without them.The ear plugs have a Noise Reduction Rating ( NRR ) of 29 decibels , which is higher than any other ear plugs on the market . They block out a lot of noise , but they are more effective at blocking higher frequency sound than low-frequency . This means that you wo n't be able to hear the telephone if you sleep with ear plugs in , but you might hear the neighbor 's lawn mower . Their effectiveness at blocking out noise from machinery really depends upon the pitch , but foam ear plugs will always lower the volume somewhat . They 're pretty good at blocking background chatter , television , or music.I 've used both Flents `` Quiet ! Please '' and E*A*R brands , which are identical apart from color . Flents are off-white . E*A*R plugs are yellow . They are easy to use . You simply roll the ear plug between your fingers to squish it , then insert it in your ear canal . It expands to fit your ear snugly . Each ear plug can be used a few times before it has to be trashed . If you need noise relief in order to sleep or concentrate , Flents `` Quiet ! Please '' ear plugs will be a great help .	1
This product came in a set of three . I use this because of my sensitive skin and it was recommended by mydoctor . This is a great value for the money ! If you use this , this is a great buy !	1
My daughter suffers from dry toes and at times the skin cracks open very painful . I rub aquaphor on her feet very night and put on cotton socks within a week her toes healed and now they are baby soft . I started applying it on her face as well since her cheeks are always dry and red now they are soft and healthy pink .	1
I purchased Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy because my children have allergies and eczema , I tried other things but I always come back to this product . It works well on their skin . For me it outlasts anything else that I have tried on my children . I am truly satisfied with this product , it is expensive but it 's woth the money .	1
I LOVE THIS PRODUCT ! I quit using vaseline ! This product is VERY Pricey as I paid $ 16+ for a tub at the store . This is the best healing lotion for dry spots even on my face ( NOT EVERY DAY THOUGH ) and `` THE BeST '' chapstick I have ever tried ! This made my dry , cracked winter lips that peel almost every day to every other day with constant use of chapstick ( that did n't help ) restore my lips ... YES this stuff restored my lips back to when I was a baby lol it is so soft and even when you apply at night before bed you still wake up with it moisturized ! ! ! WILL REPURCHASE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE !	1
This is incredibly oily , slippery , etc . for dry skin and if I could get it up I would use it too .	1
So glad I ordered this . With small kids , I find that we always need aquaphor . With the constant handwashing to keep away germs during the winter , both adults and kids have dry chapped hands , so I use this on hands constantly . I apply to my feet and cover with socks to soften them up . I use as a diaper barrier cream sometimes . I use on my daughter 's eczema and in other dry spots . I use on cuts and scrapes to keep them moist and heal . I personally have always tried to find a petroleum alternative because I worry that it is not the healthiest option . But I find that I keep coming back to Aquaphor and just find it so useful . The larger tubs that are more widely available are probably more cost effective , but I really hate sticking my hand into the bottom of a huge tub , and its harder to tote around a costco-size tub . These containers are just the right size to keep one in each room , tuck one in a big diaper bag if needed , send one to daycare , etc . Love that it comes in a 3 pack .	1
My friend recommended I get one of these and I got the best one I could find on Amazon . This works great . It 's been really helpful so far !	1
This is kind of loud , and if I play with the button too much in the dark , on a restart the temperature shown is n't ALWAYS the last temperature it measured . But the product has lasted and I trust it more than the CVS brand I tried . The important thing is not to change brands midway through the same cycle . I 'd buy this again . I have learned where to cover the sound to help make it quieter .	1
After reading many reviews and not wanting to spend a lot on a thermometer , I got this one to chart my temperature while I was trying to get pregnant . That was 2.5 years ago . I still use it and it works just fine . Sometimes it 's hard to get the reading but you know if you have it in your mouth right because it will beep . If you dont want to spend a lot on a thermometer dont hesitate to get this one !	1
I just needed to replace my regular thermometer . It works great . The beeping is not loud as some reviews claim . Works just fine for me .	1
first timer doing the temp . charting but this lil thing has been SO handy ! Easy to use even in the dark , and does n't take very long : D	1
SUPER EASY TO USE . SAVES THE PREVIOUS TEMP JUST IN CASE YOU FORGET TO LOG IT . COMES WITH A NICE LITTLE COVER . GOOD BUY ! !	1
I think that this is doing a great job . It 's my first time using a basal thermometer and I am doing everything like the instructions say . I am TTC so I really hope this is right . For the price , I have to say that I 'd buy this again .	1
I must first admit I love Amazon . They just have everything imaginable . I developed an anal tear and hemorhhoids and was recommended by my doctor to get a donut cushion to ease pressure on my rear when I sit at the computer which is hours a day . I went to my local drugstores , hardware stores and department stores to no avail . No one had what I needed . I purchase a great deal from Amazon and said let me check there . And voila , they had many to choose from.I chose this Carex rubber inflatable cushion and am thrilled with it . It more than serves the purpose and is ultra comfortable . With some of these cushions you need a pump to inflate it . Here you just very easily blow it up yourself and it takes a mere couple of minutes . Right away it eased the pressure from my bottom when sitting and also helped my posture get better when sitting which helps my back . My health issues are over but the rubber cushion remains . It is so comfortable that I prefer to sit on it even though my desk chair is comfortable.Also imoportant to note , I blew this up and started using it over 1 month ago andd it has not deflanted at all and I have not had to put any more air in it . And I weigh 280 pounds . So believe me , this cushion is a must and I highly recommend it . Also , what a great price !	1
Carex Inflatable Ring Cushion , RubberProduct works great . Very sturdy and helps relieve pressure on your seat bottom . I bought this for my mom who is wheelchair bound . She likes it a lot .	1
This cushion is of much higher quality than I was expecting . The rubber is thick and the valve is made of brass . You 'll need a good set of lungs to inflate it but that 's not a bad thing , it 's good exercise . My tailbone hgealed befor it arrived so I have n't got to use it but if I ever develop hemorrhoids , I 'm all set .	1
Had surgery recently and my doctor has recommended that I purchase a ring cushion prior to having the surgery . Researched it on Amazon and selected this one . Everyone is correct ... the rubber smell is quite overwhelming but it is not nearly so noticeable when you are sitting on it . Got me home from the hospital in comfort and on the road to recovery .	1
Wife was really pleased when i ordered this , she used it both before the baby and after the baby and reported it did the job .	1
My father needs one of these but the foam types are just too firm . He likestis one because you can adjust the firmness . We put it in a pillowcase when traveling for discreetness . Easy to inflate by mouth , no pump needed .	1
I have problems with my coccyx ( tailbone ) hurting when I sit , and this pillow works for me . The only thing I hate is the rubber smell .	1
I 've had coccyx pain for a few months and I just new I had to find something for a trip that would involve 14 hrs straight on a train and several 5 hour day trips . It needed to be durable , packable and cleanable . This was the perfect find . It 's made of sturdy rubber , it inflates very quickly to your desired level . It 's very easy to clean with a lysol towel and the best thing is that I was able to carry it in my purse during those day trips when not in use . It takes the space of a sweater , it folds in 4 when not inflated leaving you with about 12 & # 34 ; triangles . It 's not very light even when not inflated but the comfort it gives my back is worth carrying around . I even carried it around during a tennis tournament and the relief it gives my back is so worth it . Recommended for those with back pain .	1
After trying a dozen different creams and a supplement , I think getting pressure off hemorrhoids is the only way I can keep them calmed down . I ordered one for the car as well . Sturdy , made of thick rubber , affordable ; wish it had a removable , washable cover to match , but overall it 's a keeper . I just slip it into a pillow case for aesthetics . It does have a rubber smell , because it 's new rubber . I suspect over time , the new car smell will fade like most of these types of products . Now I am going to look for a hot water bottle too .	1
It does what it is supposed to do . It 's easy to inflate to the proper pressure and it 's easy to keep clean .	1
What can I say . It works great . Only those with hemorrhoids can understand the relief this little tube can bring.This small inner tube sits on the toilet seat . Drape a steamy hot towel over the top , then sit on it . It offers much relief once seated on the hot , moist towel . Remain seated for 15 minutes or so , and Voila ! Relief at last.Amazon also has the Sitz bath available , which offers a small tub of water which sits on the toilet seat . Rather than the towel pressure , you actually feel the hot water.The pressure of a steaming towel always worked better for me . But , either of these items is reasonably priced so that you could try one or both at a small price for the relief they offer .	1
This thing is bottom saver . but it stinks like rubber . i even tried soaking it in bathtub of pinesole and colorox it didnt work . but the bad part is it leaks the smell over to anything it touches . i like it i put a pillow case over it but the smell is strong	1
Sitting on this cushion is really helping my pelvic floor disorder . I have to keep the weight off my pelvic floor , and this really does the job . It allows the weight to hit my sit bones versus the pelvic floor . Normally I would not be able to sit very long , but this cushion allows me to . It 's especially helpful in the car with all the bumps and jolts . FYI : It 's best to put a small hair towel over it because if you 're wearing shorts or a dress , your skin will stick and it 's painful . Plus , it leaves a funny design on your skin . : ) I have not re-inflated it yet , and it 's been a month plus . I also keep a towel over the cushion in the car so no one sees it , as much . I find it 's a great value and I just purchased another one . Amazon 's price is cheaper than in the store . I can imagine it 's good for hemorrhoids or post birth too . It 's a good investment .	1
The price is right , and the product is great . My Mom is a senior with COPD and other serious health issues , and this has been a life saver for her . She can soak as long as she wants to help her feel `` refreshed . '' We use a small tub , filled with fragrant bubble bath , to soak her feet , and this methods lets her maintain her dignity , when she ca n't make it upstairs to take a full tub bath . When this one cracks or begins to wear out , I will certainly buy another.God bless the inventor of the Sitz bath ! ! !	1
Worked great with some Lamaze salts after the birth of DD # 3 . Soothed all the areas that needed soothing . I just with I had more time to sit on it ! ! I did n't use the bag and tubing , I just filled it with warm water and salts .	1
Does the job but made of thin plastic . Does n't hold up real good but serves the purpose . When it is completely wore out will have too order another one probably wo n't be the same one . Get a different supplier threw Amazon .	1
This was for my boyfriend since he has hemorrhoid problems often . Since he refuses to go to spas and saunas , I made him do these baths on the toilet for 20 minutes and they helped a lot . It helps with cuts and swelling and the heat helps shrink hemorrhoids . I like to use it with Motherlove Sitz Bath ( has witch hazel ) to make it soothing as well .	1
I used this to get comfort for fisher and hemorrhoids regularly and this helped me a lot . very light weight and easy to use after every bowl movement .	1
This Sitz is a good deal . Great price and does the job . The front is starting to crack a bit , but I do n't intend to use it forever ! Temporary relief at this price is AWESOME . Would buy again .	1
Did exactly what it was suppose to do . Quality made product , and a reasonable price . You cant go wrong with Carex products .	1
I had to have a rectal fistulotomy and hemorrhoidectomy . I am a plus sized woman ( wear sz 26-28 ) and was so worried about finding a sitz bath that would & # 34 ; hold up & # 34 ; through my recovery . This was a blessing ! The pan is STRONG and I used it daily x4 weeks without any cracking or problems . We have an elongated toilet bowl , the lid did not fit over the pan , but it was no big deal . The pan is comfortable to sit on directly . I am thrilled with the purchase .	1
An elderly family member has been using this simple yet well-designed and durable plastic Carex Sitz Bath ( from the German `` sitzen '' to sit ) for the past 5 years or so and it is still as useful as on the first day that we received it in April 2009.If you have had surgery , suffer from hemorrhoids or other painful , irritating/inflammatory conditions in the nether regions of the human body , then this is truly an indispensable item to have available around the house . There 's nothing quite like a little `` sitzen '' on this standard toilet bowl insert when it contains nice warm , soothing water perhaps with just a bit of Epsom salt or medicinal oatmeal powder to take edge off of what ails you in this regard.If you are elderly ( 70s + ) , then this also can prove to be a very useful item for essential daily hygiene without the need to take a shower or bath every day , something that is difficult to do when those joints - especially the knees - start giving out from natural deterioration due to a life fully lived over the years.The person in my family who still regularly uses this item falls into this latter category of strictly hygienic and non-medicinal use and has always only used the plastic insert itself . There has never been a need to use the 2-quart solution bag that is included.If when you get on in years the height of the standard bathroom toilet proves to be too low for you to comfortably sit down and then get back up again with this Carex Sitz Bath insert in place , then you might want to consider combining this item with a height-adjustable `` Bedside Commode/Toilet Seat/Safety Rails - All in One '' ( see my review ) .You can essentially substitute this Carex Sitz Bath for the gray bucket that comes with this commode and turn it into a portable bidet whenever the need arises with the added convenience of being able to adjust the height for the easy sitting down and arising of an elderly person or anyone - irrespective of age - with hip/knee problems.For the modest price of less than $ 15.00 being asked ( I paid about $ 10.00 in 2009 ) , this is a must-have item for overall health and general well-being .	1
Woah , does it work ! ! I had to cut back on the intervals recommended on the directions , just so I could go out and be human.But it SURE cleanses ! After cutting back on my own specific dosage , it still worked but I did n't have to `` run out of the office '' several times a day ... ... .It 's a good cleanse ! ! And yes , I DO recommend it for you Amazonians out there -- just try it at home for the first few days to get an idea of what it does for you , as you may have to adjust your dosage too .	1
I have used this years ago and it does work however I am older now and I have HighBlood Pressure but I am on Lisinopril . I know Licorice and Glucomanann can raised BP up.I also know that if it is low on the list of ingredients it means the product contains only a small minute amount . So I was wondering if anyone knew if the later licorice is safe to take as the Licorice tea is.Thx Medicine	1
I just finished the 30 day cleanse last week . I did it for the entire 30 days . I never used the bathroom so much in my life - but it was a wonderful thing . I felt `` cleaned '' out and I like that - the bloating went away , my tummy was flatter , my skin looked brighter and I lost 6 pounds ! ! However , one week after the cleanse I have gained most of it back and I am feeling constipated again - this is not a permanent cleanse but I definitely enjoyed feeling great for 30 days . I would try this product again .	1
After just one weeks use I have been totally regular . I still have plenty left in case I need it again .	1
We always do a spring cleaning with this product ! Great results ! ! Try it you will like it . Not to harsh like some .	1
I am in the military and I work hard at eating clean . Sometimes in the field for work though I ca n't avoid eating & # 34 ; Army food & # 34 ; . It is not clean or healthy . the point of Army chow is to fill you up and keep you in enough carbs and calories to keep you going to harsh conditions . Well I am a small female that gains fat very easy . I take two of each in the morning and two of each at night and it really keeps me happy . I do n't get bloated or fatigued from all the heavy food . I do n't think it will keep weight off but it will keep it from slowing you down during low hot training.P.s . You should n't take this stuff for too long as it contains a tree bark that can darkness your colon and make it hard for doctors to see anything going on down there during testing . Also for a couple of people I know it makes them have to run to the bathroom often so I would start slow .	1
Honestly , this works so well.. I also have used the super cleanse product by nature 's secret and that never fails to produce results as well .	1
I 've been using this product everyday for the last ten years . It works wonders on the immune system as far as a detoxification goes . I recommend this to anyone having intestinal problems . At Whole Foods it was $ 30 a box . I got it for a great price on amazon .	1
I have been on the product for 3 weeks as of this writing ; and , it works as it claims . I am regular for the first time in memory ( I am 62 ) . I definitely feel less bloating , less cramping , and thankfully , less constipation . My personal regimen is to take 1 herbal and 1 fiber the first thing in the morning before breakfast . I am good for the day . I have more energy and I like the way my GI tract is on a normal balance each day .	1
Good product	1
My doctor recommended this product to me . I suffer from the Epstein Bar Virus ( EBV ) and chronic fatigue syndrome at times . The amino acids in this product do help with EBV symptoms . I take this product along with colostrum ; both products combined make a big difference with the EBV and chronic fatigue .	1
This product helps me do my job day after day - Thanks to CFS I have never experienced severe muscle fatigue and have been able to hike and do landscaping day after day with no loss of strength or endurance . Now I work 4-6 hours a day as a package handler with the same great results . More output and maintaining steady results .	1
Excellent product . Would recommend to all those interested in creatine . Definitley worth the price and lasts a while . Would buy again .	1
real dramatic.. i know.. and im not an overdramatic person.. but in the last week and a half my sinuses had been getting worse and worse ... and tonight i couldnt breathe at all.. abnormally bad ... like im being smothered ... especially out the left side where i messed up that side of my nose a couple years ago ... did something to the cartilage and can never breathe out that side more than halfway ... during allergy season not at all ... i just used an air purifier a couple days ago and my sinuses actually got worse since then ... tonight was the worsebut in the middle of googling proplyhexedrine ( the main ingrediant ) i decided to just go ahead and smell it ... not sniff it ... since i read a couple bad things on side effects ... but 5 secs after i did i could already feel a difference ... i wasnt even trying to use it like normal ... just wanted to smell it ... so i went ahead and used it on my worse side thinking its not gon na work ... didnt sniff that hard again .. just kinda waved it front of my nose ... and secs later i felt that side doing something ... my right side wheezed for about 10 minutes.. ( a lil air was coming through ) never wheezed before.. and now 20 - 25 mins later im completely clear after a week and a half of hardly no airway and getting worse ... WTH ? ? dam thats good ! ... i didnt even stick it in my nose.. i just waved itthis thing is way better than a neti pot ... i used the neti pot earlier and was still stuffy as hell ... never used anything this good on my sinuses ... did read something about it could be addictive and maybe bad side effects but this stuff saved me from a night of misery.. probably wouldnt of been able to get any sleep at all.. not breathingthis is my first time using this stuff but it definitley wont be my last	1
I have had surgery on my nose and still have had many problems breathing through it over the years and have tried several nasal decongestants over the years BENZEDREX works excellent , BUT I am not fan of the scent . It quickly opens up the nasal passage helping me breathe but unfortunately the scent it is not the most pleasant scent , in my opinion but you may enjoy it . One thing I will say is it WORKS WELL ! So I Recommend this product if you have problems nasal breathing .	1
I was absolutely suffering before I came across the reviews for this product . I could n't breathe for MONTHS , I thought I was going to have to get some kind of surgery or something . I was popping nasal decongestant pills like M & Ms , to no avail . But holy cow , this stuff is amazing ! ! One caveat : it wo n't work if your nose is 100 % blocked ( which mine USUALLY was ) , because obviously you need to be able to inhale to use this . But when you get a little break in the action and there 's even a hint of a clear airway , pop this baby in , inhale and BREAAAAATHE ! ! ! Love it , love it , love it .	1
I have a chronic problem with nasal congestion ; I have one of those narrow noses which sometimes gets stopped up . I have found the Benzedrex inhaler to be very helpful in providing quick relief when I 'm out . The effects are good for about two hours when the inhaler is new and then began to taper off as it ages.I have one in my pocket at this very moment and am pleased to say that I have n't needed it all day ; there is comfort in knowing that it 's there if I do need it.I 've found it works better than any other inhaler that I 've used that is available over the counter .	1
Great for stuffy/plugged nose , sinus congestion , sinusitis , allergic response . Read the precautions and med/drug contraindications first to see if it will be safe for you . Better than a nose spray for me . Not good at night-time as it is a stimulant but great for daytime use . Follow the directions and Google information on the drug .	1
It does work , but I found it more effective at some times rather than others . It seemed better at making stronger congestion less noticeable than it did in reducing slight congestion down to nothing . In other words , I felt little relief if congestion was minor , but very noticeable relief when I was more congested.The one other complaint I have is that I found it slightly difficult to use at times of heavier congestion - or at least , less effective ... because think about it - it 's a NOSTRIL inhaler ... if you are congested , getting a good inhale through the nostrils could be difficult . A good strong inhale is needed because there is this `` ball-like '' mechanism that lifts up in the inhaler that seemed to allow more vapors through . To combat weak inhales , I simply tipped it upside down during use.Size is similar to lip balm , so it 's easily pocketable .	1
This stuff will open up any kind of congestion . You could probably unclog your sink with Benzedrex . It 's the shiz , fo sho !	1
I love these inhalers . I stumbled across it at either CVS or RiteAid once and I ca n't imagine being without it . I 've actually been searching for them at drugstores but cant find them again , I 'm SO happy Amazon carries it . Amazon Rocks ! ! If you have a stuffy nose from allergies or a cold , this seriously clears you up right away and keep you clear for hours . Inhale and soon you 'll no longer have a stuffy nose . It works great to prevent snoring too.Vic 's inhaler only works for a short period of time . This one works really really well !	1
PACKAGINGThe outer packaging is a tough nut to crack , and while child-safe , it 's a bit of a challenge for adults , even with scissors . The inhaler itself is made of sturdy plastic and feels well made.SCENT/AROMAIf you are accustomed to Vicks Inhalers , with their distinctive camphorous menthol and eucalyptus aroma , the Benzedrex inhaler will be a bit change for you . Lavender plays a starring role in this aromatic blend , backed with an ample dose of menthol , the overall effect is much more `` aromatherapy '' like , as opposed to Vicks ' cool , purely medicinal notes.INGREDIENTS & EFFICACYThe active ingredient in Benzedrex is propylhexidrine , a drug related structurally to methamphetamine ( related does not mean 'same as ' ) . When inhaled , it opens up the nasal passages and sinuses , relieving pressure and congestion . Vicks inhalers active ingredient is levmetamfetamine , also an amphetamine derivative that works in much the same way.In my experience Vicks and Benzedrex are about equally effective immediately after use , but Benzedrex works much much longer -- in the hours range versus minutes with Vicks , which also makes it a better value in my opinion.IT 'S FOR YOU IF ... - You want decongestant relief , but do n't want to take anything in pill form , or want to give your oral decongestant an added boost- You like lavender , or can at least tolerate the scent- You are a Vicks inhaler user looking for a longer-lasting upgradeTHINK TWICE IF ... - You are opposed to buying online -- I live in a major metro area and have never seen Benzedrex carried at a pharmacy , though this may be a 'regional thing'.RECOMMENDED : Yes .	1
I 've been using this for years . This three-pack was delivered quickly , and at a price much lower than Walgreen 's or CVS .	1
This stuff is wonderful . It works immediately and there are no sneezing side effects that I get from other inhalers . I am so tired of taking pill decongestants which always leave me very thirsty . If your nose is continually stopped up like mine from pollution , dust , etc . then you need to use this . It 's worth every penny .	1
It is really hard at times to find the 'Benzedrex Nasal Inhaler ' in stores now a-days , once you find out the BEST of the BEST , you wo n't settle for Less . I sure hope Amazon keeps selling them because we will be back for more , we bought two packages of 3 ( 6 inhalers total ) , THANKS FOR READING MY POST , Bob in Mesa , AZ !	1
The benzedrex inhaler is the best one on the market . You usually can not find it readily available in stores and will probably have to order from Amazon . Do n't waste your money on other brands . Nothing will reduce stuffiness and actually decrease swelling like the benzedrex inhaler . Keep a new one around especially during the allergy and cold season .	1
Our eye specialist MD recommended this product . It works perfectly , no burning or irritating to the eyes , but replaces tears you do n't have to irrigate the eyes . Ordering from Amazon allows us to buy in bulk with less hassle .	1
Nice drops , but I found out I was having allergy issues , but these are very good drops especially at night ,	1
These eye drops are very good for my severely dry eyes . I like that they are essentially preservative free . They were very 'jell-like ' which I did n't quite expect . They work well and they dispense well into the eye .	1
Single pack of day time dry eye relief . It 's more practical to buy the double pack if you plan to use this product regularly .	1
Has a decent selection of supplies . A little big for backpacking or carrying on your person , but this is a nice kit to keep in the car or RV	1
I bought this to keep in my car for when I go camping or out hiking the trails . I havent needed anything that wasnt in the kit so far	1
This was purchased as a replacement for the first aid kit in an old home 3 day emergency kit , and I 'm very satisfied with the purchase . Although it says that it is an outdoor kit , it has most of the things from our old kit , plus a number of others . There were , however , a few other things that we purchased separately to add in that you may also want to purchase : electrolyte tablets , insta cloths ( condensed cloths that expand with water ) , iodine tablets , benadryl tablets , and small bottle of bleach ( not really first aid , but we keep it in the kit as an emergency water disinfection option ) .There was a large enough quantity of many items that I took a portion of some of them and put them into a fanny pack for our very small hiking/outdoor first aid kit.Overall , very good and I would buy this kit again as the most complete one I could find for the intended purpose .	1
To be honest I bought this one in haste without any research of any other kits and I do n't regret it one bit . Although its a bit unorganized it has everything you need and is very simple and compact . I was looking through the other kits today and they barely give a description of what comes with it ( the ones that are the same size as this one ) . The case is a bit soft but the orange color stands out whenever someone needs to find it . I keep this one in my car and I 'm probably going to buy one for my house soon .	1
This is exactly the kit I was looking for to keep in my ATV . It contains a generous supply of the basics for injuries and minor wounds that might occur in remote areas . Although it contains two small rolls of medical tape , I 've found that a large roll of tape sufficient to wrap sprained ankles , wrists or to bandage a puncture wound always comes in handy . Add that item . This kit is light-weight and fits perfectly into an ATV saddle bag . The flexible nylon container allows for extra items that might be desired - and the bright-orange color keeps it easily visible in the woods if you are working an emergency away from the vehicle , so you will not lose it in the leaves .	1
Nice first aid kit . Everything came neatly organized . There are numerous clear plastic pockets on the inside to divide different components . There is room to add additional items inside as well . Giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the case/zipper do not seem to be as durable as I would like .	1
I 've come to realize that there is no such thing as the `` perfect '' first-aid kit , with absolutely everything one needs in it . However , this is a very good kit as a `` starting point '' . Other reviewers have documented what is included in the kit , so I wo n't rehash that . What 's included is of good quality- be sure to check the expiration dates , when applicable , and replace as needed . I check monthly to make sure all is up-to-date & not used up.I added the following items on my own ( I hope this helps anyone trying to prepare their `` ultimate '' first-aid kit ) - 1 small bottle of eyewash ; 1 tube of Cortaid ( for itching from sources besides bug bites ) ; 1 packet of Dayquil liqui-gels ( for daytime cold relief/prevention & sinus/allergy attacks ) ; 1 digital thermometer ; 1 tube of Neosporin ; 1 packet of Nyquil liqui-gels ( for nighttime cold relief/prevention ) ; 1 tube of Oragel ; 1 packet of 6 Pepto-Bismol ( gas/bloating/stomach pain/nausea ) ; 4 packets of Loperamide ( diarrhea ) ; Nexcare waterproof bandages of various sizes- while a lot of band-aids are in this kit , I need waterproof ones , too , and that 's not included here.Considering the cost of this kit alone , this is not a lot that I had to add . It is very important to have a kit at work , at home & in one 's vehicle . I recommend buying this , with the advisement that you need to add a few extras to be prepared for emergencies that almost inevitably come up .	1
This product came shipped promptly , and came just as advertised as the title says.We purchased this first-aid kit for our bug-out kits . As an adjunct , we added a few other things like different gauses and some creams in order to 'beef it up ' so to speak . Nothing wrong with it ! We were just personalizing it a bit , since we have a few people that might need a few other allergy pills and such more often than not.This product would be great for bug out bags , get home bags , camping trips or simply to have around the home . We are VERY glad to have gotten it and it beats anything you would be able to get at the store for the price . Highly recommend it .	1
I had used one for several years , but the top finally would not stay on . I found a new one on here , so I bought it . I like the device for the ability to adjust the penetration depth , as well as it 's simple to function . I may just buy another or two just to have .	1
This smaller version of the One Touch Lancing Device ; works with my existing `` lancets '' , which is good and is a fine replacement/additional device ; since I could n't buy the clear `` cap '' ; for my original , which I lost/discarded . And since the parts are n't interchangeable with the original , I 'm doing a much better job of keeping things together . This is an essential part of my daily blood sugar testing and was reasonably priced here , for what I saw elsewhere .	1
I bought this penlet back in 2000 . It has been working great now for 11 years . That 's pretty good for a piece of plastic . It seems fairly sturdy . I use it with One Touch UltraSoft lancets and I have the Penlet Plus set at a low setting of about three . I am always able to get a drop of blood with one try . The shallow prick does not hurt my finger .	1
The only thing that gets me through the day with an old wrist injury that nobody can figure out what is wrong . Best brace out of all the brands . A+	1
This is an excellent stabilizing brace -- but sizing can be an issue.My husband nearly broke his wrist ; fortunately it was `` only '' a serious sprain . He was told to wear a brace for 2-3 weeks , so off we trotted to the store to find one.A few years ago , he 'd had a bad bout with carpal tunnel , and was very pleased with the right-handed version of the Futuro model . Alas , the store did n't have a left-handed model , so he bought another brand . It was n't two days before I scurried to Amazon to buy this replacement . ( The other one was made largely of plastic , with open spaces and a total lack of support around his wrist , where he needed it . It also got stinky in a hurry . But they cost about the same ; go figure . ) This one works well because it supports the entire wrist , not just a couple of spots . It does n't chafe , either , despite the 12 hours a day he spent at the keyboard . ( `` My client has a deadline , honey ! '' & lt ; sigh > ) And , based on the wear he gave the one for the other wrist , a few years back , it holds up . Hopefully you wo n't need to wear this for long , but it 's good to know it wo n't fall apart.The only problem is that he is definitely a `` medium '' and the small/medium is just a tiny bit too small , and the company 's guidelines are n't very helpful . If you 're close to the numbers they have for `` medium , '' order the next size up ! I wish they made a true `` medium '' !	1
Incredibly effective product . Cleared my acne , blackheads , and oily skin . Though , like most , I wish they had an a la carte option - I have a whole lot of benzol peroxide left over and it would be a waste to throw it away .	1
My now 15-year-old son has now been using these pills for more than six months . He definitely can tell the difference when he has n't used it . Although it has n't gotten rid of his acne , it has minimized the severity of the breakouts . He used this regimen in conjunction with the Carley 's Clear & Smooth Acne Treatment for Teens scrub and soap . He has not used the vanishing cream much .	1
Update after 3 months : I am taking the 3rd pack of the pills , and I have to say that it is helping . My back is almost clear . It is way better than it was before I started . I rarely miss a dose so I am pretty consistent . I 've taken Minocycline and Tetracycline before and those pills made me sick to my stomach and very dizzy . Nature 's Cure has no side-effects except a little dry skin on my face , which is ok . The doctor said that if Minocycle wo n't help , we should start Accutane , which is known for very bad side effects . Forget that , I 'm continuing Nature 's Cure.I just received my second order . I am giving it 4 stars because I 'm still waiting to see how much it 'll clear up . But I 've seen improvements already . My back was pretty bad and now it does n't break out much . I 'm gon na give it 5 stars if it clears even more . I would get a pimple here and there on my face , but I 'm not getting as many on my face either now . I did n't use the cream the first time though , but I started using it now on my face .	1
I am a 28y and have suffered from acne for years ! I bought this because of all the reviews and now I am halfway through the pills and everyone has noticed ! The only thing I 'd like is a supply of the pills and the pills alone as I do n't really care for the ointment . I am wondering if anyone has tried clearzine ... seems to be the same thing but just the pills but I am reluctant to switch to something I do n't know anything about . I will be purchasing this again for now and now that I know something actually works I 'll be recommending it to others . I do n't understand why doctors do not recommend this if it works so well .	1
I purchase his oil a while back this oil is such a great softner , I mix this oil in my hair products and my home made conditioners .	1
By far the best Vitamin E product Ive bought in a long time ! Quality vs price is great ! Thank you for such a great product !	1
I love Vit E oil . Jason 's makes a superior product . I wish it came in a larger bottle . Great Buy .	1
I used this oil along with other oils and shea butter as a moisturizer for my hair and skin . I really love the mixture .	1
I bought b/c I wanted 100 % E oil , but I figured I 'd try this out anyway . So glad I did . 1st ingredient ( sunflower oil ) , as well as a few others are the same as Weleda Skin Food , which I love . This is great stuff , I 've noticed a difference after a week or so . I have tried a LOT of skin care products and I do think this one does it better than really expensive creams . I have acne prone dry skin , concerns about aging and wrinkles ( I 'm 37 ) . I use it on face , eyes , neck , hands , elbows . as long as I have a very clean face and hands when applying , then this seems to not cause any acne . it is rather thick , but I like that , b/c other oils ( coconut , olive , jojoba etc ) alone are not thick enough to keep my face moisturized through the night . ( very dry air ! ) anyhow this is awesome b/c I was spending so much trying to find the right creams/ lotions ... i was going to try to make my own , but I think I may have found my answer ... if I have any further issues w/ this stuff I 'll update ! Oh -- PS it does n't seem to have any questionable ingredients ( no parabens or preservatives , etc ) -- although the E oil is synthetic , apparently .	1
Excellent , all natural product . No chemicals whatsoever ( parabens , phalates , sulfates , etc ) . The oil is a beautiful amber color and perfectly clear ( nothing floating ) . I am using this to make my own moisturizer . I am extremely happy with the results . High recommend .	1
I read about this in a magazine who recommended it for dry winter skin and dry scalp . I have not used it on my scalp yet , but I have used it on my face , legs and cuticles and its really nice . A little on the oily side , so you do n't need to use a lot ... .but it has really helped with my ragged cuticles and itchy legs .	1
I order this for myself and like all my oils etc my husband and son used it . Now they love it and I am now ordering it for them . : )	1
I recently started making my own hair and body products and decided to give this oil a try . I love it . Vitamin E oil has so many uses . It is an excellent moisturizer and is very light and non greasy and is very good for hair growth . This oil is great and it mixes very well with other oils and products .	1
I really know that my skin was happy every time I put this thing , My acne scar feed out a little bitI would love to order this one more time , it it natural and safe !	1
I use these every day . At this dose I can wear the patch for 24 hours a day with only mildly vivid dreams ( I have those anyway so it 's not a big deal ) . The constant dose works for me , plus I chew 2 pieces of 2mg Nicorette gum 12 and 16 hours after applying the new patch . NicoDerm works better than other patches I 've used . They stay on better and the dose is steadier . Any patch will wane over time but these are as constant as you can get.I chew the gum in addition because I need slightly more than the 7mg but not as much as the 14mg patch . I smoked a low-nicotine brand so the 14mg was too much , let alone the 21mg . I had some withdrawal by starting with the 7mg but that subsided after 3 days and I 've done fine ever since . You can gauge which works best for you but too much nicotine is as bad as too little so I recommend a conservative approach ( i.e . start with the 21mg only if you were a heavy smoker ) . It 's been six weeks for me and I do n't even think about cigarettes anymore . No more cough , no more sinus problems , no more smell , and I 'm very happy.I have purchased these patches on sale plus a $ 15 off coupon at the pharmacy . The Subscribe and Save Amazon price used to be comparable to that but it 's since risen . Amazon currently charges $ 38.98 ( $ 2.78 / patch ) Prime and $ 33.13 on Subscribe and Save . I got them for $ 25 on sale plus the coupon . Currently you can get them for $ 34.00 and free shipping at this link : B0000536V6I 'll probably go right on using the patches . Previous attempts to quit and give up nicotine altogether failed . As my doctor said , it 's the smoking that kills you . He said it would be okay for me to try it long-term . I recommend a conversation with a doctor if you 're considering doing that . Whatever works ... good luck ! Update : I did end up switching to the 14mg during waking hours only and that worked better for me ( plus no gum needed ) . Also , my insurance company covers them for free so be sure to check with them first .	1
I do not smoke but I bought this because I read scientific studies that it is suppose to help with memory and help prevent the onset of Alzheimer 's which runs rampant in my family . Both of my parents died with it . It does in fact improve short term memory but it had a second effect I did n't expect and that is it helped to do away with my crazy appetite . I have lost 15 lbs since putting this patch on every day . The only side effect I can tell that might bother some people is it makes your arm or wherever you put it on your body itch just temporarily for a few minutes after application . If you use it make sure you change up the place you put it each day .	1
Husband has finally quit smoking . I could not be happier and his health has improved , no wheezing at night and smoker 's cough is gone . Thank you Nicoderm .	1
Most stores no longer carry the level 3 patch , and if they do , it is very expensive . This was a good price , arrived promptly , and the patches were in the original packaging .	1
I was quitting smoking , and these worked , I did n't even use the entire box . I stopped 5 years ago and have never desired one again	1
I love NicoDerm . It really helps with quitting smoking however the Step 3 was a bit too low in dosage for me so I was n't able to follow through . The Step is much better because it contains twice as much nicotine at the Step 3.I realized that once you get to Step 3 you have to have dedication and determination to follow through with quitting smoking so that 's what I have to work on . But NicoDerm really does work ! !	1
I bought these for a friend after using them my self to successfully give up smoking ... .they work ! ! ! The best thing i ever did was try these . They are an excellent product .	1
I purchased just this pack of Nicoderm CQ and used it until the end and until now , I have n't returned back to smoking . I quit completely YEAH ! ! ! ! I guess my will power was stronger to overcome this BIG money guzzler ! I 'm very happy that I did quit and I can say proudly that this product did help ! !	1
My husband is no longer smoking and he feels great and that means everything to me . This is a really great price for the patches and I will be ordering the final two weeks Step Three . So happy that this product works so effectively .	1
I bought these for my husband who was trying to quit . They work well for a pack a day smoker to start on their road to quitting . He found that after a few weeks he did n't need one everyday . Unfortunately , he must have developed an allergy after about 3 weeks , and he had huge welts when he would take the patch off . Just be aware this could happen , even after weeks of use .	1
The patch helped my nicotine cravings . The first few days were the most challenging , as all my habits and smoking places had to be avoided . But the physical nicotine craving was taken care of by the patch . The patch helped minimize my intense cravings for nicotine . I would never have been able to quit smoking without this patch . It 's been four weeks now and I 'm still not smoking -- and I 'm still wearing the patch , but wearing the Step 3 with less nicotine . What has changed is that some days I forget to put on the patch until after lunch or later ... my early morning nicotine cravings have sort of dwindled away . I wo n't lie to you -- I still have moments of heavy cravings , but they 're temporary and have been fairly easy to overcome . And they are getting less frequent . If you want to quit smoking , try the patch.Update as of August 27 , 2008 : Still not smoking . I highly recommend the patch.Update as of October 24 , 2010 : Still not smoking . No urge to smoke . No relapses since quitting . As I said , I could n't have quit on my own . The patch really helped . I wanted to add that when I was using the patch , I would sometimes cut it in half with scissors so that I could control how much nicotine I got . They do n't recommend it on the instructions , but if you find that when you 're using these that you are feeling a little too pumped up with nicotine or kind of lightheaded , maybe you only need half . Cut the patch and wear half of it and therefore you 'll get a lesser amount if needed . Just a tip I thought of . But definitely ask your doctor about doing this to make sure he or she agrees . What works for one person may not work for someone else .	1
I would recommend these to anyone that wants to quit , I was a 3 pack smoker and with the help of these patches , I have not smoked in 5 years	1
I 've tried to quit so many times , Nicoderm CQ was the only thing that has worked , been tobacco free since October 2013 . The only recommendation I would give someone trying this is that if you were a heavy tobacco user , do the last step for an additional 1-2 weeks	1
this was a gift for a loved one . Said it worked better than most of them out there . This was time released .	1
However in the short run you become dependable on this . Make sure u dont run out.You will need them untill your habit stops.The day u dont have access to even 1 patch , you will need a cig	1
I use this 2-4 times a week on my face , makes my face look bright and radiant , while I have little to no breakouts while using it	1
Works great , although works better for me with the use of 2 times a week . My non sensitive skin seems to have new pimples if I use this everyday . Would recommend to others which a great deal like this . Much cheaper than stores .	1
I love apricot scrub and this product is the best . The price is also great on amazon . I would recommend this product !	1
I am an avowed product junkie . I 've been to both ends of the high to low spectrum in terms of experimenting with skin care on a quest to find the perfect combination of products that will get the results I want . The key to reviews on skin care products is to remember that everyone 's skin is different , and experimentation is key to finding the right balance for it.That being said , I am in my early twenties , I have oily/combination skin , and dreadful unevenness of skin tone due to acne scarring . I stayed away from apricot scrubs when I was younger because they caused breakouts . However , now that my hormones have ceased wreaking havoc , this product has become an absolute necessity in my healthy-skin routine . I use it once a day , after my normal cleanser.Since I have begun using this apricot scrub , my skin has been noticeably clearer , much smoother , and the uneven pigmentation has become much , much less apparent . Moisturizer is absorbed much quicker and my pore are less obvious . These results are the closest I have come to the goal of repairing my skin , ever - and simply with a tube of $ 7 product . St. Ives hit the nail on the head with this one.Also to be noted is St. Ives attention to natural ingredients and their attention to the environment . For those of us concerned with such things , it 's nice to know I 'm not slathering potentially harmful chemicals all over my body .	1
Rich and smooth and gives a good scrub ! For the price very very good . Feels clean and smells great ! I scrub day and night neck included . Love it !	1
This is one of the all time best facial scrubs on the market . You can spend tons of money on more expensive scrubs but this does a better job and is much more economical than most . You would be a fool to waste your money on other facial scrubs .	1
I have been using this stuff for about 2 yrs and I have been keeping up with it since the first time I used it . The scrubbing particles really leave you with a clean feeling and it works better than other facewashes I have tried .	1
I 've been using many of the St. Ives scrubs for years and they all make my sking look perfectly beautiful , clear and healthy , even glowing . ( I get compliments on my skin all the time ) And for the price , you can use it all over not just the face.Thanks St. Ives !	1
I 've been seeing this scrub for looong time , and thanks to Amazon 's add-on program , I got this for a very low price . I did n't even know that it was for acne-prone skin , I saw the reviews and thought `` what will I loose '' . This scrub is wonderful . It smells so nice , and it leaves my skin silky . I have normal skin prone to breakouts but they are nothing like acne .	1
I do n't get it for Blackhead Control per se , I normally just get the Apricot Scrub but I could n't find it . I really do n't know the difference but it always leaves me feeling fresh and clean and helps to keep my pores clean . Great product .	1
This is good for sensitive skin , smells nice , and is not overly abrasive . Plus , it 's made in the USA - worth it for the price .	1
Let me say that I have very sensitive , dry skin on my face and this stuff works pretty well . Does n't burn like most , it definitely sloshes the dead skin away ( I just use a wash rag with it ) , and my skin is noticeably clearer after wards . No more patchy dry skin . However , the little beads in it hurt my face ! It feels like it 's scratching me as I 'm washing . I have to do it very carefully and gentle , otherwise my face would be left scratched .	1
I really like this face wash . The grainy apricot seed is a great exfoliant . My face always feels soft and clean when I use this .	1
St. Ives is good . I needed a new scrub and remember liking this brand long ago . Ca n't say it & # 34 ; controls & # 34 ; blemishes or blackheads ( then again , not too many will ) , but it does at least clean the face .	1
This product leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh . My skin looks more even , as well.It seems like if I use this two days in a row , I end up with more acne than I had before . I 'm not sure if others experience this , but it 's pretty annoying . Maybe the exfoliation beads are too rough for my skin ? I 'm not entirely sure that I have overall less acne than I had before I began using this scrub . It smells really strongly , too .	1
I bought this one instead of my usual St. Ives that is a bit more coarse and found this one worked great for my skin . Though I like both I found this is perfect for both me and my hubby who has more sensitive skin . I use this once a week and moisturize afterwards with a neutragena moisturizer with sunscreen . I feel like when I use it is makes my skin glow and it feels great . This , combined with using sunscreen , eating ( fairly ) healthy and drinking enough fluids has really helped my skin to look good and to make me feel younger . I would highly recommend . I would say my skin is not necessarily sensitive but hubby 's is and he had no issues . His skin tends to be dry/normal and mine more normal/oily and did a great job for both of us !	1
Love using this int he shower . It feels like I 'm cleaning my whole face with tiny little sand and it feels wonderful and super clean .	1
I love St Ives Apricot Scrub . I have never used a facial scrub that works better than it does in it 's price range . The price was great from Amazon and I will be ordering more .	1
I really like this stuff . My brother started on this while he was deployed and recommended it to me . One thing I miss is that minty fresh clean face feeling I get from clean and clear but it scrubs nice and feels smooth after I use it .	1
Works pretty well , but it feels like you are rubbing sand into your face . Leaves a noticeable residue in the sink after rinsing off . The smell is n't bad , and it seems to work better than other products .	1
I have been using St. Ives Apricot scrub for years ! The new design on the bottle is also pretty cool . The beads are plentiful and it provides excellent exfoliation . My face starts to peel in the winter and this gets the job done . Also leaves your skin with a nice glow .	1
My fiance has had acne since he was a teenager . He 's tried several things , to no avail , which is understandably frustrating . I have used this scrub for awhile , and I noted to him that it was actually the thing that kept my own skin nice and clear - the exfoliation helped to scrub the skin nice and clean , and the salicylic acid helped to prevent new blemishes from appearing.My fiance 's skin is noticeably clearer . He had tried a stronger salicylic acid lotion prescribed by his dermatologist , but that had some unpleasant side effects , while doing nothing to clear his skin . The only thing that has actively cut down on the amount of facial blemishes has been the apricot scrub . I ended up purchasing several new tubes of the scrub because it was now disappearing twice as fast.I 've never minded his skin issues , but it makes me happy to see him happier with his skin . It 's certainly not a miracle product , and it does n't eliminate every blemish , but the difference is certainly clear .	1
Use this daily and have for months now . I have combination skin and this is an excellent face wash for that . I 'm ordering it on subscribe and save and you ca n't beat it . This is better than a lot of the higher prices face scrubs I 've used , I 've noticed a huge difference in my face in the past few months and will continue to order this . One tube lasts at least a month or two . Such a great value ! ! !	1
This apricot scrub is good for oily and dry face skin . It cleans away dry dead skin cells and leaves the skin to breath.The oily skin it cleans very well . The finely ground apricot seeds do the scrubbing work better than any soap while being gentle to the skin	1
I 've been trying several products and thought st.ives was a simple , effective product , but it wont help my blackheads or acne . it helps a little , my skin always feels soft , its gentle on my skin , but it just doesnt do anything for me . i decided to go with X out and see if something stronger will help	1
This is a great scrub that smells good and leaves your face feeling awesome . Amazing price through Subscribe and Save !	1
I used this product for many years a long while ago . I truly am not sure why i discontinued its use , but I am very glad that I returned to it .	1
Delivered to your door for this price ? Great ! I use this stuff all the time . I shave my head , so shampoo does n't really factor in . I use small amount for my face and head and it works great !	1
I have heard many times that this is n't good for your skin because of the tiny sharp pieces used to exfoliate . However , I only use it about once every two weeks for a & # 34 ; deep cleaning & # 34 ; and am very gentle when using it . It just seems to do a much better job with the deep , penetrating exfoliation than anything else on the market that I have tried . Other brands have the round pieces which seem to just roll around on my skin instead of gripping or scraping off the dead skin . My skin does n't feel much different after using other brands .	1
I often make my own scrubs . Sugar and olive oil is a particular favorite . However , when my skin has been overwhelmed by humidity or falling asleep with a face full of make-up , I return to St. Ives Blemish and Blackhead Control Apricot Scrub . The price is definitely right , and the effectiveness of this product is legendary ! Good stuff !	1
My mom recommended I try this and so far I am impressed . I like the smell and the fact that it feels like liquid sandpaper . It does not hurt my face but the grit in it make me think it 's cleaning my pores deep down and scrubbing away the old skin .	1
This is a great exfoliating scrub for your face I live by.The smell and fragrance is excellent and the texture of the beads are GREAT for getting rid of blemishes and smoothing out your skin.Try not to use this everyday as it can damage your skin after prolonged use . I would suggest using this 2-3 times a week at the end of the day.Try for a softer and milder facewash for the morning.The cost of this item is very cheap and excellent for its worth . HIGHLY recommend both Men and Women to have this in their bathroom.Price/Value : 5/5Effectiveness/Cleaning power : 5/5Fragrance/Smell : 5/5Cleaner Skin : 100/5	1
This stuff is great . I have read mixed reviews before that say the product is too harsh for your skin , but I love it . I definitely do n't use it daily because I think that *would* be too harsh , but I love it for those days when I need a deeper clean and a nice exfoliation . It smells great and it always leaves my skin feeling great . I do n't know that I 'd recommend it to those with very sensitive skin , but it 's also really inexpensive so it may be worth a purchase just to see how your skin reacts to it .	1
I love this stuff ! I used to only use Proactiv solution , but always ran out of facial soap first . I 've found this not only to be a fine substitute , but I actually prefer it to the Practiv soap ! Makes my facial skin soft , smooth , and happy !	1
I have been using this product for years . Helps exfoliate skin without damaging . I usually purchase the larger size but purchased this size for travel .	1
Love the price and the add on I just recently started using this product and I love it one of the best I 've used and I wo n't go back to regular	1
After years of looking for something that worked for my face . I have settled on this . I grew up with acne and have always been balancing a clean face with a greasy/dry face . I 'm older now and the problems are mostly gone , but I still think this stuff is the best I 've tried .	1
I have been using this product for 10+ years and love it . It makes my skin feel soft , takes off my makeup , and the gritty texture is one that is not harsh . I wo n't use any other facial scrub -- this keeps my face clear and my skin glowing .	1
I do n't know if this product prevents blackheads or not since I do n't really have any . But I do like the product . It makes my facial skin feel very soft and smooth .	1
I have been using this for about a week , and I see a difference in my skin . I use it every other day and continue to use my normal routine for my face otherwise . It has diminished my pores and leaves my skin soft and nice . Got some for my daughter too , and she is having the same results . Will definitely be getting more .	1
year after year this is one of the best products I ever try , It just gives one a clear completion in a wink . strongly recomend it	1
I have oily skin and will be 60 next week . I use this every day and love the way it makes my skin feel smooth . I would highly recommend but not for dry skin .	1
After reading a lot in magazines about this scrub I decided to give it a try . After all , it 's so cheap that I had nothing to lose . I have been pleasantly surprised . I really like the smell and my face feels really smooth after using it . When I combine it with an electric facial brush or a face sponge it works even better . I do n't feel it has encouraged any breakouts in my acne-prone skin but I 'm careful and prefer not to use it whenever I feel my skin is breaking out .	1
Been using this product for years . Greatly cleared up my skin and makes it super smooth . Definitely highly recommended . Do n't waste money on all those expensive products .	1
I purchased two the same time . Useful for face and body . cheap enough and good enough . if i go back China , I will send it to my friends .	1
I love this stuff , it 's cheap works well . Feels good afterward , not much to say other than it does what it 's supposed to do	1
It helps to polish my leg skin . I use it one a month and it exfoliates better than any other scrubs I ever used before . And I used from both over the counter to natural expensive scrub products . this is still my Number # 1 : )	1
My son have severe acne since he was teenger.And he have tried just about everything . One of his friend recommed him to use St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub ... . After couple months using this product , his face is visibly cleaner and smooth . Now the product have become an absolute necessity in his healthy skin routine . And I have to purchase more again for him .	1
Pretty good scrub . My face def felt cleaner and smoother after . Would buy again but switching over to all natural brands now	1
I use this as a full body exfoliant , have been for years . I love the smell and feel of it and my skin smells and feels great after a shower . One of my fav products !	1
Been using this product for more than 10 years now . It 's always great to use this 2-3 times a week and not everyday . My skin is always refreshed and clean every after I use this . It 's important to exfoliate your skin regularly because the air is getting more and more polluted , and this is the cheapest way to exfoliate your skin . I 'm a guy and I 'd totally recommend this .	1
I 've tried several exfoliating scrubs over the years . Most of them significantly more expensive than St.Ives.This scrub is effective . The grains are large enough to clean out pores and exfoliate off dead skin . St. Ives also makes a sensitive skin formula , which is obviously gentler on the skin.My husband and I have oily skin and large pores . We love this scrub and use it daily . Nothing keeps pores cleaner , and the price simply can not be beat . If you do n't have oily skin you probably only want to use this 2-3 times per week.We order this through the Subscribe & Save problem so that we never run out . We even buy the travel size tubes so we do n't get clogged pores when on trips .	1
I 've spent way too much money and way too much time on other products but keep coming back to the classic Apricot Scrub . It 's cheap and works great . Leaves my skin feeling clean , clear and soft .	1
I am a guy who has been using Pro Active and several other expensive products since I was a teenage ... Yikes , that 's over 10 years now ! My Wife convinced me to at least give the St. Ives product a try so I did . As usual , I got a pimple or two while switching to the new product but my face is now clearer than ever . What I also noticed about other brands is that if I stopped using them for a couple days ( ie : road trip , business travel , etc . ) I would be ridden with Acne for weeks as a punishment ! Now with the St. Ives I do n't get that same reaction , I do n't have to worry about dry flaky skin , and its at a fraction of the cost . If this review was helpful , please give me a thumbs up : )	1
Absolutely love this scrub ! Gentle but yet deeply cleans your skin and leaves nice and smooth and even toned skin ! I will stop buying those expensive facial scrub that drys and irritates my skin .	1
I liked this scrub . I used it and it made my skin feel so soft . It did not dry me out . I am not sure how well it works on blemishes and blackheads yet . I liked the way it made my skin feel .	1
I 've been using this for years . My face is always smooth as a baby 's bottom . Works great on knees & elbows too ! I even use it on my underarms after epilating . Be sure to moisturize .	1
I use this and my other daily moisturizer as well . I love the way it cleans the skin.Has some granulation pieces in it . Just keep your eyes closed and rinse well .	1
My skin is very temperamental - it took me years and years to finally find a routine that kept my skin clear . Using this daily is an integral part of that routine . If I ever have to travel and I ca n't find a travel size bottle of this at the store , I start to break out within a couple days . It 's really good .	1
I have been using St. Ives scrub and moisturizers , they are so gentle on my skin , they lift up oil and dirt without over drying , they prevent my skin from drying , they good for acne pron skin , they smell so good .	1
I had n't used St. Ives Apricot Scrub in years because I 'd moved on to higher priced and - I assumed - better scrubs . Just tried this scrub again and I was very pleasantly surprised ! It really has changed : the scrub particles are finer than they used to be and , even though they provide fabulous exfoliation , there is nothing abrasive about this newer version . If you have n't used St. Ives Apricot Scrub in a while , I suggest you give it another try . I 'm thrilled with it and have even started using it on my legs in the shower . Love it !	1
The BEST ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! reasonable price and it works great ! ! Would recommend to both males and females . Leaves skin smooth and perfect .	1
My wife has been using this product for a long timeand has always been happy with the results she gets .	1
I have been using this product to help me recover from my scalp recover fromthe hair loss I suffered due to my iodine deficiency . This is my 2nd time ordering andin my opinion it is worth shot . I could actually start to notice baby hair sprouting around the12th day of use . But put this on your scalp when it is dry and not wet . If you wash your hair wait a full 24-30 hours before you put it in your scalp . I believe the directions say that also but I realized that pending onwhether you use a shampoo with parabens or sulfates and other ick in it you do n't want your hair tobecome taffy so Please wait 24 hrs .	1
I bought the stuff and it was working very well when I used it twice per day . I started only using it once per day and the results stopped . Just three days ago I began using it twice a day and it works very well that way . I recommend using it twice per day.I 'll continue to give updates .	1
I stocked up on this a while back . I bought about 6 containers as the price was about 6.00 or so per bottle . I am just now getting around to using it . I have been applying it to my scalp and brows ( too scared to apply to eyelashes ) twice a day.I can say that I have seen results on my eyebrows in about a week or so 's time . My eyebrows were horribly waxed in the past and the ends never grew right . They were sparse on the ends and just looked odd . But since I have been using this product they are rapidly filling in . The left one is actually getting a long tail and the right one is catching up . They are thicker , more hairs are growing in where the hair did n't grow previously , and they just getting denser.I am waiting to see how or if this works on my scalp hair . I do n't suffer from hair loss , but I do want longer hair and if this works to help it to grow faster , then I am all for it.8/22/13I have used this 2 times a day since I made the original post . I have gone through abut half the bottle . I was not totally consistent . My left brow is very thick and filled in . My right brow is coming along too . I think I have 1/4 to 1/2 and inch of growth in the front of my head all the way to my crown and then about an inch of growth from my crown to my neck . I am going to keep using it.10/18/13It works . Again I have been inconsistent , but I am on my 2nd bottle now . My brows are very dark and thick . I am afraid to wax and shape them because I am just so enamored that they grew back at all . And it does work on hair . For some reason around my face my hair grows slower maybe a 1/4- 1/2 of an inch , but from my crown to the nape I am consistently getting about a full inch a month .	1
These strips work . It instantly opens up the stuffed nasal passage and helps a lot when stuffy nose can otherwise ruin a good night 's sleep	1
I use breath strips every night , they really help me breath better . I have been buying the small/med tan ones for some time . I do not like the feeling of the clear plastic ones , and the large size is just huge . I decided to give the menthol ones a try , since they came in the sm/med size and the tan fabric style . I like them , but I do n't know that I can tell an actual difference . I think I 'll keep a box on hand for those days when I 'm really congested , like when I have a cold . In those cases perhaps it will help just a tad and make me feel better . Maybe it would just be in my head ( pun intended ! ) , but to be perfectly honest if it makes me feel better than whatever , right ?	1
I guess this is my fault for not checking , but this thing is ginormous . it is about a foot long and 3 inches wide . Huge ! If I were taking 100 pills a day , this might make sense , but I just have 2 to remember .	1
Had to start doing my parent 's meds . Nurse wants 50 bucks a pop . You can fill these and use them as a shaker when you visit the retirement home , really turns heads ! Medication anyone ?	1
I did not know it was going to be so big . It is about a foot long . each day/box can hold about 20 or so pills . I was looking for something more portable.This is a GREAT pill box . each day locks shut , they are marked clearly in BIG letters . If you are on drugs like me - it works well .	1
Each of the compartments will hold my 20 plus pills and capsules with room to spare.Day markings are easily read without my glasses.I dropped one of these the other day , did n't pop open like the kind i used to use.Because of the price , i honestly did n't expect the quality to be as good as it is.i am very satisfied with this purchase .	1
So funny when I got this , it 's huge ! ! Bigger than both hands put together . Funny , but it works so what the heck !	1
This product is well made , and is strong . The tops of each day lock-down securely , and I have had no problems with them coming open while traveling . I recommend this product , and I own three of them .	1
It 's not the best pillbox ever made I 'm sure but it does the trick and is cheap . I use this to keep track of my daily vitamins and supplements . A lot of pills easily fit into each compartment .	1
I like this a lot because it is big and if you take vitamins , supplements , etc. , you get a lot of room for them . The only reason I shaved a point off is because it 's made of clear plastic . Medications ( including vitamins ) should n't be exposed to light and the clear plastic does n't help . But other than that , it 's a pretty sweet item .	1
I wanted to comment but every one here has said it all . Huge compartments which I need for all kinds of supplements . Strong construction and unlike some reviews the compartments close securely . Now for travel the thing is so big any strong movement of the bag can open it . I would run Scotch tape over it and yes if your pills are sensitive to light you need to keep this box in a draw . I 'm not going to give it less than five stars because these drawbacks do n't effect me and I have had a lot of trouble finding a pill box that would hold my supplements . Oh yes its size and the reason you bought this thing may annoy you some if space is a problem in your overnight bag .	1
These are humongous , my 5 pills take up less than 20 % of the box . Better big than small I suppose . They should have made it tinted so that it can be left out without fear of light degrading the pills inside . They can just leave the bottom clear to see whether there are still pills in there . Just a thought .	1
3XL size because I am on a lot of different medications and these have room left over . I am so glad EZY Dose came out with these huge pill minders .	1
I take a lot of supplements . In fact , I am personally responsible for the `` vitamin and supplement industry bailout program '' ( Mr. President , you can thank me later ) . Anyway , I have never found a pill container that would hold all my supplements . I have the size smaller than this one and I would try cramming everything in there and praying the lid would close ( and stay closed ) . The 3XL size is PERFECT ! My only regret is that I did n't buy 3 or 4 more .	1
Huge pill box . I take a lot of pills , so good for me and my friend . She cried when I gave it to her .	1
I like the size . The latches have held tight up until now . It has plenty of room for my pills and vitamins .	1
GOOD value for the cost . If you use a lot of pills daily this is for you . Hope this helps . Thank you.Blessings , Phil	1
These are exactly what I was looking for ! They are not the locking kind , which is good . I find the locking kind to be quite difficult to open ! I accidentally bought that kind first and then came back and purchased this listed product . They are very large ( the largest I 've seen ) and so all of those giant liquid type capsules fit in nicely .	1
I have pills I have to take in the morning and some at night . I 've been using some 2X boxes that my retired-nurse wife got from drug reps at the clinic.The problem is that they were too small . My vitamin , Glucosimine-Condroitin , Fish Oil , Welchol and Co-Q10 capsules are all huge . Just those five things add up to nine capsules in the morning batch and five in the evening . Then add in my aspirin , BP meds , Lexapro , Plavix , Niaspan a few others ... Anyway , everything is solved with these 3X containers.One holds all my morning meds for a week with room to spare . Yes , even with nine large capsules . The other holds my evening meds with LOTS of room left over.The only thing I wish is that I could have gotten one in a different color or perhaps tinted a bit darker to make it REALLY obvious which held my nighttime meds .	1
I take a lot of vitamins and suppliments and this holds them all for easy daily dosage . Each compartment is large and all the lids snap tightly closed . I just ordered a second one for our 2-week vacation this summer .	1
I bought this for my Dad . He can easily see the very large letters , and the case is big enough for him to grasp . Does what it is intended to do .	1
Too small for all of my vitamin supplements plus I use these for my dog 's supplements . The employee ( denise ) was very kind n refunded me my money after I returned them	1
Some people have complained about the size ( either too large . . . or too small ) . . .but no one has posted a picture , so I just did . If you take quite a few medications . . . or supplements.. . . or both . . . then this pillbox might be for you . I actually have two of them . . one for AM and one for PM . They are easy to open . . . I like that they are clear so you can see if you have left anything inside . . . the lids stay shut . . . I 've had one for several years , and it 's still going strong . . . I really ca n't think of anything bad to say about them . They also have braille in the corner of the lid .	1
This is perfect if you take a large amount of supplements or medicines . I use it because I refuse to go on a statin and I need to take about 6 different supplements for Cholesterol . This makes it very easy to keep track of what I am taking and holds all the pills easily . Each cube is approximately 2 & # 34 ; x1 & # 34 ; x1 & # 34 ; to give some perspective .	1
This pill box is does what it should . It opens easily , snaps shut securely and holds your pills . It 's solid and labeled for the days of the week in an easy-to-read way . But be warned , it 's jumbo just like it says in the description so depending on your needs it might actually be too big . You can get at least 6 horse pills into each section or about 50 little ones . Whatever your pill needs are this container should be big enough . The container itself is quite long so take that into consideration if you plan to carry it around . If you 're looking for a smaller pill reminder I recommend the Apothecary 7 day 7 Sided Medium Pill Reminder .	1
First I 'd like to acknowledge that I realize , or I discovered from trial and error , that pill cases are something that should be chosen by the person who will be filling them and administering the medicine/pills , because there are numerous different kinds , sizes , and styles and each one is good for different reasons . It 's a very personal item , and everyone will like or hate certain types for their own , very good reasons.This review is for the 3XL but the general features and quality of the product should hold true to any size of this exact design ( EZY Dose brand XL , 2XL , 3XL ) .SHORT & SWEET REVIEW - If you want the short & sweet version of my review , know that I chose this one because it was easy to fill , easy to handle , easy to dispense , had the number of days I wanted , was the size I needed in overall dimensions as well as the size of each compartment , is stackable , and it did not pop open when it should not . If you want a more in depth review , see below.FULL REVIEWI purchased the EZY Dose 3XL for $ 4.29 in 2011 and I 'm very happy I did . I rarely recommend something that 's a bit more expensive . I only do if the item is much better in quality than cheaper ones and therefore worth the extra money . I purchased others that were cheaper , and had to return them . The biggest problems I had with other designs were the compartments popping open when moved or if something accidently touched it , ease of opening and closing compartments , ease of dispensing ( pouring out the contents ) , and size ( holding enough pills ) . > DIMENSIONS OF THE 3XL SIZE : To give you an idea of how many pills the EZY Dose 3XL will hold - I measured it by filling one compartment with water and found it holds 2 fluid ounces ( 2/3 of a 3 oz bathroom Dixie cup ) . So , to know if your pills will all fit , put your pills in a 3 oz Dixie cup and if your pills do n't fill up the cup more than 2/3 , you should have no problem . That 's the easiest way to know , if you ca n't test it first ( when you buy online ) . See below for exact dimensions of the 3XL . See our photo above for a comparison with two other pill organizers.The total outer dimensions are 11 '' long , 2 5/16 '' deep ( including levers and hinges ) , 1 5/16 '' tall ( including the little brail nodes ) .The inner dimensions of each compartment are 1.5 '' wide , 2 1/16 '' deep ( front to back ) , and just under 1 /18 '' tall ( bottom to top ) . And again , as I mentioned above , the volume is 2 oz liquid measure . But of course you do not want to put liquids in it , that 's just to give you an idea of the size of the compartment . I put 22 pills of various sizes in one compartment and it 's only 3/4 full . I wanted it to be this large because I might have more pills to take in the future and wanted the `` room to grow '' , plus if you try to stuff too many into any case you can make it pop open just by over loading it , stuffing it too full . I can easily put another 10 to 15 pills in the EZY Dose 3XL ( for a total of nearly 40 pills ) without any problem.POST NOTE 4-8-13 , REGARDING SIZE : Today I noticed this ad no longer gives the choice of the 3XL size but only offers the `` Jumbo '' and `` 2XL '' sizes . However , the 2XL is currently described in this ad as approximately 9 '' L x 2 '' W x 1 '' D in size and the `` Jumbo '' is currently described as being approximately 11 '' L x 2.4 '' Wx 1 '' D. If this is true it would mean the `` Jumbo '' is larger than the `` 2XL '' and nearly the same size as the 3XL I have . So that means either the `` Jumbo '' described here is in fact the 3XL size or the description of the `` Jumbo '' here is incorrect . Either way , for this ad , I highly recommend you contact the seller first to confirm the outer dimensions of the product you order. > SECURE , STAYS CLOSED , EASY OPEN : I had purchased other pill organizers but they were smaller and none of the other simple basic holders I tested held the pills securely and simply , without popping open , without having to fumble with special levers ( I 'm referring to the plain style , not the lockable , which can be confusing on Amazon since some photos are incorrect ) , without the extra space special levers and markers took up . I wanted simple , compact but large ( but only 7 days ) , and secure , and that 's what I got with this EZ Dose 3XL design.I placed this in my larger bag ( purse ) in a realistic walk from my home to my car and shopping all day and had no problem with it popping open . I also tossed it and dropped it onto my counter several times ( with and without pills in it ) and it never popped open like others did . But I do not recommend tossing this ( or any product like it ) loosely , without care , into any bag . It 's not made for that . It 's made for sitting on a counter , a table , or in a drawer . Personally , if I knew I was going to bring it with me in a bag ( purse ) every day I 'd slide it into an umbrella cover , just to be sure . I have several umbrella covers with no use , since I never put them back on my umbrellas once I take it off the first time so I 'm happy to find a great use for them anyway. > STACKABLE : Another great feature that I noticed only after I bought it is the tiny nodes on the bottom ( at the corners ) which fit into tiny holes in the top of another , making more than one securely stackable on top of each other . I was surprised to find this feature since the nodes and matching holes that allow secure stacking are barely noticeable . I found them by accident . But when I realized I could securely stack these I loved them even more. > HAS BRAILLE MARKINGS which are easy to read ( feel ) . > THIS DESIGN IS RECOMMENDED , EVEN IF MONTHLY PILL ORGANIZING IS NEEDED : Lastly , for those of you who hate the boring and tedious chore of preparing pills every day like I do , and want to use a pill organizer that has many more compartments , I do NOT recommend the kind with a sliding plastic lid like thisEzy Dose Four-a-day Weekly Maxi-pharmadose Medication Organizeror thisEZY Dose Four-A-Day Weekly Practidose Medication Organizer . I have one like this , and it 's very difficult ( especially if you have dexterity problems ) to pour the pills out and not have them end up all over the counter or floor . It 's just very awkward to pour them out . If you insist on using a larger pill organizer that holds more than 7 days or has more than 7 compartments , make sure the organizer allows you to remove one row or one compartment at a time from the entire case . It should lift out , so you can easily open the compartment and pour the pills out into your hand ( or a cup for a patient ) , similar to this one : Ezy Dose Large Four a Day Weekly , One Day At a Time Medication Organizer . But after using this 3XL EZY Dose dispenser every day for over a year , as well as smaller ones for other purposes , I can say I still love the 3XL EZY Dose dispenser and recommend it even for those who want to prepare a month or more of pills in advance . Since they are securely stackable ( and do n't pop open if it does topple over ) I recommend buying as many as you need and stacking up to 3 or 4 high - much better than any other monthly system I 've found . Unfortunately as of today 's date the 3XL is no longer available through this exact listing but I 'm hoping to find it elsewhere on Amazon since this design and the 3XL size is so hard to find in any local store ( and I looked in several states during trips ) ... .. Just found this , it appears to be what I bought at about the same price : JUMBO 7 Day Pill Box- 2 pack~As I mentioned above , I was looking for a very simple , easy to read , easy to open , easy to handle , clear , 7 day pill case that would hold a large amount of pills and hold them securely , without popping open . This was the largest and best I found that held 7 days . I looked online and in stores in my area . I did not buy my first 2 from Amazon , but now that I know they have them at a reasonable price that I can afford , I 'll be buying more because I find preparing my daily pills to be boring , annoying , and monotonous and I want to be able to prepare 4 to 8 weeks of pills at one time , so I 'll be buying at least 4 to 6 more through Amazon this time ( so I do n't have to drive to the one store I finally found that carries this ) . I have Amazon Prime free shipping privileges , so that 's a plus too . If you want to know how to get Amazon Prime free shipping , just ask me.Highly recommended if you want secure function along with a simple , clear , easy open , large , nothing busy looking , fancy or complicated design . But as I mentioned above , I highly recommend , before making your purchase , that you look closely at the many different kinds of pill organizers there are available to you here at Amazon and in your local stores , and make sure you get the one that 's best for you . You have many choices , which is rare these days.Wishing you all Good Health , Happiness , and Prosperity	1
This is a great way to keep track of your vitamins and meds if you only take them once a day .	1
I always have heartburn after a spicy meal . Unfortunately , I lived in Mexico for a number of years , and it caught up to me . I have ulcers , and terrible about taking care of them . Nonetheless , Pepcid AC gets me through the meal & through the night . No waking up with caffeine burns & or too much hot sauce burns . I like what I drink & I like what I eat & as unhealthy as that may be at times , Pepcid AC is there for me ... .and she does n't judge me either ; ) GOOD BUY !	1
My cat and I both take Pepcid so it can get a bit costly . This was a large size at a great price and it came really quickly .	1
Do n't know why but the wonderful one with whom I share bed and board always has a negative reaction ( translation : annoying gas and indigestion ) to stuffing . ( Not stuffing himself at a meal but stuffing as in dressing ) Does n't matter whether the stuffing is in a turkey ( his favorite ) or pork chops or simply served dressing.He 's found that taking one of these tablets up to 30 minutes before eating solves all of those problems . Now , he 's happy enjoying his stuffing while stuffing .	1
Works great when taken twice daily about 12 hours apart , to prevent heartburn . I have been using this product since the 1980 's when it was first available in prescription form . Little , if any , side effects	1
A ER nurse told me that when someone comes in with bee stings and a reaction , they give Benadryl ( diphenhydramine ) 25 - 50 mg and Pepcid AC ( famotidine ) 10 mg. to counteract the venom . Evidently Pepcid AC is an H2 blocker ( anti-histamine ) that works with Benadryl ( an H1 blocker ) to keep the swelling and inflammation to a minimum , reducing allergic reactions.Here in North Carolina , we have lots of hornets and wasps , and also the dreaded fire ant . I keep a bottle of Benadryl tablets and now a bottle of Pepcid AC tablets in a kitchen drawer for easy access when someone comes in with multiple bites or stings . Anyone who has stepped in a fire ant nest will know how fast the victim swells up , and how dangerous multiple stings can be . Of course anyone who is allergic to bee stings , or who reacts badly to insect bites should seek medical help and NOT rely on home treatment of any kind . But for mild reactions and general discomfort , a dose of both Pepcid AC and Benadryl will help reduce the swelling.Pepcid AC also works really well as an antacid , without requiring days of treatment the way Nexium or Prevacid do . For occasional heartburn or acid reflux , Pepcid AC is an effective , fast acting product . Our home medicine chest wo n't be without it !	1
Our veterinarian put our cat on Pepcid for digestive disorders and it has really worked well . Talk to your vet about dosing information if your pet is suffering with digestive vomiting , etc .	1
I got this for my dog to keep her from being sick . She has cancer , and was throwing up a lot , and the vet said to try this , and it really helped ! !	1
Take this pill and it takes away your acid reflux within 10 minutes and is effective for 12-24 hours . Now they need to come up with a permanent fix !	1
I 'm taking NSAID therapy for my arthritis and was required to take medication to protect my stomach . Initially I tried Nexium which unfortunately I had uncomfortable side effects while taking it . So I spoke to my pharmacist who had a complete list of all the various prescriptions I as an older person have to take , she recommended Pepcid AC 20 mg saying it would have the fewest interactions with the other medicines I was taking . I went online to find the most reasonable price as usual ended up on Amazon and so far so good ... my tummy is fine , no heartburn and no side effects . While I have no way of knowing if this would be true for other people I know it was a real Godsend for me . The price is right , the delivery was really quick and Pepcid AC has worked just great .	1
I am unable to find this count of Pepcid at stores in my area . I was so excited to be able to find this on Amazon and at this price too !	1
I would definitely buy these again . If you are looking for something to help you keep of with the alkalinity of your body these will definitely help you .	1
When you first wake up , trying to get that first urinalysis . Also `` pissed off '' the first few times I tried using . : D	1
Hands down the best razors fro shaving my legs . And the price can not be beat . Have this on my subscribe & save !	1
I found this product through the Amazon subscribe and save program . It is now the only razor that my husband will use . His skin is very sensitive , so most razors cause nicks , cuts , scrapes and rashes . He has none of these problems using this razor . On occasion he will nick himself , but that is usually because he 's in a hurry ! I will continue to buy this razor for as long as Amazon has it at such a good price . They are much more expensive at my local stores .	1
I wear a nicely beard and love Schick Xtreme dispo razors for keeping a well-groomed appearance -- and these offer a comfortable shave even when used dry ( as I do ) . They stay comfortable for 4-5 uses this way , with no skin irritation !	1
Good razors , one of the best disposables around . Nice sized package and worth the cost . Good shave , clean and low drag . Very comfortable .	1
I 've tried every razor on the market ( for reasons even I ca n't explain ) and have come to the conclusion that this razor is & # 34 ; the best & # 34 ; for the following reasons:1 . The shave is clean and long-lasting2 . The chance for nicks is much less than most3 . The razor head is wide , which provides stability and reduces shaving time4 . The price is far less than the insanely-priced Gillette Fusion , which in my experience has some -- but not enough - benefits to justify its lofty cost.5 . These razors can be purchased at very low prices not just a Amazon but at CVS and no doubt other retailers using a coupon or watching for a discount.6 . Note : This razor has a better feel than the cartridge version , which is heavier and unbalanced.In short , Schick finally got it right , eliminating the need to line Gillette 's pockets .	1
I got these on the subscription which makes them affordable . Gives me a good shave , has a lubricating edge that works fine for me .I like these for traveling or the gym , very light and easy to handle . I personally get a good week and a half of shaves out of each one .	1
These razors work great on my scalp . I use them about three or four times before tossing them , but I use them on my head and my beard since my hair on the top of my head is getting thinner by the day . They offer the closest shave I 've had on the top of my noggin since I 've been shaving my noggin ( about two years ) . My only complaint is that my neck is rather sensitive , and this particular razor does n't handle my neck so well . So , I 'd recommend it more for shaving your head than your beard if you 're a tender , rugged man like myself , heh , heh.In short , it 's a pretty good razor that definitely has my vote when considering my scalp . For my beard , I 'm still on the lookout for a better blade .	1
i love the flexible blades for shaving my legs and armpits . no knicks , ever . i tend to find that men 's blades last longer than women 's blades so I buy men 's products . if the blade lasted longer than 2 weeks against my not heavy female leg hair I would give it 5 stars but 2 weeks with one razor is pretty good .	1
I love these . Why pay more for fancy razors when these are awesome . I have medium thick facial hair and I get about 10 shaves out of one of these before I have to toss them . I do not shave every day so a pack of these last me about 90 days	1
These are the best disposable razors I ever had.I grabbed a new one at the gym a while back , and the thing ran for a month of p/t shaving ! ! A great shave & a GREAT deal here on Amazon ! !	1
These work pretty good for close shaves . I believe I have gotten a bit cleaner shaves from Gilette , but this is good enough for the price , so I can recommend them with a clear conscience .	1
So many baldies go with the Mach 3 ... this one bends in conformity to the curves of your head AND is disposable ! I can get 2 or 3 uses out of one razor before disposing .	1
I first discovered these when they gave them away for free with the Skintimate shave gels . To my horror , I suddenly find they have discontinued the freebies.So , I had to go looking for this particular razor , because this is the only one I 've used that leaves my legs nick free and very smooth . In combination with the Skintimate shave gel , I 'm happy ! I mean , it is important not to bleed to death in the shower.I 've also purchased these in a pretty mauve which is somuch more feminine . It does seem it is the exact same tripleblade razor.If you take one of these razors and `` while the cover is still in place '' you press down on the top , you will see that the blade is very flexible and it also tilts back and forth . Also has a nice moisturizing strip to allow the blade to slide gently across your most sensitive skin.Evolutionary performance ? YESBlades that do n't clog and rinse easily ? YESEasy-to-remove Blade Cover ? YESLightweight and hand-friendly handle ? YESI think you will be equally impressed.~The Rebecca Review	1
ONE STAR : The Maxell LR44 10-pack photo shows the new hologram packaging , but I received the old orange & black packaging.The batteries are stale . Lights powered by them are semi-bright , and only last a day or so.The orange & black pack rates 1-star.FIVE STARS : From the same supplier , MyBatterySupplier , I ordered the50-pack , which did come in the new hologram package , and the difference was dramatic . Lights powered by the batteries were brilliant , and I expect them to last much longer.The new hologram pack rates 5-stars .	-1
These did not work at all - absent of enough power to work . these were cheap - waste of money	-1
I bought a pack of these a while back from Sam 's Club . I used them in my appliance remotes but noticed that they do n't hold their charges for long thereby necessitating frequent recharges . The cheap rapid charger 'CH30MN ' that came with the battery pack did not help matters either as it heats the batteries up during the charging process to the point of being unbearable to touch.Save your money and buy the newSANYO NEW 1500 eneloop 8 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteriesinstead .	-1
As much as I want to be greener , I find that these batteries make me want to buy regular old batteries . Definitely do your research and stay away from these .	-1
The AAAs I have in my remote controls seem to last a very long time on one or two charges ; of course the power-draw of a remote control is minimal . In contrast , I have had many problems with Energizer AAs used in digital cameras . While some of these batteries keep the Energizer Bunny going and going , for no discernible reason , many of them start showing as `` bad '' in the charger ( blinking red light ) after only a few charges , meaning ... pregnant pause ... the rabbit died . *Update , 27 FEB 2012* I am still using 4 of these batteries ( of the 16 that I bought ) , and while they continue to limp along , the Rayovac Hybrids that I bought at the same time are by far superior ... The Energizers power my camera for only a few hours , whereas the Rayovacs that I bought at the same time are still good for several days of camera use.Day and night . Even if the Energizers were being sold for $ .25 each , I do n't think I 'd go there again .	-1
I 've had a set of these batteries for a year or two now . The last few times I 've taken them out for vacation use in camera , I 've had the same problem : I charge two sets ( one Kodak and one these Energizers ) when I put the camera away . A few weeks later , I go off on vacation . The Kodak 1600mAh set will last me all day on the charge from a month or so before . The Energizer 2500mAh set might last me half a day , having lost most of its charge from sitting for the same number weeks before use.After missing out on some pics on my latest trip due to dead batteries , I 'd had enough . The Energizers are going in the bin , and I just followed the good reviews to buy a set of Duracells to replace them .	-1
Plain and simple , they do not work . They do not charge . I exchanged them for a second set , and they had the same problem . I will stick with the Duracell rechargables that have worked perfectly for me so far .	-1
Usually my rechargeable batteries last longer the year before I need to buy a new set . Not this time . Maybe I just got a bad batch	-1
I have 4 kids and we were using batteries like crazy . I do n't necessarily like throwing all of those batteries away when there are rechargables . I went to the store without doing any research first and just picked up these Energizers 2500mAhs . Needless to say , most do n't work after a year . I could n't get my programmable thermastat to even work because it had such a low charge coming straight off of the charger . And today , my sons batteries died in his guitar , took the ones that had just gotten done in the charger and they did n't even last five minutes , and boy he was n't very happy . I think I would have been better off getting those junky ones from the dollar store . Look for a better brand !	-1
This product is advertised as the NEW Energizer Rechargeable NiMH AA Batteries . But once you received it , you may be shocked to find out that : the rated capacity of those NEW batteries is just '2300mAh ' , lower than the previous generation of '2500mAh ' Energizer NiMH cells . So are you really getting a new and improved product , or just some old inventory from many years ago ? The fact is , Energizer has discontinued the '2500mAh ' series of rechargeable AA NiMH cells , presumably due to massive complaints about rapid-self-discharge problem . All new Energizer rechargeable AA cells on the market now are rated '2300mAh'.I have tested four of those new cells , using the Discharge/Refresh function of myLa Crosse BC-900charger/analyzer . Here are my findings : - Fresh out of the package , those cells hold an average of 330mAh , or just 14 % of the full capacity.- After fully charging them for the first time , they hold an average of 1040mAh.- After two more discharge/charge cycles , the average capacity improved to 2340mAhBased on the above observations , I can conclude that those 'New ' Energizer cells are just ordinary NiMH cells with lower capacity . They are not the LSD ( low-self-discharge ) type pioneered bySANYO eneloop . This is very disappointing , because other name-brand battery makers have already introduced LSD products similar to eneloop , such as theRayovac HybridandDuracell Pre Charged . In contrast , the Energizer Bunny simply 'rolled back ' its battery technology to circa 2004.The only positive thing I can say about those 2300mAh Energizer cells is : they _probably_ do n't self-discharge as badly as previous generation of 2500mAh cells.In summary , those so-called 'New ' Energizer NiMH cells have capacity just slightly higher than LSD NiMH cells ( 2000-2100mAh ) , yet do not offer the advantage of lower self discharge rate . As of this writing , this product is priced at nearly 2x higher than LSD cells . So it is just a bad deal .	-1
As many other reviewers have pointed out , these batteries have a very high self-discharge rate . This means that within a short period of time ( for me about 7-10 days ) they will be completely dead even if you completely charged them and never used them . The only reason I did n't give these batteries 1 star is because they do work well right out of the charger . But you pretty much have to use them within 2-3 days of charging . Wait any longer and it will already be significantly discharged . I know I did n't just get a bad batch either because I have a couple dozen of these Energizers which I purchased over the course of 2+ years . I did n't notice the discharge rate at first because I used to charge my batteries pretty frequently to make sure I always had a fresh set in whatever device I was using . But eventually I started noticing that even my `` freshly charged '' batteries were n't lasting very long . So I started paying closer attention to how frequently I charged my batteries and realized that even after a week they would be mostly or completely dead.I 've switched over to Rayovac Hybrids and Sanyo Eneloops which both have a much lower self-discharge . I 've very happy with both of them and would definitely recommend either of them over these Energizers . I hope that Energizer eventually comes out with some low self-discharge batteries because I really like their other batteries . But avoid the rechargeables . They 're just not worth it .	-1
I used NiCD batteries for a time years ago and gave up on those . When I tried the NiMH batteries I started with these ones and was very disappointed with the technology , we used it in a mouse that required about twice a week changes , later I changed to Sanyo 's eneloop and I 'm very happy .	-1
Avoid these batteries ! ! ! ! ! ! My experience is similar to many others . Good initial performance , and then these bloody Energizer batteries ca n't hold a charge . Unfortunately before I discovered how crappy they really are , I bought a bunch of them , for use in my digital cameras and camera flash units . When these babies fail , performance falls like a lead balloon . They might have enough power to operate a remote control unit , but you can forget about powering anything with a major power draw.Unfortunately Energizer is extremely successful at getting stores to stock this junk . I get real annoyed whenever I see them on display , because it reminds me of all the money I wasted . They seem to be available everywhere , a constant reminder of a disaster . How does a product that is so bad , get such great distribution and remain available for sale ? Energizer probably gets off easy , because it takes a while for their batteries to go bad . By then , it 's less likely that people will complain or return them . Blasting them here is like therapy for me.As an alternative , I strongly recommend Ray-O-Vac Hybrid cells , which have worked very well for me so far .	-1
While these batteries have a higher mAh rating than other brands , I 've seen much better performance from my Duracell and even some generic rechargeable batteries . I can not say for certain you 'll have the same bad experience , as it depends what you use them for , but for me they barely seem to make it 2-3 months and sometimes only weeks before they lose too much charge to be of use . They 're nearly worthless to me . I almost never use them anymore.I 'm replacing these with Duracell ones that are advertised to hold their charge for a year , so hopefully those will work as promised . I just can not advise going with Energizer after using these . Try another brand .	-1
I had this Interplak until for just over 1 year and it just stopped working for no apparent reason . The pump runs but no water flows . I checked the water path and it 's completely clear . No blockages anywhere . The pump simply does n't pump water anymore . I would n't get another because even when it did work the water jet was underpowered . The WaterPik brand has a more robust stream and is more effective . As other reviewers have pointed out , the pressure dial on the Interplak can be almost impossible to turn . There is a large array of attachments will for most people will simply be a cleaning nightmare since they 'll never use them . So they just sit on top of the unit collecting dirt . Overall I 'd rate this unit as `` build quality : poor , life span : short , effectiveness : disappointing '' .	-1
The ad shows batteries in a package , I got batteries that were shrink wrapped and no open to leave seller feedback . I just got a bunch of loose batteries . I do n't know if they are real Duracell or not .	-1
Best Deals sells outdated batteries . All the batteries had an expiration date of 09/2011 on them . Also they were not in Duracell packaging as the website picture shows . Makes one wonder if they bought a huge bunch of outdated batteries and are now trying to rip off buyers . Best Deals has a history of doing this if you read back in feedback on this company . Whish I had read back and I would n't have ordered from them . They also never replied to my emails . I filed an A-Z guarantee claim with Amazon . Amazon has also referred this seller to their investigation unit . It is a shame a seller like this tarnishes the excellant reputation Amazon has . No wonder the batteries were so cheap .	-1
These were described as guaranteed for 5 years , but have an expiration date that is only 3 years ( Mar 2016 ) . Since I am using them for battery back-up in clocks this is a real bummer . Not what I expect from Amazon . Will probably live with it rather than mess with a return .	-1
Item did not arrive on a cardboard card , it arrived in an easy to open plastic case and with the expiration date only 3 years out . Fresh batteries have a 5 year expiration date . The description and the picture of this item needs to be changed if they are going to sell Amazon customers a different and older item . They were nice and sent me a return label free of charge .	-1
Ignore the positive reviews for these batteries folks . Better you should trust the negative comments and save yourself the hassle of returning dead batteries . I should have known when they arrived that something was wrong : They were shipped in a generic clamshell-type package with no label or indication they were made by Duracell - not at all as pictured and a red flag for fakes . Note to seller : How long did you think you 'd get away with selling dead ( and possibly fake ) batteries ? Note to Amazon : Please investigate this seller !	-1
I did n't order these because so many things seemed fishy about their presentation on Amazon . The Duracell photos were all different -- none of them D batteries in a package of eight . On the product description page , it looked like AA batteries were shown in the image . When I read reviews , many buyers received their batteries unpackaged , just thrown in a box . Others received them in individual bags . A few years ago , I discovered that rip-off batteries are commonly sold on the internet -- not the brands they say they are , but fakes.SOOO ... no thanks . I 'll go with Ray-O-Vac this time .	-1
I play my radio 8-10 hours a day and thought I would buy Duracell , even though they are more expensive then the energizer batteries . These last no longer than the energizer , so no use in spending the extra money , they just are n't worth it .	-1
Had Chinese symbols on the bottom and Euro warning on the side . Ca n't find any in the USA with these markings . Avoid-you 're not really saving any money-you 're just throwing away what you pay . Would you trust your family to these in your smoke detector-I would n't ! ! !	-1
maglite used to be the standard for good flashlites . not anymore . this one has poor illumination and uses batteries like there 's no tomorrow . The battery cap does n't want to thread back on . And it should have a toggle instead of a screw on/off switch . and there 's no replacement bulb . and several times when the batteries have been replaced the bulb blew out and they 're difficult to find . a piece of S*** !	-1
I bought this flashlight after seeing all the advertising for Maglite . What a disappointment ! It is small and puts out maybe 20 lumens of light , if that . The lumens are so low that Maglite never even lists the lumens on any of its products , unlike its competitors.This thing might make a decent booklight but that is not what I bought it for . For the same price at this over-hyped , underperformer I could get a flashlight 5x as powerful !	-1
This flashlight looks and feels great but it runs down batteries immediately . Now my rarely used Maglite ca n't be opened to replace the battery - I suspect the battery leaked and glued the compartment shut . In any event , it 's dead after a very short life . Do n't buy	-1
I 'm clueless as to whom these trashbags are marketed . I bought them and find them pretty annoying . For one thing they DO NOT 'stretch and grab ' as the marketing info says . They just hang there . If you want grabbing , try Hefties & # 34 ; Hefty Gripper Tall , 13 Gallon Kitchen Bags ) . They 're awesome.The other thing Easy-Flaps do n't do is hold as much garbage as other Tall Kitchen bags . Because of their construction they barely fit our can , plus unless you under-fill them , there is not way to tie them off.The only good point about these bags is that they are 1 mil plastic . Otherwise they fall far short of what 's needed in the kitchen .	-1
Not very sturdy . Bristles are too soft . Only lasted about a month before I wanted to get a new one .	-1
Generally , I have many positive experiences on Amazon with the exception of this vendor . Please let me explain ; I received these batteries and noticed that they had an expiration date of 2027 . Wow ! I was `` pleasantly surprised '' for the long shelf life . I then placed the batteries in my drive way alarm and noticed that my drive-way alarm did not work properly . I immediately thought that I had a defective drive-way alarm . However , I decided to check the volts of these batteries with my multimeter and was quickly surprised that 5 batteries out of 8 were defective and actually was only producing less that 1 volt . They should be 1.5 volts . After contacting the vendor , they had me send the batteries back for testing which I had to pay for . Since then , I have not heard hide nor hair from this company . They will not communicate with me . That 's wrong ! Do yourself a favor and purchase these somewhere else ... .	-1
Supposed to last 6 to 8 times longer than alkaline or rechargeables and produce 600+ pictures on a digital camera . Took between 20 and 25 pictures . Next day , camera turned on , flashed low batteries , and died . Eveready wants the batteries for testing . Seems to me , they have already been tested . MJR	-1
Amazon lists these batteries under rechargeable AA batteries . They are NOT , repeat NOT rechargeable . I would not have ordered them for the application I purchased ( underwater strobe for week 's diving ) if Amazon had not incorrectly listed them .	-1
I used to love these Energizer AA Lithium Batteries . No more . The life of the battery is far too short compared to the ones I have bought in the past .	-1
i was uneducated in lithium batteries . i thought they were rechargeable . but have come to get info from energizer via their telephone rep..that only lithium ion batteries are rechargeable ... that lithium batteries as these are NOT.to me then , the price value is just not there . for the price paid for these i can buy around 36 good alkaline cells.update : i have found these batteries to not last as long as regular alkaline batteries ... .e.g . i get about 6 months use on a clock from an alkaline but only two months on these lithiums ... .obviously then i will stick with alkaline over these ... .i have tho moved to using rechargeable cells for nearly everything anymore- usually the enelop from sanyo- these are very good and certainly cost effective ...	-1
My old brush got all smashed together and had this sort of bald spot in the middle and could no longer reach a spot in the bottom of my coffee cup , so I bought this one . I wanted to like it , but it 's so soft that it does n't really scrub the spot on my coffee cup either .	-1
Great design , very poor execution . The bristles are so soft that the brush deforms if you leave it in the sink . Does n't clean my stainless coffee carafe thoroughly .	-1
I 'm not sure why this has such good reviews . It works decently for the sides of the bottle but the top bristles quickly flatten and it does not get the bottom of bottles clean . I would spend more money for a better brush .	-1
I was expecting something a little firmer to really scrub out the gunge in my water bottle . This only works if I use it while things are still 'fresh ' .	-1
Very disappointed in this product . The bristles are too soft to really clean grout and the shape of the head is n't optimal for that purpose either .	-1
I have stuff I needed to scrub really hard to get clean . The bristles on this brush bend and fold over . They are long and just do n't feel like I can get any muscle behind my scrubs .	-1
The box contains a large warning : This product contains/may contain a chemical known to cause cancer , birth defects or other reproductive harm . Now , why would I want to wash my clothes with a product that contains such a chemical ? Of course it 's being returned.Secondarily , the box states `` Made in USA '' , while the plastic wrapper inside says `` Made in China '' . They do n't even know where it 's made .	-1
I received this battery in the proper packaging just as the picture depicts but the battery was just as dead as the one I was trying to replace . Yes , I can return it for refund but after Ive paid the shipping to send it back I 'm hardly better off . I should have just gone to radio shack in the first place.Ive bought bateries three times on amazon ( two different sellers ) and they have always been useless.Lesson learned .	-1
Strange - the pack was definitely unopened , but one of the cells was pretty dead.Too much hassle to return , so I 'll just accept that I got one expensive battery .	-1
I had used Duracell previously in Mail Chime ( ASIN B00103FDDU ) and been very satisfied with the life and the simple and plain date code / expiration date on the Duracell . I have to change out the Duracell twice a year , so I thought I 'd see if the Energizer had a longer life . These Energizer only lasted a few days before failure . They were new and sealed in package with Use by date of September 2015 . Based on Duracells having expiration dates about 3-4 years out , I thought this was odd and contacted Energizer . Energizer indicated the A23 batteries have a 3 year shelf life and that my package was made in December 2012 , would expire in December 2015 and should be used by September 2015 . I wish they would print something like that or more consumer friendly on the package . So my batteries were reasonably fresh and I do n't know why they failed so quickly . Switched back to the Duracell version and they work fine , so I 'm sticking with them for my application . Both the Energizer and Duracell batteries came from the same Amazon merchant .	-1
There was no good till date on my packaging . This was taken off a strip of batteries not what is posted . No date on package . Does it expire 2013 ?	-1
Steel wool replacement my butt . You can go to the fish store and buy the filter pads that come in like a 1 ' X 1 ' sheet and cut your self up 6 of them .	-1
I purchased this because several reviews said that this comes with a prepaid label to dispose of the old battery . It does not . If I had known that , I would have paid a couple extra dollars and bought an original equipment battery from APC rather than this third-party knockoff .	-1
Said it would work for the shaver my husband has and did n't . Just through it in the trash . For the price of the heads one can almost buy a new shaver . So that is what I will continue to do without any compaints from my husband that we should be buying heads . Wrong .	-1
I called Norelco and was told this was the head for one of my husbands shavers . It was not , so it was a waste of money to buy these . I have returned them but have postage expenses .	-1

Do you have migraines or Meniere 's disease or just have a sensitive head ? Do n't get any of the pulsating Oral B brushes . They will just make you nauseous or trigger a headache.I have used the classic Oral B electric brush for many years . A fantastic simple white design by Braun of Germany - since discontinued after Braun was bought by an American company . Now I have the simple low end non pulsing model . Essentially the same guts and head as the classic but with an ugly , over stylized , blue body.When the battery started to die on my classic model , I picked up a pulsating Oral B . It is really banging away at your teeth and does as good a job as the non pulsatinging . But it vibrates your jaw and skull like , well , a vibrating electric tooth brush ! After a month , it was just too much for me . I went back to the dieing battery original , but soon got its replacement as a gift.The verdict : I 'm in my 40s and I 've had about 6 different dentists ( moving from job to job ) in 5 different states . One was a professor at a dental college . After each visit , they all proclaim my teeth are in excellent shape . I use the cheapest Oral B electric brush ( non pulsating ) in the morning and before bed with Colgate Total . I also floss just one time before bed and use the Crest rinse for night time . I get them cleaned every 6-9 months.Save your money and get the cheapest Oral B electric toothbrush . I think it is on sale sometimes for about $ 10 .	-1
The manufacturers of electric shavers appear to be taking pages out of the playbook used by makers of printers , which are often priced cheaper than the print cartridges themselves . Once they 've got you as a customer , they figure the red ink will soon be the customer 's , not theirs . Purchasing another screen ( my 3rd or 4th in two years ) for a shaver that cost me only 20 % more than the flimsy foil itself strikes me as exhorbitant if not exploitive . ( The least Braun could do is make the foil available as a separate item rather than bundling it with the cutter assembly . ) I 'd try a Norelco or Remington , but I think they 're all manufactured in China for the same U.S. company ( Gillette ? ) . I may bloody my face for a few more days before throwing in the towel -- or trying a Panasonic .	-1
This replacement pack used to work with Braun Series 7 ( 799CC model ) and I 've ordered it multiple times . I used this one because it was better than their other advertised replacement pack . Sometime in about the last year and a half , this part has changed ( but the name of the item has stayed the same ) and it no longer will fit the razor . So , not pleased with this of course ...	-1
Did not come in a box also states that it 's Lemonfresh.It 's not.Will not be buying it again.You have a pictures of something you are selling then you send something different to the buyer in my book.You are not telling the truth .	-1
I bought the Braun shaver and those were recommended with it so I got them but it turns out that they are for self cleaning shavers only .	-1
If you have any inkling you might not like the shaver ... . because they wo n't let you return itFunny that it is save enough to mail to us but not save to mail back to them ! ! ! ! Very Bad PR for Braun Products ! ! !	-1
I no longer have the shaver which requires these since this liquid eventually starts to eat away at the shaver itself . I replaced the shaver with a Panasonic that uses water/soap based cleaning solution instead of chemicals .	-1
I wish I had listened to the other negative reviews . But since I had a great promotion coupon ( got it for almost free ) , I decided to ignore them and try it out for myself - now I wish I had n't ! It definitely is NOT a massager , just a vibrating machine . Now I must confess that I was n't 'fooled ' or 'tricked ' or anything , I knew it would vibrate . I just figured that with so many positive reviews I might like the vibrating action . Trust me , if you 're not sure whether you 'll like a vibrating machine at your foot , chances are you WON'T.Since I ca n't return this product due to the promotion , I 've learned how to 'tolerate ' the vibrations by putting only portions of my foot on the machine at a time . For instance , I just use the ball of my foot or the toes only - then the vibrations do n't feel so bad . Still , who wants to learn how to 'tolerate ' a product ! As for the infra-red heat - I think most other reviews said the same thing , it 's lukewarm at best . I seriously doubt it could keep you warm in winter.So unless you actually like vibrating machines at your feet ( or if you get it for practically free like I did ) I would strongly recommend that you NOT waste your money with this product .	-1
Your Description : Even if it were perched on a spoonful of sugar , most aspirin tablets do not go down easily . But they do if they 're chewable and cherry flavored . We bet Mary Poppins herself would have switched to these low-dose tablets if they 'd been available when she was caring for the Banks family . In fact , Mr. Banks himself might have taken them , as they 're designed for adults , too , especially those on a doctor-recommended daily regimen of aspirin.Funny you should mention that ... Dick Van Dyke ( the chimney sweep in Mary Poppins ) lost his 13 year old granddaughter to Reye 's syndrome after being given 'baby ' aspirin ! ! NO spoonful of sugar there ! Further more , Bayer does NOT make this product anymore . In 2007 the aspirin manufacturer 's agreed to discontinue Childrens Aspirin due to Reye 's Syndrome ! They will send you Bayer 81mg 'baby ' aspirin - which will soon go the way of children 's aspirin ! Why ? This aspirin product is NOT for children under the age of 19 ! ! This product is NOT used for children 's headaches ! ! This product is NOT used for fever , teething , or any other symptoms in children without a Doctor 's supervision ! ! This product has been proven to trigger Reye 's syndrome a deadly and often fatal disease in children ! Please learn more about aspirin and children at [ ... ] ! Please learn more at The National Reye 's Syndrome Foundation 's website !	-1
This works to help moisterize your nose but it contains 2 types of parabens which are bad for you and possibly cause cancer I 'm not even sure why these are needed since the only main ingreidtant is aloe and water . One might just use aloe juice . There are other things you can use in place of this and they might be better off than putting parabens in your nose .	-1
Smells good but did not help me .	-1
If you have dry , cracked nasal passages this will sting like nobody 's business.It 's moisturizing effects only last for a few minutes and then you have to reapply .	-1
Whats great about Vick 's Vapo Inhalers are that they smell nice , are a little soothing , and they easily fit in any pocket.The problem however is that they ca n't and/or do n't work the way I expect them to.A stuffy nose is due to swollen membranes in the nasal cavity . If you 're COMPLETELY stuffed up , then you ca n't even inhale the product through your nostrils to work . This is flaw # 1 as you ca n't use a nasal product if you ca n't even breathe in or out of your nose.The 2nd reason for me that I 'm not impressed by the product is that if I 'm only partially stuffy , the product DOES NOT reduce any inflammation at all , at least not in me , and even if it could , the effect is only temporary on levels of only a few seconds . Not even a minute later , I 'd be right back to stuffy levels.I like the product because of it 's portability and smell and may buy it again because of that , but its not any solution to my nasal congestion problems .	-1
I have a horrible armpit odor problem , I have tried everything it seems like so I bought this and tried it out and it gave me horrible bumps on my armpits , it took forever for them to go away , i was not able to wear anything on my armpits except for Bromi-talc which helped for a few days but stopped as well . I am not sure what to do about my armpit odor problem , it is embarrassing and i just want to find something that works .	-1
I know everyone 's skin has a different level of sensitivity , so please keep that in mind when reading this review.I would n't say I have overly sensitive skin , but it 's also not the most hardy . I followed the directions to the letter with this deodorant and could not get it to stop burning and itching . Even the lightest of applications were awful .	-1
When I first read the reviews for this product , I thought this could really work . My dermatologist had prescribed a similar product before and I figured this would be a good OTC alternative.When I got the product I applied it for 3 nights in a row . After that my hands and feet were completely dry . I thought it was heaven and it gave me so much more confidence . I used it a couple of more nights and at the same time I started having a severe allergic reaction . My whole body started severely itching and I broke out in hives in a lot of different places . I went to my doctor who tested everything and could n't find a reason for the severe itching . I was in severe discomfort from the itching for about 2 - 3 months ! ! ! I did n't make the connection to the deodorant until this week . I had n't used the deodorant ever since the initial couple of applications . But I did put it on my hands again last week . My itching had just started to subside and I was so relieved . But after putting the deodorant on again the severe itch has returned.I started to search through all the different reviews of Certain Dri to see if anybody else experienced a similar reaction and lo and behold another reviewer experienced the exact same thing ! ! ! ! ! I also have to add that I am not particular sensitive to allergens . I have no other known allergies . But this was one of the worst experiences in my life . PLEASE USE THIS PRODUCT VERY , VERY CAUTEOUSLY ! !	-1
I wanted to give this roll on a try for a few weeks before I 'd jump into a definite conclusion . I 've been using Certain Dri for about 8 wks now . I bought it at a local pharmacy , was n't cheap . I followed the instructions and I got ta say that it only helped for the first few applications . After that I started having irritation , itching , skin staining , clothes discolored and the perspiration was back.I stopped using it for about 2 weeks to see if my body had gotten used to the ingredients and perhaps that made it stop working . But that did n't do it . I still wash 2-3 times a day with antibacterial body wash and wear antiperspirant deodorant . Certain Dri seems a temporary fix for a permanent problem . Wo n't buy it again , it 's just wasting money .	-1
I have severe lactose intolerance ( not an allergy , `` just '' intolerant ) and I usually use the `` Ultra '' form of this product . However , since I used to be okay with the `` Original '' strength Lactaid , I thought this might be more economical , even if I had to take multiple tablets . I was wrong . For some reason , these tablets just did n't work for me , even when I took 3 or 4 tablets for something that would be managed by a single `` Ultra '' tablet.So , if you are really sensitive to dairy products , then you 're better off with `` Ultra '' Lactaid , rather than `` Original '' Lactaid .	-1
The lactaid product is wonderful for anyone that is lactose intolerant . The lactase supplement helps greatly . But go with the tablets . I bought a box of the chewables , and they are terrible . I take them now just because I paid for a box and want to get my money 's worth . And once I finish this box , I will always go with the tabs . Granted , ther are more convenient in a place without water ... but at the same time , when would you be eating without any liquid to take it down with ? Stick to the tabs , you 'll be happier .	-1
Caused severe nausea and vomiting . Only took it twice before I figured this out . I will stick with lactose intolerance . It 's more fun !	-1
The chew-able tablets , worked much better for me . These are not as good as the original product . This appeared to be a good deal for 120 , but it 's not . You do n't save any money .	-1
I sent these back because you have to take 3 pills each time you need it . I ordered the one that requires only 1 pill each time .	-1
I tripled the dose before having a small scoop of ice cream at some friends and it 's 9 hours later with no improvement in my terrible discomfort all around . I was tested for lactose intolerance years ago although no milk allergy . I normally avoid it . I hope by the morning I 'll be better .	-1
Never used again cause they did n't help . Could be because i have a bigger problem , or because they just do n't do anything .	-1
Lactaid Chewable Tablets are heavily sweetened with mannitol , an alcohol sugar that I find problematic . When I told my GI doctor that I do n't seem to tolerate mannitol , he said , `` you and the rest of humanity . '' For me , at least , mannitol causes the same symptoms as lactose . In addition to the mannitol , these tablets have a strong , artificial vanilla flavor that does n't go well with foods containing garlic , for example .	-1
WHY is the tipped to this hooked ? ? ? ? Everything is wrong with this drop , WHY would the tip be hooked ? I ALMOST poked my eye out , I DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE TO ANYONE LET ALONE ANYONE WITH VERY BAD EYE SITE LIEK MYSELF . The tips hooked so you poke your eye out then all the drops run down your cheeks NON get into your eye , WHAT genius came up with this ? You can not reseal these to use later in the day like most preservative free drops you can . AND the tip CLOGS so you cant even use it a few minutes later even . If you try with pressure to unclog it it will shoot across your bathroom . What a mess these drop are , I ca n't belive something this bad is in production.WHY would you put SALT in your dry eyes ? That would dry them even worst or cause your eyes to become dependant on these drops . I researched this and any salt solution is not good for your dry eyes.DO NOT BUY . I 'm going back to systane .	-1

He 's not even 3 and flying cross country so we figured & # 34 ; try anything to keep him comfortable. & # 34 ; Yeah he hated these . Would not , absolutely would not , wear them . He flew fine without them , though ! Great idea , probably a great product , just did n't work with our boy .	-1
The reason for this is because of the design . Instead of having a tapered curved sleeve style plug similar to the Etymotic ER20s , these have sharp ridges stab into your ear canal . They feel soft to the finger but in actuality apply more pressure on the ear canal than the standard sleeved style ear plug . There are four ridges that taper in size and they really do push out on the ear canal as you push them into your ear . It hurts like crazy . Curved sleeve tapered earplugs , those ones lay against your ear canal and distribute the pressure across more ear canal surface . With these all the pressure reside along these sharp ridges.I 'm very disappointed in these . I thought they were sized for kids ( which they are ) , they seem to hurt more . I know earholes differ greatly from person to person . Mine happen to be about 3/16th of an inch in diameter . I really ca n't see any child wearing these comfortably , much less an adult with tiny earholes like myself .	-1
I do n't understand why this deodorant had such good reviews . It takes forever to dry and even afterward remains sticky . Also not a fan of the white streak marks this deodorant provides .	-1
You can get this for under $ 4 at Target.. even better , you can buy the Target brand maximum strength for under $ 3.. the Target brand is thicker , and does n't smell like an old lady drenched in 40 year perfume .	-1
While there is nothing wrong with the product , I am APPALLED by the magnitude of over-pricing on Band-Aid branded bandages . I am not blaming the retailers . I have also noticed that Band-Aid seems to be & # 34 ; eliminating & # 34 ; competing generic offerings , especially if they are in similarly sized boxes.Right after I received this I found packages of generic bandages with 100 total strips of assorted sizes at Walmart for 88 cents . That 's $ 0.88 ! I checked several Walmarts BEFORE I ordered Band-Aid , but there was no better generic offerings , it was only AFTER ordering that I found them.Nonetheless , I do n't have a & # 34 ; good reason & # 34 ; to return these ( oh , I would , if I could , but it 's not the seller 's fault , so I do n't want to make them take losses on S & H ; ) , but I will be avoiding Band-Aid brand with even more resolve now .	-1
To add the to review titled `` cheap as can be '' , I would like to add my reactions . The band-aid which is so thin , and sticky , that it comes apart is also hard on the skin . After 24 hours on a cut , I removed the band-aid . It was very difficult to remove , and then I noticed my skin was numb where the band-aid had been . Some days later that skin peeled off and now my skin is back to normal.I would like to avoid this type of band-aid , but since every type of band-aid comes in the identical wrapper it is difficult to tell which type I have . Some types do n't stick too well and others stick too much . All in the same wrapper . Why not color code the wrappers so we could know and remember which type works for us ? Over the years we have seen different band-aid types , none of which seem as good as the original which would stick on for days , without being too sticky , or harmful to the skin.Band-aid seems to change for the sake of change , without real improvement . BTW- can any band-aid be opened without simply tearing the wrapper for instance ? Unfortunately , there does n't seem to be any competition , and therefore , evidently not a real effective band-aid.Update 9/24/2013 - I just found that Kroger now has a bandage , [ sheer bandages ] , that stays on for at least some washings , come off without coming apart , and do n't numb your skin .	-1
I did not think a `` Band-aid '' would warrant a review but thought otherwise yesterday . These bandaids are cheaply made and very strange . I have found similiar types bought in a dollar store to be better.DO NOT use these bandaids on a child or an older person . I am not sure what the adhesive material is but once on your skin the only way to get it off is by Carefully peeling , piece by piece , as though you were taking a rubber covering off of something.Yesterday , was not the first time I used one of this particular brand of `` Band-Aids '' from my box , but it was the first time skin came off with the adhesive . I had a cut I needed to keep clean while I worked with house plants . The bandaid got dirty but not wet . I had trouble getting it off . I have learned getting the bandaid wet really makes it worse . Thinking the last section would come off with no problem , I gentley pulled and a section of healthly skin came off with it.I hate waste . These bandaids are dangerous in my opinion . Mine are going in the trash . Sending them back to Amazon would amount to nothing . Johnson and Johnson 's quality has fallen so far off the grid by their outsourcing they no longer seem to care.Bottom line -- if you do use this Band-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandage be aware of potential problems with the adhesive strip .	-1
280 band ads into a big box and left it up to the user to try to find the right size while holding a wound . Good lock with that . I have to sort them out into baggies some day .	-1
I gave this product one star because I did n't even have the chance to really test it 's effectiveness because it started coming off the same day I put it on . I followed all the directions , washed and dried the affected area , etc , etc . My blister was on my hand , while most other people seem to have them on their feet from running.The directions clearly show that it can be applied to your hand ( actually their illustration showed the product being applied in the exact same spot I had mine ) . Well it stayed on for a while until I had to wash my hands and then it just started peeling off.The product says it can get wet and is made to stay on . Do n't get me started on the cost of these either . Regardless of which option you chose , your paying at least 80 cents per cushion . That 's a rip off . You could purchase 40 band aids for that price , use some neosporin and replace them each day . Much cheaper.Would not recommend .	-1
*This band-aid is the worst band-aid I 've ever tried . First of all , there is almost no way to cleanly take the backing off the individual band-aid . It is tough to do , and you have to touch the part that is supposed to go on your wound to do it . IF you can take it off and NOT have the whole band-aid wriggle up into a sticky mess , then you deserve a prize . It scrunches up and sticks to itself like saran-wrap . I had to use about 5 each time to get one to even go on . Then it does n't stick ! It lasts only a few minutes before it loses its adhesion and opens up . The only thing it sticks to for sure is itself and that 's before you get it on the wound . I 'm not sure what the `` water block '' does , as the band-aid comes right off if it is exposed to water . The band-aids are very light and appear to be cheaply made.The only reason I used them at all is that I needed them and there was a delay of a day or so before I could replace them . I went through almost the whole pack in that time . I only bought one pack , not the 6 sold here , and I 'm grateful for that ! Not recommended at all , for any use that I can think of . *	-1
MOST OF THESE ARE SMALL BAND AIDS - NOT HAPPY WITH THEM AT ALL ... IF YOU NEED LARGE BAND AIDS YOU DO N'T WANT A WHOLE BOX OF THESE AS MOST ARE ON SMALL SIDE.RECOMMENDED FOR THOSE WITH SMALL CHILDREN .	-1
Folks , the `` active ingredient '' in this crap is Petrolatum - basically , that 's Vaseline Petroleum Jelly . And this junk contains 41 % of it . Regular Vasoline Petroleum Jelly contains 100 % . At less than 1/3 the price . So if you want to spent $ 6.00 on this vs. $ 1.50 on a Vasoline , please do n't let me stop you , but I 'm simply telling you basic science . The `` inactive '' ingredients include mineral oil and glycerin.This concoction is why pharmaceutical companies are despised around the world . Take $ 0.50 worth of Petroleum Jelly , throw in $ 0.02 cents worth of mineral oil and glycerin , and tout it as `` Advanced Therapy '' .It 's B.S . folks - pure and simple . Junk.Save yourselves some money and do yourselves a favor - but the cheapest Petroleum Jelly you can find ; Vaseline or store brand .	-1
I do n't know if technically the thing on my dogs ankle was a boil , but was hoping this stuffwould help draw out the gunk in it and it really did n't do much of anything after several daysuse . Others have been satisfied , but honestly I 'd give it half a star but to be fair I was usingit on my dog and probably the skin is tougher than what you 'd encounter with your average boil.If there is such a thing .	-1
I used a different product that is Acetone based so it dried & disappeared , leaving just the medicine in place . I like it still but thought a different product might be good so the fungus does n't get immune to it . As you might know , there is NO cure for nail fungus , not even by prescription , you can only control it . This product here is an oil , think what it can do to your socks or if any of it gets on carpeting etc . Also my nails started getting a dark cast to the top of the nails where this was applied . This product is no good .	-1
Tried every day for over a year . No improvement whatsoever and fungus spread to 8 other toes . Did n't work at all for me .	-1
I started using the Fungi-Nail solution shortly after my first order on 5/1/2013 . A lot of the reviews mention dramatic results . Given the vast differences in human constitution , I 'm not disputing these reviews . I have used Fungi-Nail religiously for 5 months , including regularly shaving down the nail to maximize exposure of the nail bed . I personally have not noticed any hugely discernible differences using Fungi-Nail . A slight improvement at best using only this solution . The name is indeed misleading , as mentioned in other reviews , and it does state is does not work on nails . On 7/2/2013 , I visited my dermatologist . I can not take Lamisil . She recommended using a solution of original flavor Listerine , distilled white vinegar directly after showering and letting it dry on the nail and surrounding tissue . She said to wear open toed shoes and no polish . She said it could take a year for a new nail to grow back healthy . She further explained that the deformed nail is the fungus ' opportunistic effect on healthy tissue . ( I knew this ... ) I 'm still using the Fungi-Nail solution several hours after the Listerine/vinegar application , once a day . I 'm seeing better results since using the Listerine/vinegar solution . We 'll see how my toe looks next May ...	-1
I purchased this stuff along with two other brands comprised of the same exact formula . It failed ! After trimming back the affected nails as far as possible , I saw significant healthy nail growth creep in for the next 9-10 months . However three bottles later , I was n't out of the woods yet . After a year and two month 's passing , now one toe is looking pretty bad again ( the nail lifted and turned yellow ) . It 's partially the same thing with two adjacent toes . There was some sign of good results ( pink healthy looking nails ) . But the still ever uncured infection remains present , still . So no dice ! The newer resurfaced infection came under new growth of healthy pink nails -- very unlike the first time . A whole newer ultra-paper-thin ( pseudo ) nail showed underneath the new grown nails ; they in time got re-infected . The newer nails eventually became thick and yellow , and very itchy again and then painful.Anyway , I suppose everyone 's constitution and physical make-up varies and this stuff does kinda work . Well sorta ! But I 'm looking for a new remedy , because this did n't get the job done well enough for me . One good thing is no other nails became infected after I began using the product .	-1
My wife needed something to protect the bottoms of her feet and reduce pain caused by several corns on her toes . She tried these and said it increased pressure making it more uncomfortable to walk . We were n't expecting it to feel like fluffy pillows , but these did n't help at all . Maybe someone with a different condition and foot shape would benefit from these .	-1
This is neither anti-fungal or antibiotic . The packaging is small and cheap . Go elsewhere to find a good product . Expensive .	-1
UPDATE AFTER PURCHASE : PLEASE READ ! ! ! THIS IS *NOT* WHAT YOU THINK IT IS ! ! ! The title of my original review was `` There 's NOTHING better than this '' And it read `` I have used this for years ... First as kids in my parents house and then for my own kids.Have been guarding the last container like gold ... soooo happy to have discovered it here anew ! etc etc `` I even ordered not one but SIX bottles of the stuff from American Wholesaler , Brooklyn , NYHOWEVER when I received it IT WAS N'T THE SAME PRODUCTThe container IS SIMILAR BUT IS NOT THE SAME PRODUCT.What I received is labelled `` Soothing , Protective Powder Helps prevent chafing and irritation - Keeps skin drier '' The original product ( the one pictured here as of Sept 10,2010 ) instead is `` Antiseptic First-Aid Powder For CUTS , Chafing and minor abrasions '' If it was just the label , who cares ... but the ingredient list is also different ! ! IT DOES NOT CONTAIN the active ingredient which is the antiseptic ingredient.Original : Active Ingredient Bismuth-Formic-Iodine followed by Inactive Ingredients : Bismuth Subgallate , Boric Acid , etcNew One ( the one on this listing ) Has NO active ingredient and the INGREDIENT order is different : Boric Acid , Magnesium Carbonate , Talc , etcThis stuff as listed is a fancy talcum powder like Goldbond , not the wonderful product we all remember.Make sure what you buy lists Bismuth-Formic-Iodine as its first and active ingredient.I asked for an exchange for the original antiseptic product I ordered or a refund .	-1
My gastroenterologist said to take sugar-free Metamucil . First I could n't find it ( must have been out of stock ; later was there ) then researched ingredients of the sugar-free and discovered it contains aspartame , which I feel is a poison ( Google it ) . If I occasionally get a little I do n't worry about it , but will not ingest it on a daily , deliberate basis.So I bought this regular Metamucil , started with a regular dose with plenty of fluid , experienced a pain like concrete at the duodenum , halved dosage and took daily with plenty of water . Every day I had worsening pain and cramps until one day it felt as though another dose would kill me . I have no way of knowing what reaction my body was having but I do suffer from more than my share of allergic reactions . Now you read what the ingredients are . FD & C ; yellow # 6 ? Google it . You may be startled . But that 's not all . Do you really need the sucrose ( sugar ) ? What about & # 34 ; natural and artificial orange flavor & # 34 ; ? Note the exact composition of & # 34 ; artificial orange flavor & # 34 ; is not specified . How does the manufacturer get away with that ? Then I asked friends whether they had any difficulty taking Metamucil . I got repeated stories of difficulties . Most simply refused doctors ' orders and discontinued the stuff.Now obviously I was determined to find a way to take the prescribed psyllium . So I did research then talked to my MD . It turned out that I could buy pure powdered psyllium husk by the ounce at a local health food store , so did n't have to sink yet another ten-spot in an unusable product but could assess with a tiny amount . The product is from a trusted company . Then I did more research and purchased pure powdered psyllium SEED capsules online , actually via Subscribe & Save from Amazon . Before I did that , I called the manufacturer to be sure there were no additives . I was pleased with the response.Guess what ? The pure psyllium is working . I prefer the capsules because when I mix the powder and take it that way , it 's hard to get that last bit of psyllium out of the glass . Then , obviously , I wash the glass which means that every day some grains of psyllium go down the drain where as we know , they expand to 50 times their size . How long before I 'll be calling the plumber because the drain is plugged ? Think about it.Metamucil - the use of psyllium husk ( or better yet , the seed ) - to solve health problems - is a real step in the right direction . But for some ( many ? ) of us , the additives are unnecessary and/or troublesome , to put it mildly . Thus I present my experience and my solution .	-1
This stuff burns my face and a bottle of it does n't last very long either ! ! ! ! I will never use it again . I once bought a bottle of Stetson Pre Electric that worked pretty good , but it was kind of oily ! For the most part , I 'm gon na used my old stand by : William 's Lectric Shave ! You ca n't beat the best ! ! ! !	-1
The odor was too strong for me . It was a fruity sweet smell but it was n't working for me . I had to wash my moustache within five minutes because I could n't stand it.Also the brown mustache had a strong white layer look to it . It was looking bad to me visually.It did hold the hairs into place for the brief time I used it.The only useful thing I got out of it was the small brush . Managed to pull one hair out but still nice addition to my comb / brush collection .	-1
I have heard rumors that some tubes of this stuff rock , while others do not . Regardless , I will not give it benefit of the doubt since inconsistent product is inexcusable . It did nothing for my mustache and I recommend it to nobody .	-1
I tried this product to get my mustache to stay down and not to bristly . Did not work as well as I had hoped .	-1
I received the product and tried it as per the instruction ... What a mess and very displeased ! WM	-1
The quality of the product was fine . It 's just that it does n't seem to really do anything . I 've had better luck with a pair of fine tip metal tweezers . I imagine a metal one would do the job better .	-1
I have used Superfloss for years- this new version is a caricature of the original product.What 's wrong with it ? 1- the threader part used to be longer & stiffer , thus making it easy to pass the floss under permanent bridgework , especially those of molars way at the back of the mouth . Now it 's short , flimsy , & bends so easily , it does n't do the job it was designed to accomplish2- the floss portion used to be much thicker , fluffier & stronger . Now it is a mere shadow of itself , and as such is totally useless . And , it shreds ! I had read the poor reviews , and always try to keep an open mind . Now I know that the poor reviews are spot-on . This stuff is worthless . Do not waste your money . Regular floss used in conjunction with individual threaders is a much better solution .	-1
I had to try this after reading its description . My denture comfort liner had come off ( as my orthodontist said it would ) and I could n't afford an airline trip to have him reline my upper denture . I was tired of my denture cream liquefying on me , and replacing the cream at least twice a day to keep my dentures comfortable . Even after I faithfully followed the instructions , I got poor results . It felt like I had a liquefying gummy worm candy in my dentures after several hours ... and , much to my surprise , the stuff came off in a gooey mass . I even tried letting the cream air out on my dentures -- it 's an effort , just getting the cream out of the tube -- hoping that exposure to air might mean better results , but that did n't work either .	-1
This may be the world 's worst product . It is hard to work with , even when following the directions carefully . Once in place , it squishes out of your dentures all over the outside . No matter how much you clean it off , moer of it squishes right back out again . In addition , even after letting it set for thirty minutes or more , when the denture is removed , the cushion grip plastic like substance stays in your mouth ; not in the denture . No doubt , this manufacture was trying to make a product to help people but it does not work .	-1
This company is horrible . I purchased a certain type of Peroxyl and they substituted it with a Canker and Sore version which is not my problem . I wanted the regular mouth rince . Yhis is a bad way of doing business .	-1
The wonderful reviews prompted me to buy this product . I did read the back panel as shown for the product before purchasing but I did not realize salicylate is a sulfa drug . Within an hour after taking the first and only dose I tried I had terrible intestinal cramps followed by ... well what that is usually followed by . The good thing is this has lead me to find out that this chemical is not just in antibiotics . Here is a website with more information about salicylate . [ ... ]	-1
This product did not work for me , after the patch was on my arm for several hours i still felt i wanted a cigarettei bought the E-cigarette and it helped a lot , i will not buy again	-1
I quit smoking twice , so far ( hope I wo n't have to quit a third time but that remains to be seen ... ) .The first time I used NRT , specifically NicoDerm . I followed all the three steps , for as long as it was recommended . It worked , I was able to quit smoking . Staying quit though , that was a whole different matter . I took smoking again after about 3 months , and kept smoking for 6 months when I quit again . This time around I used Allen Carr 's method , and it was by far a more efficient method . It 's all about mentality and unfortunately , NRT reinforces the wrong kind of mentality .	-1
These razors do not shave as close as mach 3 blades . They do not pivot and are quite dull . I used two and quit before cutting my face .	-1
I have a tough beard . Barbers have said no to giving me a shave . I have been using Gillette Sensors for years and thought I would try Gillette 's latest marketing innovation.I 'm now on blade 5 and believe I can make a decent assessment of them versus Sensors , for my beard.Comfort : Poor , they started out dragging and they still drag . Switched to a vibrator handle , no improvement . Feels like the blades are bending rather than maintaining a stiff edge . My face feels it.Speed of shave : At first it was taking me twice the time to get a mediocre shave . After 5 blades , it still takes longer than a Sensor , with far more strokes and , only on occasion , can give me as close a shave.Close in places : Poor , they are simply to big to get into tight places.Ease of use : Different and not in a good way . They are large and the Sensors are far easier to put on and take off.Overall : If you have a tough beard , I 'd recommend you buy a few and be prepared to bail and go back to whatever you were using . Or , take a pass altogether . I bought 15 blades and am stuck for a while.Another Gillette marketing gimmick that , for me , does not deliver .	-1
These were usable but barely . I ca n't explain how or why but they came duller than what I usually get at the store . I love the convenience of ordering online but I ca n't get myself to try these again .	-1
Having shaved with Gillette Mach 3 blades for some time now , I believe these are a knock-off . They do n't have the feel of new blades and certainly not up to Gillette 's standards .	-1
I 'm tired of this game where you think you 're buying the same product you buy in the stores but it is anything but the same ! This was like shaving with a dull twin blade ! Took me twice as long to shave ! I assumed `` mach 3 '' was mach 3 ! I 'm going back to buying them at costco !	-1
Bought both the Mach 3 and Mach 3 Turbo blades here within the last six months and was sorely disappointed . I purchased my first package from CVS off the shelf and fell in love with the blades and razor , thought I 'd never use another razor . Then I needed some more and purchased here and was extremely disappointed . The blades were dull , some of the blue strips were already partially white , and I found that with both packs I bought . All the carts I used nicked and scraped and caused irritation . They cost too damned much to accept that . I do n't know if these were counterfeit , used/recycled/resold , or just decreased quality from the factory and really I do n't care : Never Gillette Again . I purchased a Schick Hydro 3 and was careful to get it from the Schick Store on Amazon as well as my blades along with my Prime shipping and am very happy with my decision . The Schick is better than the Mach 3 even when the Mach is a good quality and is less expensive all the time . After shaving with Gillette for 44 years I 'm a permanent Schick customer now . Gillette has forgotten it 's customer and arrogantly thinks it can charge what it wants and sell crap to prove it . Bye Gillette , hello Schick !	-1
I find that the Gillette Sensor 3 gives a far superior shave that the Mach3 for no other reason than the head swivels too much . I consider this a waste of money .	-1
Instead of producing billowing foam , these canisters produce a stream of liquid . I 've also bought the gel version of this product and have endured quality control problems . You 'd be wise to choose a different brand .	-1
I wish that I had not purchased this product . It only comes out as a watery liquid - no sign of 'foam ' or even 'gel . ' If I could give it a zero star review , I would . DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT - you would be sorely disappointed . I 'm just going to trash the remaining five cans and write them off ...	-1
Lac Hydrin is the best ever . But the bottle I received is not the one pictured . 8 oz ! It 's dinky . My fault for not catching the size difference , but shady to show the picture of the large bottle when you 're selling the small one .	-1
My husband brought this home to me and I was excited to use it . I have very dry skin and I am always looking for soothing body butters that moisturize . Well this stuff is not even close , and should not be considered by anyone with very dry skin . It goes on smooth and then disappears , never to be felt again . My skin sucked it right in and was dry again in about 10 minutes . There is a reason why it states on the label to apply twice a day , but it still did n't make a difference . Its an ultra liquified lotion.I 'm happy it worked for other people , but like Marissa , it did not work for me . For the record , I bought Nivea Essentially Enriched body cream . I love it ! Its greasy at first , but my skin is soft , smooth , and STAYS moisturized all day , AND you only have to apply it once .	-1
make you skin feel tight , light sunburn , and did n't work great for me.Have scars on my neck , and there is n't much difference after using this	-1
Purchased this to use on a thyroidectomy scar immediately after surgery . I used it for a year before giving up . It did provide some relief to the itchy dry feeling of a healing wound but it did nothing to diminish the scar.I also used this on a scar left from severe acne immediately when it was safe to use . It actually made it worse . My scar became beat red . I discontinued use and began to apply aloe gel to the scar . Within one day the redness was gone and the scar began to diminish.There are positive reviews on this product , maybe it will work better for you . It 's very expensive , I would recommend trying an aloe gel first , I purchased a large bottle for $ 3 at Trader Joe 's .	-1
I read the ingredients of this product and was no concerned about a reaction with any of them , and I allergic to almost nothing . However , when I used this product I broke out in a rash and even got hives . So , just beware if you have had any skin allergies .	-1
Does n't work ! Who is going to remember to apply this 3 to 4 times a day ? ! the advance one is much better , works quicker and only have to apply it once !	-1
IT IS LIKE YOU PUT ON SOME PASTE . IT DOES NOT GO INTO SKIN BUT LAYS THERE UNTIL YUOUR SO MAD YOU PEEL THE JUNK OFF.DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS I ALREADY DID FOR YOU	-1
Went to a dermatologist to have a mole removed , and also asked about my still healing scar from a laceration ( 5 stitches ) . She said that this product does n't really work . Most of the results people get are from the skin naturally healing .	-1
i was told to take these for borderline anemia because these are supposed to be the best and least-upsetting to the stomach . well , after just taking it for two days , i had a terrible reaction to it , felt nauseated and could hardly eat for a week - i seriously thought i had iron poisoning or something . your body is supposed to be good at regulating iron level , so maybe it was just too much for me since my body was fine with my iron level.this is supposed to be the best iron pill , but it definitely was n't good for me . i highly recommend that you research and investigate before taking iron pills .	-1
This product ( by Nature 's Bounty ) claims that there are 1 billion ACTIVE Lactobacilli in the pills . The best established test for ACTIVE Lactobacilli is to give them substrate ( warm milk ) and let them grow over night . Test Result : Two pills smashed to powder and mixed with warm milk ( 37'C ) did NOT produce any growth ( fermentation ) overnight ! . That means that Nature 's Bounty is selling us Cellulose + Fructose flavored with strawberry . Should have done this test earlier . Will never buy from Nature 's Bounty again . And will start testing one after another other vendors . Hope there will be a product for real ? !	-1
The joke is that this deodorant is not the one we received , even though we wanted this one . Yes , I am aware that I am not rating the correct product , but another Speed Stick ( the one that comes in white and smears , and was the last one we wanted ) product . Makes anyone upset to order an specific product and receive a totally different product instead . That is why the 1 Star review . For if someone chooses this product and receives one they did not order , I think that would warrant a star . Noticed this has happened more than once , according to other reviewers , and that is Baloney , because what it means is that someone in a warehouse is substituting products at their whim.I know the actual product is great , exactly what we wanted , but since it is deceiving in showing the picture when there are no intentions on delivering that product , I give this one 2 Stars at most .	-1
My husband is very picky about shave gels , primarily because he is most concerned about razor glide and his sensitive skin . My mistake on this product was not purchasing just one can of this for him to try instead of getting him a six-pack , even though the price was under $ 3 a can with super saver shipping . He is not happy with this product . He 's been using this product since April and does not think that it lathers anywhere near as well as other products , namely , Gillette Fusion , which he prefers . Also , insofar as use on his sensitive skin , the gel is only so-so . The fragrance is okay with him . However , what he particularly does n't like is that the gel does not promote smooth razor glide . Now we have about four cans left , which he will grudgingly use , unless I can find him a deal on Fusion . He 's encouraging me to find one ... soon .	-1
I used the paste day and night and it did nothing . I do n't drink coffee or smoke cigarettes neither do I eat foods that stain your teeth . This is probably only food people that have teeth-staining habits such as the above . I just did n't see a different after about 2 weeks of use . If you want a whitening paste , try a better quality brand .	-1
Friend told us this works for his aches and pains . We bought 2 tubes for my husband 's arthritic knee and it does n't work any better then over-the-counter stuff ; which does n't work . Everyone is different but I still can not see how any topical will penetrate deeply enough to work .	-1
Putting Ice Water bottles at the end of my feet when I am in bed is way better than what this did for me . I guess it works from others that have swelling in the knees or different pain than I have .	-1
Not too helpful ...	-1
I have fibromyalgia and this was n't effective for me at all . bummer . It was recommended by Dr. Oz but did he actually try it himself ?	-1
I purchased this after hearing about good housekeeping secrets to staying young . This is the second bottle I have purchased and honestly I see no noticeable difference . I am 30 , in good shape , and take care of myself - I think I would notice a difference but sadly this seems to be a bunch of B.S. , do n't waste your $	-1
Ok ... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night . The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed , fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes ( I was already a little tired ) and then BAM I felt hyper . Every other time I tried it since then ? Nada . I might as well be drinking water.As for taste ... I love me some straight up spirits , so the alcoholy part did n't bother me . It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of , I do n't know.. some sort of flavored vodka . I 'm certainly drank worse things .	-1
I tried to use this but could not get past the taste . I took it several times any way but it did n't work that well either . Sorry	-1
Gaba by source natural seems to be the only thing for sleep over the counter that works . When you use this you 'll tast a strong alcohol tase . Almost like taking a sot of everclear . I think that 's the secret it 's the alcohol .	-1
ABSOLUTELY DID NOT LIKE THIS AS IT HAS QUITE A LOT OF ALCOHOL IN IT - THE TABLETS DO N'T - DISAPPOINTED IN THIS LIQUID FORM OF MELATONIN.RECOMMENDED FOR THOSE WHO ENJOY ALCOHOL AND CAN TOLERATE IT .	-1
These caplets are fine to swallow and have everything I need in them . My doctor told me I was low on iron so I 've been trying different vitamins with Iron in them . In these vitamins though is an additive that turns my urine to bright yellow no matter how much water I drink . I do n't care for that . I went to the doctor to see if I was having a bladder or kidney problem and all is well . The doctor told me it was the food coloring that they put in them . Why do that ?	-1
Used as described and they did n't work for me at all . I actually got more often sick while using them then not using anything at all . Went back to my regular brand of vitamins as these just do n't do it .	-1
will my quest for the magic bullet ever cease ? i guess not , because i continue to be a sucker for these types of pills . after reading a good review in first for women magazine , i ordered two bottles . i have taken it religiously 3x day with meals , and nada . zero . zip . zilch . nothing . sigh ... .	-1
This product does not work . I tried it and after 2 bottles , I saw NO results . Not worth the money , its a complete waste . I do n't recommend this product .	-1
I have been taking this for a couple of months and I ca n't really tell whether it is really effective or not .	-1
***EDIT**** this edit is written over a week after the original review , my original review had been very positive as I had noticed a quick response after taking this and seemed to notice fat loss and increased metabolism . However , after a week of taking this I noticed increased fat gain mostly in my stomach where I never gain weight which has been quite hard to lose . I 've also noticed that the side effects of increased temperature went away after s few days . I heard that cla only works if lifting weights or exerciseing heavily otherwise the acid turns into fat . I stopped taking it and am working on ridding of the excess stomach fat it gave me . Im currently trying cayenne pepper to speed up my metabolism which so far seems to be working.Note**I did NOT buy CLA Tonalin on amazon , I bought it in the grocery store ( Hannaford ) for about ten dollars but before I even got to the cashier , I was on my smart phone looking up the product on amazon to see how its rated . I trust the reviews on here so I decided I 'd make my own.Also**I am not overweight but I have gained ten pounds since the semester started at college . I could blame it on the beer or pizza but the only reasons I was indulging in those things was because I had gone through a very stressful event right before fall semester started and stress apparently makes me overeat all the wrong foods . I usually am extremely healthy and eat a gluten free , paleo diet.My weight was relatively stable in November ( and no still not overweight , just a much curvier version of myself ) . Then of course another extremely event had to occur right before final exams , by that point I given up the unhealthy lifestyle but still found myself over eating purely out of stress . I also never slept , I would n't fall asleep until past midnight , would have to get up at 5:30 am for school and then nap during the day . I was always tired and had headaches and stressed and anxious , and my sleep schedule and stress could add on weight , but eating too much on top of that made me gain weight like crazy . After gaining 4 pounds in a week I freaked out , I had to do something different , I could n't stand all of the excess fat , I could barely squeeze into my jeans ! I still was n't overweight but I definitely was n't considered tiny like I used to be ! So I started working out more ( not really but going from like one day to two days working out ) and tried very hard to eat less and de-stress during the day . I picked the CLA up while trying healthier habits and have noticed a big difference in fat loss . I gain weight mostly in my hip area and used to never have fat around my stomach so its very easy for me to tell if I 'm gaining or losing weight just by looking at my stomach and how much I can grab . ( Ten pounds ago I could n't grab anything ) . Well when I was at my heaviest I could grab quite a bit , around my bellybutton and my sides . This has decreased by about half . Also , my hips have a little less fat . And I had just picked up the CLA three days ago ! Now you could say , well this could be due to the increased exercise or eating less before taking the CLA and I agree , it could be . So I 'm only giving it 4 stars for now and I 'm going to come back and rate again . ( Though , my sleep schedule has NOT changed ) .However , there are things I have noticed immediately from these pills besides fat loss : -Increased temperature . I 'm ALWAYS cold plus I live in the second most northern state in the U.S. and its in the teens here . I 've gotten to the point where three hours or so after I 've taken a pill I have to go outside to cool down when my roommates are huddled in their electric blankets.-I 'm starving . Again , this is the same time frame as when I notice a dramatic increase in temperature ( about 3 hours after taking the pill ) . I feel like a teenage boy , I ca n't stop eating , and its not sugary fatty foods I crave like when I 'm stressed , its high carb foods , the quickest thing to fill me up , flavor not mattering . I 've been eating WAY more than usual from taking these pills . I used to only be able to eat toast in the morning , never for dinner or I 'd gain weight ( I love toast lol ) but now I can eat 2 slices at night ( 40 carbs ) plus potatoes and squash and soup and chicken and a whole bag of light buttered popcorn and hot cocoa and lemonade and a granola bar and coconut ice cream and not gain weight , which is pretty amazing , since before , I would only the vegetables and chicken and maybe 1/3 a bag of popcorn and hot cocoa and not gain weight.My schedule with CLA : *Breakfast : ( 6 am ) : I eat 3-4 slices of gluten free toast , greek yogurt , two cups of coffee . I do NOT take CLA , I figure my metabolism is highest in the morning and its not going to do much . *Lunch # 1 : ( 11 am ) : I have a spinach and fruit smoothie made with rice milk instead of fruit juice and only a little bit of yogurt . I do NOT take the CLA since the smoothie is really healthy compared to the rest of my meals . *Lunch # 2 : ( 1 pm ) : Full serving of Stir-fry with brown rice , light soy sauce , shrimp , and vegetables . I DO take a CLA at this point . *Dinner # 1 : ( 4 pm ) : Chicken , vegetables with light butter . I do NOT take a CLA . *Dinner # 2 : ( 7 pm ) : Chicken , vegetables with light butter , orange , hot cocoa , usually 20 min later..this is when cravings kick in . I DO take a CLA . *Dessert/Snack : ( 8:30-9 pm ) : Organic Popcorn , another hot cocoa , oranges , sometimes a granola bar or coconut ice cream . I DO take a CLA.So Overall , I eat like a hobbit . ( throughout the day ) . So I ca n't base it off the whole three meals a day thing but I do only take it 3 times a day . I take it with meals , usually later in the afternoon/night when my metabolism is lower . I also take it right after I finished my plate with ALOT of water.When I used to eat this much , I was gaining weight if I did n't work out . Now I eat this much and I 've barely increased my exercise regime , which is not intense , more weight training/resistance than anything , not much cardio at all.I 'm going to give it another week before I reply again.But what you should take out of this review so far is that I 'm young , healthy , not overweight , do n't eat really unhealthy foods , but I 'm used to being in a certain 5 lb range than I 'm out of . My increased weight was due to stress . The CLA seems to dramatically increase my temperature ( could be a direct correlation to metabolism ? ) as well as my hunger levels but decreases my cravings . I still have cravings but there very mild , I used to want to devour chocolate bars and cupcakes all the time ( I did n't but I wanted to ) whereas now , a hot cocoa suffices to curb my cravings .	-1
I bought 1 bottle , and took it faithfully as instructed while conbining excercise and good diet , but it did n't aid the fat loss process . I usually work out and eat healthy , and hoping that this product will accelereate the last 20 lbs that i wanted to loose after hitting a plateau , but unfortunately , it did nothing . It is like all other products out there , it 's a hit or a miss . It 's up to you if you want to spend $ 30 to give it a try .	-1
I love the peanut butter Balance Bars . People say these are good , but I thought they were horrible . My husband and older son did not like them either .	-1
I was hoping for a bit more energy and hoped these capsules would deliver the high claims from so many positive reviews . However , I observed no remarkable increase in energy . In fact , the only remarkable thing was the fluorescent yellow shade of my urine . Wo n't buy again .	-1
I bought mine a few months ago but only took them like 10 times or so . I only tried these because of the Rave reviews on here & I must say Im disappointed . Not only are they WAY TOO BIG , and have to take 2 which makes it a choir to take , a forgetful one at that ; but they dont really do much at all for me . It generally doesnt make me feel noticeably calm , relaxed , energized or anything . I expected so much better . Ill stick to my oneaday .	-1
You clearly see Stess B-Complex Caps . Well look carefully on bottle on right hand bottom it has Vit C in it . I can not take the acid of Vit C , thus had also ordered Ester C , non acidic . Greatly disappointed when it arrived to find the line under what you can see with any ease is saying VIT C also . I do well admit it was on confirmation of order but had to go back and read for first time . I look at what is on screen to order and seldom look at confirmation as most who order a lot on Amazon . Amazon , LOVE IT ! !	-1
I guess the vitamns are ok , but the big capsule it comes in is the kind that gets stuck in the throat too easily . I just about gagged to death this morning ( well , not quite that bad ) but bad enough so that I 'd finally had it ! I threw the rest away and will find an easiler to swallow B supplement .	-1
I noticed my daily multi-vitamin did n't have any Vitamin E in it , so I was looking for an appropriate supplement on Amazon . While looking through products and reading current literature , I found the following : - Vitamin E does not decrease mortality in adults , even at large doses , and may slightly increase it.- It does not improve blood sugar or decrease the risk of stroke.- Daily supplementation of vitamin E does not decrease the risk of prostate cancer and may increase it.- Studies on its role in age related macular degeneration are ongoing as , even though it is of a combination of dietary antioxidants used to treat the condition , it may increase the risk.- It may also contribute to osteoporosis.The most concerning is a study from the Annals of Internal Medicine : `` Meta-analysis : high-dosage vitamin E supplementation may increase all-cause mortality . `` Their final conclusion : '' High-dosage ( > or =400 IU/d ) vitamin E supplements may increase all-cause mortality and should be avoided . `` Vitamin E is theoretically helpful , but realistically it appears to be harmful . Some people have suggested the harmful results apply only to the synthetic version of vitamin E ( Dl-alpha ) , and not the natural , but there has been no study in peer reviewed literature to suggest `` synthetic '' or `` non synthetic '' matters . The names do n't even make sense -- they 're both synthetic , one is just a closer structural mimic of whats found in food . It is still synthesized , specifically by methylation of gamma and beta tocopherol vitamers ( plant oil extract ) .At the *very least* please try and stay under 400 IU/day . Good at chess , bad at life , as the saying goes .	-1
I thought I was ordering regular tip tweezers . I knew it said slanted but it does n't really warn you that the slanted tips are pretty sharp and thin . I do n't like them at all . I only gave them 2 stars because they are of a decent quality material .	-1
... not sharp edged enough , crooked when pinch/close together . Now I know to buy tweezers in person only , to ensure sharp enough with more precision .	-1
Bought this and found it didnt grab so good . Better to invest in the tweezerman equivalent which costs more i believe but better as a permanent solution	-1
I purchased these blades from MG Electronics via Amazon . These blades are horribly dull compared to the same brand of blades you may purchase from a reputable retailer . I was unable to get even one shave from the blades ( I have attempted with two ) . I will attempt to return these to Amazon . Do not buy these blades.Update : I have had a prompt call from the seller and they have informed me that they received a bad batch of blades and have happily agreed to accept the return and cover my shipping costs . I 'm pleased with the resolution from the seller and their prompt attention .	-1
The test solution is only good for 3 months after opening . This fairly means thata new bottle needs to be purchased every 3 months . We pay a significant amount of money to Lifescan for test strips that are useless unless tested using their solution that expires 3 months after opening . If Lifescan 's policy is to not rip-off its customers , then they need to include the test solution with the test strips .	-1
I DONT KNOW WHAT I GOT..BUT WASNT WHAT IS PICTURED AT ALL ! !

I KINDA LIKED THEM BETTER THE WAY THEY LOOKED AND WERE A LITTLE LONGER BUT STILL CONFUSED BECAUSE THE PICTURE HERE DOES `` NOT '' SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THAT STRIP IN THE DESCRIPTION IT DOESNT SAY IT AND NO REVIEWS MENTIONED IT ( USUALLY ALL WHITE SO THOUGHT I 'D COME HERE AND SEE IF ANYONE MENTIONED IT ...

lately with all the style changes I ca n't find what I want but they wo n't send me samples because I had samples before ... yes , I did , a long time ago and they keep changing the product and so I asked for current styles samples ... I am not happy with the changes and finding it difficult to find a brand that suits e as well as Tena USED TO DO	-1
These are useless ... they claim to be for heavy flow and long . They leak and are so short and thin , they should n't be misrepresented with the description you are using	-1
What happened to the quality of TENA pads ? They are nothing compared to what they used to be ! I will not be purchasing these any longer . POISE has much higher quality pads ! !	-1
This item does not provide full coverage as the picture suggests . It is small and the picture is deceiving . This product may work during the day , but I do not suggest overnight .	-1
I wanted a 'booster pad ' .. I thought that I had ordered 'booster pads ' .. I wanted a pad specifically designed to be placed inside of an adult wrap-around brief to add extra capactiy to the wrap-around brief by absorbing liquid until the 'booster pad ' was full and then passing excess liquid through the 'booster pad ' into the outside wrap-around brief . In effect making the wrap-around brief much more absorbent .. 'boosting ' its capacity.This is NOT what I received . I received a pad that is designed to be used by itself . These pads have a plastic outside cover designed to fully trap all liquid into the pad . While this is fine .. this is not what I thought I was purchasing.There is nothing in the ordering information to clarify this . There is nothing on the package to clarify this . IF I was purchasing this item in a store .. and holding the package up reading about the contents .. there is no disclamer stating that these pads are NOT 'booster flow-through pads'.The problem is that I ordered and that I received three ( 3 ) shipments of these pads .. each of a different design .. made by Tena and purchased through Amazon . Again each different but each the same in NOT being 'booster pads'.OH YES I KNOW.. You cut .. You slice .. the exterior plastic covering of each pad as you use it and you thus modify these types of pads to become 'flow-through ' pads because you have .. by cutting the plactic outer covering .. made them 'booster pads'.Smiles .. NOT The End Of The World by any means ..	-1
What obviously should have been listed as a three-pack of 36 pads each for $ 49.50 is a priced ( AND SHIPPED ) single pack of 36 pads . If this is , as Amazon claims , a change in supplier that has resulted in this HUGE increase , then Amazon NEEDS TO FIND ANOTHER SUPPLIER . Telling their customers that this is a legitimate product price increase just shows that Amazon.com is not paying attention to their customers AND their products . I hope someone at Amazon.com is looking at these recent reviews , since they do n't seem to be taking their e-mails seriously about this ludicrous price increase ! For people who need this product for medical problems , many of whom are on fixed incomes , these pads can still be found elsewhere for between $ 17 and $ 19 for a package of 36 pads .	-1
These are made for an obese woman not for a man . These are so wide and way too long that they are uncomfortable and do not fit normal men .	-1
This box is hard to open , and I have rather strong fingers . But it is designed for medical use , so many of it users are sick and/or old people , who are physically weak . A pill reminder which requires physical strength is an absurd .	-1
I love the clearblue monitor . It has been consistently reliable for me and I used it successfully to conceive my son . Once I bought these test sticks off Amazon , however , the monitor is n't working properly anymore . I 'm backing up my ovulation tracking with OPKs I bought at the drug store and despite the fact that they are showing an LH surge , the monitor is n't . This has never happened to me before . The ovulation tests from the drug store always coincide with the monitor . My cycle is so reliable and the monitor has been so reliable in the past that I suspect something is wrong with these sticks I bought off Amazon . I will not be using them next month . I will be buying a new box from another vendor .	-1
I bought this from someone NIB some time ago and have been using it for two cycles , and I 'm not yet impressed.I 've heard it `` takes a few months/cycles '' to `` learn '' your cycle , and some of the reviews I 've seen on here are making me very concerned that I wasted my money on this.IMO it should not have to `` learn '' my cycles . It should be reading if my LH and estrogen are increasing or not , no matter where in my cycle I am nor how many cycles I 've used it , as well as it should n't matter how many sticks I put into it . I do n't like the fact that it may read my levels incorrectly and cause me to be `` off '' on when my O date is . I might as well use OPKs and hope my husband and I have sex at the appropriate time to conceive.I like the six hour window ( three hours before and three hours after I hit the button ) . I like its ease of use.I am very unhappy with this product and feel that it is a waste of my time and money . The monitor has been reading HIGH fertility for the past few days , but the lines indicate it should be LOW fertility ( HIGH fertility shows two lines , Peak shows only one line , that is next to the pee end . Low shows only one line far from the pee end ) .Updated 6/7/2010 : Well today I decided to test my monitor by placing my LOW one from CD9 current cycle in the monitor for today ( CD26 ) . Now , remember , on CD9 the monitor read it as LOW . Well today the monitor read it as HIGH ! I 'm very upset and pissed that this monitor does not work . Unfortunately I most likely can not get a refund for this , or any type of compensation from Clear Blue .	-1
I got this monitor three years ago after trying for 5 months to conceive . I used the monitor as directed and it was showing high and peek days but I never got pregnant . I used the monitor for 8 months and at the end the monitor cause me to have depression cause all my life was based on that monitor . My husband and I converted into a machine and we did what we did when the monitor said its time to do it . It drove me crazy to a point that I told myself this is it and I took the monitor straight it to the garbage.So for some it may work right away but every case it 's different and every woman is different . Even though I gave it only 2 stars it does n't mean it wo n't work for you . I think everyone should try the cheaper urine test first for few months and see what happens . If that does n't work and you want to try it go for it . At the end I did get pregnant with my twin boys but it was via IVF no with the help of the monitor.P.S . Lot of reviews said the monitor did not work . There is a chance that the monitor you got was previously opened and used by someone else ( that happens with online shopping all the time ) however even then there is a way of cleaning up the entire information in the monitor by using old ( used stick ) and start fresh . That solves lots of issues with the monitor . It 's like resetting the entire thing and starting fresh .	-1
I have been using this monitor since January 2011 . I have not relied solely on it I am also doing BBT . The first month , since the monitor has to `` get used to your cycle '' I used in in conjunction with BBT AND ovulation sticks . The first 3 months , the monitor worked very well -- its readings were clear , accurate , and matched up with my BBT . After 5 months of using the monitor and 12 months of TTC total I started to get worried so I saw a reproductive endocrinologist -- I am only 33 years old.For the past 2 months , the monitor has told me my fertility was still high just a few days before my expected period -- and one month it told me I had not ovulated at all nor did I have any `` high '' fertility days . Yet , that same month my RE did an ultrasound and said that yes , I indeed ovulated ! ! I missed out on prime fertility time ! ! I am so disappointed . I had been scheduling around this monitor and to know it is this inaccurate makes me angry . And it is not cheap either -- neither are the sticks . So sadly , I am done with this . I thought I was some kind of freak since it was not working for me . Even my RE said to `` Throw it out , it 's only stressing you out anyway '' . What a waste ! I give it one star and I 'll give it an extra one since it did seem to work for the first 3 months . But if you do n't get pregnant within 3 months of using this , do n't worry , do n't stress and try something else .	-1
I normally do n't leave bad reviews , but this was a pretty expensive and frustrating item for us . The results were not consistent with other ovulation testing methods such as apps , temperature tracking , and tests done at the doctor 's office . I wish we had n't wasted our money .	-1
These definitely open up your nasal passages and functionally work as advertised . However , the first night I used them I woke up with a bruise-colored mark on the bridge of my nose where the strip was resting . The next time I tried them , I tried to put it on with more of an arch so it did n't rest against my nose . It did n't leave a mark in the morning but was surprisingly difficult to pull off and left a sticky residue on my nose that I had to scrub off . If this is the sensitive skin version , I definitely would n't want to try the normal version . Maybe I will give them another try and try to wear off the stickiness by sticking it to my shirt or something first , but I have n't been to excited about them thus far despite the many positive reviews that others have given .	-1
I really wanted these to work . I seem to get congested at night and these seemed perfect . I tried everything - different kinds of soaps , washing my nose two/three/four times , even different types of towels - but these would just not stay on . Even using two at a time did n't keep them on . They 'd only stay on for about an hour and then they 'd peel off the sides of my nose and just be stuck to the top . I 'm glad they work well for others , but for some reason , they do not stay on for me - and yes , I followed the directions/placement exactly .	-1
these are a dry wipesI ordered these wipes for my father , But they are useless , these are dry dry wipes	-1
Lightly scented waste of money . Like others I wanted this to work but it was n't going to happen . My quest for a natural deo continues .	-1
Only reason I gave these two stars is because I got them so cheap and they last for a time . Overall , I find that these ear plugs simply do not last nearly as long as virtually any other ear plug I 've used . I might use them for a week and they 're shot . The comfort level is good but they quickly get deformed . If I had my choice , I used to use these 3m ear plugs and a set of those would last nearly two months . But I have a hard time finding those anymore . *sigh	-1
Do not waste your money . This thermometer only measure 1/10 of a decimal point and it is such a pain to use . It remembers your last temperature and displays that instead of taking your current temp when you turn it on . There is only one blue button and I have yet to figure out how to make it start recording my temp - I push the blue button once and it shows yesterday 's temp , hit it again and it flashes blank but nothin else happens . The beeping while it records ( when it finally starts ! ) is pretty quiet and I do n't really mind that . I just wish it worked consistently and actually measured the extra decimal point . I 've been using this to help diagnose hypothyroidism , but I would not recommend this thermometer for any purpose !	-1
I think there are better options out there . I like that it 's pink , and the back-light is helpful on dark mornings , but this thermometer makes this super annoying beep every time you use it - like every five seconds until it 's finished . Though some reviewers here say you can put your thumb over the little hole where the sound comes out to dull it , that really does n't solve the problem . It wakes my husband and my dog ...	-1
This is potentially a good solution for some , not me . After a couple of hours of use it became uncomfortable . There is a thick inner ring that becomes uncomfortable . It may be right for a smaller , lighter person . I am over 200 lbs .	-1
I used this after I had a baby and needed stitches . I thought it would take the pressure off the stitches and give comfort , but it actually seemed to irritate my stitches instead . : (	-1
I found this cushion to be too small , and too firm . I did not find it comfortable to sit on and returned it back to Amazon as it was of no use to me . Those that prefer a lot of support might like this cushion .	-1
sitz baths are always recommended for people with inflammation in the nether regions , but it 's so uncomfortable to use . Normally , I sit in an inch or two of really hot water in the tub , so I 'm going back to that . It 's easier and more comfortable . I 'd return this but that would seem really gross and weird .	-1
The shipping box was in good shape but the product box arrived opened and the inner sealing bag was open as well . The product had multiple hairs on it , various other dirt , and oily rub marks were visible in light where perhaps someone attempted to rub it down to clean it . The inner bag 's sealing tie was broken and the product box appeared banged up and used . The overall impression I got from the product and it 's inner packaging was that it had been used . Needless to say , I will not be attempting to use it . In a hygiene-sensitive item like this , cleanliness is paramount . The thing should be sparkling . Great care should be taken to provide NEW , clean products , and especially so when selling products for the `` nether regions '' . Disappointed with this transaction but thankfully Amazon allowed a quick refund .	-1
If your thinking about getting this , becuase of the review rating , think again . This stuff is terrible . It did nothing but give me a stomach ache . I 'm not a huge health fanatic that knows all about the detox and clease process . A year ago I took Yerba Prime and it worked really well . I decided to try this one , becuase it was cheaper . Well you definitely get what you pay for . I do not recommend this product at all . Horrible ! !	-1
For all the risk of putting this into my body , it was n't worth it . There are many different bodies though , and needs ; maybe it will work for you .	-1
Same review left at other link for same product -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I have tried several wrist braces , including this one . I have theMueller Wrist Stabilizerwhich is maximum support ( I 'd say ) which is MUCH better than this Futuro Deluxe Wrist Stabilizer which is ALSO maximum support -- both have metal 'spoon ' equivalent . I had both of them , and it 's a no brainer to get Mueller because they 're Exactly the same expect that the mueller fits Both hands whereas the futuro fits only one . Dumb difference . I also haveMueller Hg80 Wrist Bracefor medium support , which is sturdy and flexible at the same time . For something with milder weightiness and noticeablity , I use the ACE wrap with thumb loop . ( Ace Wrist Brace Velcro 7306 - 1 ea ) ..I got it from Albertsons for around 4bucks , and it works GREAT . The thumb loop can be great ( keep it in place and prevent slipping ) or annoying ( when you want to wash hands ) , but in the latter situations I 'll just tuck in the loop and it 's like it was never there : ) I also usedFuturo Wrap Around Wrist Supportfor the same 'milder weightiness and noticability ' purpose , but those were horrible failures and I 'm now planning/trying to give them away.There are also wraps at the 99cent store which are AWESEOME.Elastic Wrap - For Wrist , Ankle & Elbow , 1 pc , ( SuperBand ) These are cool to have around if you have multiple injuries , because they 'll work on many joints Plus they have velcro on one end , so you literally just wrap and stick . Very quick and easy , and will make your joint happy.Ok , Good Luck ! I know I would 've appreciated reviews when I was making my purchases . Hope you get better and eventually do n't even need these .	-1
Homeopathic is just a fancy way of saying placebo . Its all about what you believe . I did extensive research after I bought these because it was not working for me . It might have worked , but a placebo is broken once you arent convinced it isnt doing what it says . If you want something to believe in to make you think your skin is clearing up , then this is perfect for you . However if you are looking for something that is going to ACTUALLY do something , you need to find another product .	-1
it product would have been good but it LEAKED ALL OVER THE OTHER STUFF THAT CAME WITH IT . problem is , it did n't have a safety seal , which seems very odd to me . my front door step is still greasy from the product that leaked all over the box . very disappointed to know that the company did n't use a safety seal on their product	-1
I am allergic to both almonds and apricots . This product is advertised as `` Pure vitamin E '' with no ingredients list . I take vitamin E and have used vitamin E oil before , and never have I seen one containing almond and apricot oils . I am SOOOO glad I read the ingredients . I almost did n't , did n't occur to me that I needed to , but as the bath was filing , I turned it around and read it . Just goes to show that one should always , always be careful when dealing with allergies . Needless to say , I 'm relived that I read the ingredients and disappointed that this was n't listed anywhere on the Amazon site . Many people are allergic to nuts . This product is going in the garbage .	-1
I tried this a while back and found that it irritated my sensitive skin ( even the one formulated for sensitive skin turned my face red ) . Aside from the ingredients probably causing my irritation , I believe exfoliating your facial tissue to be too harsh ( and scrubs like this with ground up pits can lead to micro cuts and scarring and just exacerbate more acne ) . I 'm happy that this works for others so well , but I 'll stick to my twice weekly homemade fruit acid peels .	-1
I have bought & used this product a few times over the years . Years ago this had concentrated scrubbers in it but now does NOT . To me a total waste of the intention . I want an exfoliator tht has a very concentrated amount of scrubbers to do the job with less . More cost effective & less work for me that way . I have bought & used MANY over the years . My skin is not sensitive so Im lucky that way . I really like Olay microbermabrasion in the little tub for exfoliating because its super concentrated . Overpriced though . I have found myself buying a few different scrubs that dont work well but I dont want to waste them so I am adding microderm crystals to make my own for much cheaper . I buy them here from Amazon it makes things much more cost efficient & really does the job . I also use Gly acid & a few other chemicle peels 1x per week during the winter for more maintenance on my skin as the years pass . I still get my ID checked at 38 so something must be working ! Im a believer in starting young for skin preventitive maintenance . Always use sunscreen too ; - ) . If anyone knows of any really good concentrated microderm , exfoliator , polish then reply post it please ! ! ! Happy scrubbing !	-1
I had read reviews by others saying that this really helps with sensitive skin . However , I found this made my breakouts even worse . The scent was n't bad , but I wanted something that would help control/prevent breakouts .	-1
I have sensitive dry skin with mild rosacea and was looking for something that could scrub off the dead dry skin but not irritate my face too much . I started using this and was initially happy with the results . It worked well and left my skin feeling clean and dead skin free . About 4 or 5 uses in , everything changed . My skin broke out into this weird texture . I had tiny skin-colored little bumps all over my face and my face felt like sand paper . I 've never seen my skin do this before . Everywhere I had used this scrub was bumpy and irritated . My skin was n't red but it felt like it was crawling and very irritated . I immediately stopped using this and after a week or so of just water , my skin finally started to clear up.Needless to say I will NOT be using this anymore . I guess my skin either did n't like something in this scrub or is just too sensitive .	-1
These do n't work . They peel your skin off though . Make your nose look and feel weird . I would n't buy these again . I actually went to a sleep study and have mild sleep apnea . I 'll be getting my cpap machine next Monday so I can finally stop snoring .	-1
I am impressed with the size of this thing as it has a huge capacity , the problem is with the doors . If you have the compartments filled with pills the doors can open up unexpectedly making a mess of your meds .	-1
I have two of these , and although each compartment is only partially filled , the lids pop open and spill the contents . This happens much more often with this size , than with the regular size . I have to tape the lids closed after each filling.The size is nice . But you can see a gap between each lid and the bottom , so they let humidity in more than the regular size.I would prefer the kind with a single lid , and 9 compartments , each about the same size as these , but this is no longer available .	-1
While it is exactly what it looks like ( A large box with seven compartments and daily labels ) , it is very difficult to open . There is only the tiniest sliver of plastic to push up to open one of the compartments , and it locks very tightly . I have full dexterity and I often resort to opening it with my teeth . I would expect that kind of clasp on something that will go in a backpack , not something for around the house . If you want something 'child-proof ' then this is good , but if it 's just for personal use then find something easier to open .	-1
strips repeatedly gave a negative result , even though I i think im in Ketosis ... they didnt work the first time i used them but i was just getting off of atkins . Now i started again and Ive lost 15 lbs in less then two weeks and i want to keep track of my levels.I will just shell out the cash for the ones in the store . they will work	-1
I was on a no-carb diet and wanted to see if I was in Ketosis . These kept returning a negative result even though I knew I was in Ketosis and Ketostix confirmed that . I 've heard similar complaints from other users of this product . Stay away	-1
oh yeah , disposable razors are cool ... . that 's why they use them in prison ! just kidding , as cheap plastic razors go , these are OK. Maybe good for travel . but if your looking for a great shave , no . spend the extra bucks for a cartridge-or , even better , and old school safety razor .	-1
I 'm not into the flavor of this . It tastes like Starburst candy with the same texture . I 'm not a fan of this .	-1
Why anyone would subject themselves to consuming this horrid concoction unless they are close to death is beyond me . This is the most foul tasting power bar I have ever had the misfortune to consume . It 's rather gooey in texture and bitterly sweet with an overpowering , intense , awful fruit flavoring . It 's loaded with sugar and calories , which is what a power bar typically consists of , but I 've had others that at least did n't leave your taste buds damaged for the rest of the day . Unless you are absolutely desperate for some carbs , avoid this one at all cost .	-1
Strawberry is definately there . There 's definately a ton of vitamin flavor in here also . The first taste , well , chalk comes to mind . Then bitter . Then sweet . Then strawberry . A little bit of dairy . Then , well I really needed to clear my mouth with something else.Smoothie flavor ... . not a chance . It 's stiff , sticky , chewy , and sickeningly sweet.How does it compare to those nasty marzipan bitter vitaminie energy bars ? Well this one is just vaguely tolerable compared to those.Sorry , I 'm afraid I 'd rather go hungry .	-1
Power Bar Fruit Smoothie , Berry BlastI like the flavor of this bar , but , the ingredients show too much sugar for me and not enough protein . If it had less sugar and more protein , I 'd recommend it.Gunner June , 2008	-1
These are n't terrible . I know , hardly a ringing endorsement , but I was a bit divided about the things . They 're not terrible . But they 're not particularly good either . Now , PowerBars have their own unique flavor to start with , and I can deal with that . I even buy them when I travel and need something to much on the flight . But this flavor was a bit odd . Okay , I know what it made me think of - those rubber taffee things we used to eat as kid , the long wide sticks - that 's what they taste like . Kind of a fake fruit flavor . Again , not terrible , but would I buy it again ? No . Try it if you 're curious , but buy one - not a pack .	-1
As someone who has eaten his fair share of Powerbars , I found this to be my least favorite of all . The first bite tasted like Flintstones chewable vitamins from my childhood . As I ate more , the Fliststone 's taste lessened a bit , enough for me to finish the bar.It tastes like a raspberry-blueberry mix might taste . It definetly does not tast like strawberry , which is the first-listed berry on the ingredients list . To its credit , only raspberries and blueberries are pictured on the wrapper.This product is very soft . The softness makes it feel like it melted , but that is not the case because it was room temperature . It is very chewy and is easily mishapen because it is so soft . The texture and grittiness reminds me of Airheads candy , but much , much softer.Overall , I probably would not purchase this product in the store now that I have tasted it . I would like to try the other flavors though .	-1
I tried this Powerbar with another person . We both were not pleased with the taste . We felt it was oddly grainy in texture and while we could tolerate the berry taste , we did n't think we 'd ever want another One ! I do n't think we are going to finish this bar . Not the best I 've ever tasted and I would never buy this again !	-1
I ate two small bites of this Powerbar ( it was a free sample ) , then decided my usual `` do n't waste food '' rule was not going to be obeyed in this case.I ca n't imagine anyone choosing this product for any reason other than perceived convenience . Basically , this is a paste which has been extruded into a rectangular `` bar '' shape . To me , it tasted artificial and highly processed ( maybe not as bad as a Twinkie or Fruit Loops cereal , but still kind of `` icky '' ) . It definitely did not taste like a berry smoothie to me ; instead , it tasted like finely ground oatmeal mixed with overly sweetened fruit juice.The first ingredient listed is sugar cane syrup , while the third ingredient is sugar . Rice flour , oats , soy and locust beans are mixed with dried berries , juice concentrate ( pear , pineapple , apple , and peach ) , milk protein isolate , and additional ingredients including almond butter , minerals , vitamins , and amino acids are added . The resulting paste is colored with beet juice.I 'm left thinking a far tastier and healthier snack for athletes would be a banana and a handful of almonds ( and that option would cost less than fifty cents ) .	-1
I was disappointed in this bar . It seemed at first like it would be a good item . It smelled really good , and I liked the texture . Kind of reminded me of Airhead candy.Now the fruit taste is pretty good actually . And it is easy to chew so no complaints there . But other than that , I have nothing but complaints about the bar . I mean come on , ultimately what 's the most important thing the consumer will care about . The taste . And that is a big F on the old report card.The bar is not smooth at all . It has a very fruity taste which is good . But soon it is replaced by a gritty , grainy taste that overpowers any tastiness of the bar . Overall , it comes across as kind of nasty . I would never spend money on this . Come on guys . You can do better..	-1
Good try , but these taste too much like over-sweet chemical mush bars that leave an semi-acrid aftertaste . The Chocolates are the best , hands down . This one tastes like sweetener that resembles oatmeal was added . Very fake . They are edible , but they are overpoweringly chemical .	-1
It 's a cheap aftershave that smells like original Old Spice to me . Or some other old man scent . Now for background , I do love the smells of some classic barber shop after shaves and shaving creams but this one is n't the one for me.Additionally , this leaves your face very dry and tight . I tossed it after a week of use .	-1
I purchased Pinaud 's Bay Rum and loved it . So much so I decided to give more of their products a sample since they are very affordable . This one is by far my least favorite which is a nicer way of saying my most hated . Aside from this and the Bay Rum I also used the Special Reserve and of the 3 , this is the only one I would never wear in public . The smell was very flowery with a bit of a baby powder smell . I think it sort of reminds me of Avon 's Skin So Soft or Magno Black Glycerin Soap by La Toja . It smells much closer to Magno , but since Magno is only slightly familiar here now in the U.S. ( I 've only seen it sold in Spain and here on Amazon ) Skin so Soft is also kind of similar . That in itself does n't seem so bad except it is REALLY strong and it stays strong for a long time.Overall , I think all of the Clubman products are great at soothing your face after a shave , better than most I would say . That is probably why so many barbers swear by the stuff . However , Clubman also has a load of different scents to choose from and this one is definitely NOT my style . I wish there was a way to sample the scents before buying , but Clubman is more likely to be sold in a pharmacy than a fancy department store where there is a girl at the perfume counter waiting to let you sample everything under the sun . The good news is that a bottle will usually run you between 3 and 5 bucks so even if you have to buy their entire lineup to find one you like , it would still be cheaper than most of those trendy expensive brands that smell great but feel terrible after a shave.I REALLY hated the scent of this stuff , but I have n't sworn off clubman just yet . Their Bay Rum is great and there are still lots of other scents in their lineup I 'd be willing to sample . It feels great and its cost effective provided you find one that fits you .	-1
I bought these expecting a soft head , but it was rather hard and I really do n't like them . It also has a large head ( as advertised ) .	-1
These were n't as soft as advertised . I wonder if they are mislabeled hence the rock bottom pricing ? I would n't buy again .	-1
IS NOT SOFT . not happy w/it , therefore do not use it ! I USE IT TO CLEAN COMBS & BRUSHES OK !	-1
Overpriced anywhere you buy it . Honestly , Bactine works better and is far , far cheaper . Bactine will heal your cold sore in 1 week where this can take 3-4 weeks and require 2 bottles of it !	-1
I ca n't believe how high the reviews are for this stuff , but I guess different things work for different people . I got a ginormous cold sore a few days before I was to start a new job ( I tend to get them when I 'm stressed and not getting enough sleep ) . I paid $ 14 for this itty bitty tube because I was desperate to get rid of the cold sore quickly ... well , Abreva did NOTHING ! I ended up going to the gas station and buying a tube of carmex for $ 1.29 which dried up the sore in a couple of days.I have since started using deodorant ... yes , it actually works ( has to be gel ) . I got this tip on youtube from a girl that suffered chronic cold sores after I got another huge outbreak before a big party . I use Almay gel hypoallergenic deodorant ( costs less than $ 3 at the drugstore ) . I apply it to the cold sore at night with a Q-tip and after the first application the sore is half the size . I use carmex during the day . I 've found that if I apply Carmex the moment I get that tingling , I wo n't get a cold sore so I always have carmex on hand . But if I do n't use the carmex in time and have an outbreak , I just use the deodorant and it works ... significant improvement after one use and within 4-5 days the sore is completely gone.Now I only get 1 or 2 cold sore outbreaks a year . To me , Abreva is way too expensive and minimally effective . If you 're going to spend $ 14 on this I 'd spend $ 5 and try the carmex/ gel deodorant 1st .	-1
My cold sores are rare and pop up without any tingling . Once it pops up ... not much you can do or abreva . I find regular toothpaste helping better than this.Abreva does not relieve pain either .	-1
this product is misleading . it relieves symptoms of cold sore , but it does not shorten the duration of cold sore . it 's way too expensive when you can get carmex for a buck .	-1
I have to deal with cold sores about once a month , and I 've always used Abreva mostly because their arguments seem compelling ... FDA approved , # 1 pharmacists recommended , TV ads , blah blah blah . About 3 months ago , one of my sores was bigger than usual that would n't dry out after 5 days ... it was ugly and painful . I decided to stop trusting advertising and went on buying every treatment available out there . I finally found one that REALLY helped me ... Campho-Phenique . It burns , but it dries out my sores in just one to two days day . I finally decided to write a review because two cold sores popped up last night , and they are gone tonight ... they never had to opportunity to completely come out , and they are now dry .	-1
Why would someone pay this ? Something is wrong with all the prices on Pepcid Complete ! I can buy 100 at my local grocery store for $ 10 . Even if it 's PRIME , who would pay it ? The product itself is great , although the cherry is better .	-1
These antacids work great . Better than the little pills . Better than Maalox , Rolaids , or Tums . But WTH ? ! ? My husband ordered these . 4 bottles plus shipping came to $ 190.29 ? ! ? That 's not right ! I think he must have thought he was ordering 12 total , or something like that . Gon na return these . They 're cheaper at the local grocery store !	-1
This review is not about this specific item but a warning before you order . I received another Osteo Bi-Flex product with only 375 mg of Chondroitin Complex , not the 1288 mg that this product contains . I 'm having some knee pain again , so it may be that the I 'm missing the chondroitin effect . This happened before when I ordered an Osteo Bi-Flex product on Amazon , so beware . I should have returned the substitute item instead of giving it a chance .	-1
I never have had a problem swallowing pills , however , these tablets are extremely difficult to swallow and scrape the throat . They are not coated which I think may cause the problem .	-1
I love this product..have been using it for years , especially liked when they added the 2000 IU of D3 . But check out the new ingredients . The Joint Shield with 5-Loxin used to be 1288 mg but now with the 33 % smaller caplets they reduced the Joint Shield to just 375 mg.I called the company about this and they admitted they changed the formula sooooooo ... if you want the old formula of the 1288 mg. Joint Shield you 'll now have to buy it without the 2000 IU of Vitamin D3 , they no longer make that formula . I had to purchase Vitamin D separately because of this new change.I bought the smaller caplets before I realized they changed the formula . Pretty sneaky of them to do this without advising their customers . If I did n't like this product so much I would switch brands .	-1
After the first day of using this product , I began getting headaches ; especially in the back of the head and neck.These headaches increased in strength & duration with each day of use until finally , after 1 week , I had to stop using them.The headaches became debilitating.As soon as I stopped taking the product , the headaches stopped.One month later I decided to try Osteo Bi-Flex and the EXACT same thing happened , again.Now , I was sure the headaches were due to the product , in my situation.Other people seem to have a good response , unfortunately , I did not.I felt I should report my experience with Osteo Bi-Flex.Plus , I had NO pain relief at all from this product .	-1
I dislike these very much compared to any other Gillette razor refill I 've ever tried . They seem dull right out of the box , and by the second use , they 're ready for the trash .	-1
I 've been using the Venus Divine for years but the replacement blades were out of stock at my store of choice so I had to downgrade to the basic Venus blades ( all Venus blades work on all handles ) . I figured it was a couple bucks cheaper and probably just as good . Maybe I 'd save some money in the long run.Unfortunately , I wo n't be saving any money . Although both blades have the same shape and 3 blades , regular Venus blades cut me up without fail . Sometimes I would n't even notice and I 'd find blood on my white towels or sheets . I noticed a major increase in irritation and even had some bumps become infected . Even my lower legs , which have always been the easiest place for me to get a perfect shave felt rough after using these blades . I 'd always find patches I missed later , too.I always use a very high quality shaving cream to reduce irritation but even it ca n't compete with the amateur performance of Venus blades and I can tell you exactly why . Regular Venus blades do not have the comfort coating , smoothing cushions or multiple moisture strips of the Divine . In my book , those features are definitely worth paying more .	-1
This product is tolerable ( if you make with cream for those on Atkins , or milk instead of water as is suggested for those not ) , but it is $ 10- $ 12 cheaper at the grocery store . It is a little grainy , the flavor is a bit off . Actually , it tastes like many of these items taste - not great . But , it does supply you with additional protein and is n't loaded with sugar .	-1
got this as I am doing the Atkins diet . Tastes horrible . Really horrible . I threw it out . I purchased low carb isopure-tasted much better but does cost a bit more too ...	-1
I was looking for an inexpensive replacement to some of the high-protein powders I was buying and/or the pre-made muscle milk/atkins drinks I 'd get . This did n't work out so well for me . First off , with water , I did not like the taste/texture at all . I gave it a try with milk and I ended up getting sick . That could have had more to do with drinking milk first thing in the morning , but either way it was an unpleasant start to my work day . I subsequently went and tried Muscle Milk powder which I like a lot better . It 's more expensive , but it 's worth it compared to this stuff .	-1
THIS BRUSH IS A WASTE OF MY MONEY BECAUSE IT DOESNT REACH FAR BACK INTO MY MOUTH W/O ME HAVING TI GAG AND BRUSHING LEAVES MY TONGUE RED AND BLEEDING SO I WOULDNT RECOMMEND IT .	-1
Just another product with a different name to use a toothpaste . Just buy a tube of mint toothpaste would be the same .	-1
The container/dispenser is poorly designed and these wipes do n't dispense properly - when a wipe is pulled out , the top of the next wipe rarely comes through the opening , requiring one to open the top and re-feed the wipe each time . This causes the liquid to dry out rather quickly .	-1
This toothpaste did not whiten my teeth after about 2 weeks of use there as no differenceone two three	-1
It barely works . Does n't cut well at all . Not a good investment . Replaced it with a $ 15 Conair trimmer and am much happier .	-1
While it does a good job of trimming the hair , it is REALLY bad about yanking the hair and catching my skin . I always have a bloody mess whenever I tried to use this . Just not for me .	-1
This was useless for me unless I took the guard off of it . I could n't get it to work at all with the guard on so I am returning it .	-1
This was just too big for what I wanted . I wanted something that would trim my bikini area and I really dont know how anyone could use this to trim that area . Just didnt work for me .	-1
It 's ineffective , it cuts you , and it went in the trash . I know this is n't a lengthy and descriptive review on the ways it did n't work , the cuts it inflicted , and/pr what sort of trashcan it met its end in , but I think in this case , less is more . Do n't waste your money .	-1
Seriously , the first listed inactive ingredient is `` Fragrance '' . The smell is so overpowering that my gf who gets migraines could n't be in the same house the night before or day of my surgery . Why ca n't there be a fragrance-free version ? Especially considering god knows what chemicals are in those fragrances that were surely still on my skin when I got cut open .	-1
I bought this per my doula 's recommendation to wash myself in order to pass my strep b test since I am pregnant . Unfortunately it did n't work , thus I do n't recommend it . I was very hopeful and I used it as directed per my doula and other internet websites . I am strep b positive and will have to get penicillin while on labor . Do n't waste your $ .	-1
I bought the same strength pills from a different manufacturer for $ 15 and they work a lot better . Nutramax claims they use higher quality ingredients and so on but even two pills a day did not do anything for my joints . One pill from the $ 15 ( nature way ) makes a substantial difference .	-1
I tried this after reading all the fabulous reviews on here . But I am impatient when it comes to my mobility- people seem to take that for granted . I do n't have the tolerance or moxie to wait around for something to work . Maybe if I was elderly , but I am young and I feel like I am imprisoned in this useless body.Anyway , sorry for the diatribe , but yea , I took Cosamin for a few weeks , and it did nothing for me , well I lie . It did raise my blood sugars a bit , but I am willing to trade off on high blood sugars for my mobility.The absolute best things for joints is Zymosine and Flexcin . But if you are allergic to shellfish or have diabetes , I would probably stay away from them .	-1
This stuff did n't work for me , plain and simple . I do n't seem to have any problems with shoes , other than my Sperry Loafers.I started using sneaker balls ... problem solved .	-1
I read the reviews that the vibrations were too strong and still bought it . It only has two speeds and low makes me go numb .	-1
This product is a knock off . I previously stated that it was a good product but have since then changed my mind . A friend of mine has a REAL Hitachi magic wand and it is way better than this . The weight is much lighter than a REAL Hitachi magic wand and it just does not have the power . After experiencing the real deal this is a disappointment .	-1
if you want to say it has the name you would be right . tried to save a buck and ended up with what does seem to be a hitachi fraud . I gave the shibari good reviews it turned out to be junk . this is built just like the Chinese clone . motor not as big head comes off and if your going to copy the better one try making the buttons work down and up not up and up . hitachi is the best massager and even though prices went up its good to pay for the one and original . not Chinese clones . my original hitachi lasted about 5 yrs this one will likely be the same as the shibari ... burned out after a month ... .gave it two stars just because it worked and I hate sending things back !	-1
So I ca n't review it and its performance because I never switched it on . . . however , after reading the reviews and becoming concerned about this not being authentic , I did some research on this product and discovered that making knock-offs of it seems to be big business ! I went to a local store where they sell these for about twice the price . They told me they get these particular devices directly from Hitachi . Though I did not remove the one I received from its plastic , I can say that the box is almost identical to the one in store . . . but it took me about 5 seconds to assess this device as a knock-off . The switch is different in feel , function , shape and color , the device is possibly an entire pound lighter than the one in the store , the head is a different shape and feel ; the foam head is larger and removable possibly even made of a different material . . . and it is made in China . Original Hitachi Magic Wands are made in Japan . I ca n't speak for its performance . It may very well be worth half the price . . . may even be a bargain for that matter , but , selling a knock-off product with the same box and assuming the same name is false advertising . This is NOT the Hitachi everyone raves about lasting for 10+ years . . . it 's a bummer that I 'll probably just go back to that store and pay double . . . but I want the one that lasts for 10 years . I want to write an insane review like the hilarious ones I 've read . I do n't want to own the knock-off that I have read people 's complaints about breaking in a matter of weeks . I do n't mind spending the shipping or whatever is needed to return it . I do n't want to own it period . . . or even give it to anyone else to use .	-1
I bought this in September , and by May it was broken . I only used it occasionally , so it 's not like there was excessive use . Considering its price , I would have expected it to last several years , not several months .	-1
I was very disappointed with this item . The various vibration points seem to be effective , but the hand-held controller is not very user friendly : it 's just clumsy the way the buttons are set up . The size of the entire cushion is a bit on the small size and it really does not reach the neck and misses key parts of the back . Finally , and worse of all , is the small heat pad surface ( only about 6x10 in ) with the unexpected and very disappointing feature that the heating is pressure activated . While I would expect that meant that one has to sit against the pad to draw some localized heat , I could never feel any heat coming from the pad ( with the controller asking for heat ) . While the price is good , the performance and its not meeting my expectations led me to return the item immediately .	-1
Received this item twice when first was broke . Second was broke in exactly the same spot . Poor construction and can not be used properly with a Lazy Boy recliner . Straps are too short .	-1
Not comfortable to sit on . Massage does not feel good . Do n't waste your money . Get a better quality massage cushion . It was cheap , and it shows .	-1
It 's not all that I expected : the heat does n't seem to ever even get warm . The heat is timed for nine minutes , and after that time I still do n't feel any warmth on my back ( it is n't designed to warm the thighs ) . I bought this , expecting a warm massage , but it does n't deliver on that expectation . The massage is at several specific points . As long as that is what you expect , it 's fine . Do n't expect the effect that you get from the ones that have moving rollers - the roller types cover a larger area , and are more to my liking . But this unit 's massage is okay , since it 's what I expected when I went in . I just wish the heat was at least warm .	-1
This is the WORST massage cushion I have ever had . It 's not because the massage functions are bad or that the heat sucks , no those were great ... when they worked.I got this for Christmas , So I have had it only a little over 1 month.Day 3 the display screen stops working ... . annoying but I figure I can use it without it.Week 2 the bottom seat vibrators stop working ... arghh , what next ? Week 4 The remote starts to completely crap out on me , seat shuts off on it 's own after 4-5 minutes , display flickers and it won turn on correctly without holding the buttons down.I take good care of my stuff , it 's never suffered abuse or been dropped . This piece of crap isnt built to last , not for the price . I asked for a slightly more expensive one this time ( it cost $ 50 ) and it 's worthless , my Homedics one cast half as much and last 2 years of everyday use . : (	-1
Did n't help at all . None . Nada . Nothing . Complete waste of money . I do not recommend this product for any reason .	-1
My husband snores like a a freight train and this product did n't do anything to change/eliminate his snoring . Please do not bother wasting your money .	-1
No change in the snoring and probably a little too expensive for me to continue trying.My guess is that if it works for some people , they change another habit .	-1
It felt really cold on the skin . It just does not conduct body temp as well as silicone . Then it dried out and felt sticky and not in a good way .	-1
Absolutely hated it ! I thought it was odorless but it is not , it smells like some harmful organic solvent , definitely not unpleasant.The 5 stars comments say that it never gets sticky , this is simply NOT true ! I rubbed it on my palm for very short amount of time ( less than 30 secs ) and not only it got really sticky , it dried up COMPLETELY ( I used like a bit more than toothpaste size ) .NOT recommended ... .I 'm sure there are better lubs out there	-1
okay today i got this lube , and i am like lets give it a quick try , this thing dry so fast unbeleiveable , plus it makes ur skin so sticky , i added water worked for about 10 sec then dries again quick , so i am like lets stick with just the water lol.. but ya this product sucks , i ordered it just because it was high rated and i guess the only people who put it in high rated were the ones who owns the brand ... so my $ 9.48 went right down to the trash ...	-1
I thought I was ordering Freeman Bare Foot Pumice Scrub but got this instead , so I am disappointed . ( I already had 2 of these and did n't know this is what I was getting . ) It 's not as good as Pretty Feet , just cheaper .	-1
I fell into the hupe as well . Seemed real appealing to throw away the mop and bucket and have something that would clean faster and more effectively.Then I got my Floormate . I found out that cleaning with the Floormate was extremely time consuming . It takes twice as long to clean with a Floormate as it does with a mop and bucket.Do yourself a favor save the money and get a Swiffer , you will be glad you did !	-1
I followed all the directions with regard to first vaccuming the floor to pick up the dry surface dirt . My tile is a smooth surface but it has little dips , gentle little dips . It simply does not clean the floor easily or quickly . A string mop does the job much better ! The brushes do not touch the low dips on the surface of the tile , nor do they touch the grouted area . It is very easy to see that those low places and the grout remain perfectly dry ! ! How one can wet mop a floor when it partly remains dry is beyond me ! For tiles that had obvious dirty areas such as dirt clinging to dried drips , it took me no less than 20 forward and backward movements to get that one tile clean . This is more work than using a string mop . To wash my floor would require much repetitive motion which is not good for the wrists ( carpal tunnel syndrome ) .I feel the claims made on the TV commercial are not at all the reality that I experienced . It did such a horrible job at mopping the floor I aborted the task and got out the string mop immediately.As I said , I have had much better luck with a broom and then my old fashioned Fuller string mop . I have had success with the Black and Decker ScumBuster to really scrub at grout , which I do on a semi-annual basis . To boot the Scum Buster does other more useful tasks such as cleaning small places like the tiles in the shower , and has many different attachments and different types of sponges to choose from.I thought the H3000 would be a more hands-free way to mop ( hands would stay dry and clean ) . I also was under the impression from multiple reviews here at Amazon.com that this device does a great job scrubbing grout . Not the case with my floor ! Honestly the string mop removes the dirt on the top of the tile and in the grout , on one or two passes , while the Hoover H3000 took 20 passes and cleaned only the topmost parts of the tile ( and no grout ) ! I highly suggest you read through many reviews before buying this product . Unfortunatly I only read a few that were at the top which were all 5 star reviews.The H3000 is also top-heavy when full of liquid , getting ready to mop . I followed the directions by first filling it with the cleansing solution then using it as a dry vac . I found that at this point it was light on the bottom but top-heavy on the handle due to the full liquid-container . The instructions also say you must use this one type of Lysol cleanser . I seriously question this as I have never seen this product in the store . I also prefer to use an all-natural product on my floor , Citrasolv . I have no idea whether that is `` allowed '' with this machine . Since I am returning it I do n't have to ponder that anymore.The instruction manual does n't address at all the issue of the brushes not making full contact with the floor . I think this needs to be redesigned so that the brush heads float up and down to accommodate change in floor height such as the dip where the grout is vs. top of the tile . I was told by the Hoover customer service rep that I spoke with on the phone that to make better contact , to remove the front piece that sucks up the water , although that would disable the drying and sucking up water function . I tried it and saw no difference ! I am very disappointed with this expensive product that did n't live up to its ' claims .	-1
My skin is so dryand my throat is dry tooI purchased this thingto dampen the twoit runs and it runsbut nowhere I seeany sign of the hu-mi-di-ty	-1
When the item came , the batteries were already dead . I ran to the drugstore to buy new batteries , but the store did n't carry the correct kind . Even if they did , we could not get the battery cover off . It says to just use a coin , but we did that and all it did was strip the plastic . Both my husband and I tried with various tools , but we could n't open the battery cover . We 'll keep trying , but right now it 's basically a big waste of money .	-1
The main reason this thermometer got 1 star was because it lasted about 20 uses in less than a month and now the thing beeps real long at me when I try to use it . The battery is dying already ! Also , the backlight does n't last long enough for me to actually see the measurement taken.The recall information was not there 50 % of the time when I turned it back on.It takes temperatures quick , but that 's about it . Please do n't waste your money on this .	-1
I do n't know what compelled me to buy a three pack of this stuff . I guess I 'm just a sucker for bulk-purchase bargains . I now have 2.8 bottles of Nair that I will never use.I attempted using this to get rid of hair on my chest and abdomen . I followed all the instructions and ended up with stubble anywhere ( like a really bad shave ) and mild burns all over my skin . I was red all over and had little pindrops of blood here and there . Still , I waited a few days and tried again , and again saw no results ( except , of course , for more irritated skin ) . This is worse than simply shaving where you want the hair removed . And it 's not that I have very thick hair either . I 'm Asian , and my hair is fine and thin everywhere . If this ca n't truly & # 34 ; remove & # 34 ; my hairs , it most definitely wo n't remove them from , say , a hairier Middle Eastern man . Save your money and buy an epilator . Takes a few minutes to do a mildly-hairy torso and you actually pull the hairs out , root and all .	-1
I hate hair on my chest so got this . It didn & # 8217 ; t work ! ! ! I had to use it 3 times before it took all the hair off any I & # 8217 ; m not even a hairy person . Very disappointed with this product as I expected more .	-1
Let this be a warning ! Do n't waste your money ! You are better off with a razor and shaving cream.The stuff stinks too , I used some on my chest hair , and left it on longer than the time the instuctions said , nothing happened ! In a nut shell , do n't waste your time , and money on this junk !	-1
As reported for the Energizers I purchased at Amazon , I found these Duracell batteries at an online pharmacy called hocks which had them much cheaper and with my other items had no shipping or tax either . If you have only an order for a battery and will get stuck with shipping , then these prices might be OK , but if you order anything else over some limit ( $ 75 ? ? ) , then the hocks place will ship free and if I remember right it was $ 1.69 for TWO of these batteries in one package ! Ca n't beat that price .	-1
This might be the worst shaving product I have ever used . Normally I like to used a badger brush + Tabac soap , but due to new living conditions I am unable to travel with those items . I bought this hoping for it to be better than most other commercial gels/creams , but I was wrong . I think I would take a can of that Barbasol foam before I used this again . Beard needs to be incredibly short for this filmy soap to work . If you wait for than a day in between shaves , much tugging and pulling will occur.STAY AWAY !	-1
I bought this based on the claim that it helps to prevent bumps , irritation , and ingrown hairs . I 've suffered with all of those throughout my adult life . This product goes on nice and smooth and it is n't foamy or thick , which is fine with me . It seems to form a nice barrier between the razor and skin , but in actuality it does not . I still end up with several cuts and many ingrown hairs . I gave this a good , thourough test by using 3 tubes over several months and trying it with different brands of razors . I saw zero improvement in my complexion . Also , as one reviewer already wrote , this cream does clog the razor very much and that is frustrating.I was really hopeful this product would help me more , but after 3 tubes I can say I wo n't be buying anymore .	-1
Now granted this is good marketing , and it makes people feel better.It 's all natural . That 's a plus.Unfortunately study after study has shown it does n't work so well ... I mean , let 's face it , it 's an emulsifier and some oils . It does add grapefruit seed extract , which is a natural anti-fungal but likely those who buy this are not simply trying to remove fungus , but instead the typical residues found on fruits and veggies.And we all know how important it is to get all the pesticides off your food right ? This is kind of a joke in the cooking world but I still tried it out , because sometimes I love things that are a joke and I also wanted to see what was in it and look at how it worked.My apples were still waxy . I can tell artificial wax on an apple . But we want clean likely more than anything ... so do n't take my word for it : One university study found that distilled water was equally if not more effective in removing microbes such as bacteria and mold . Another study at Tennessee State University also found that water worked as well as the vegetable wash tested.It 's funny but I have had this for awhile and had forgotten my own review until I watched another news study on TV debunk myths and used this as an example of playing on the consumer fears.But in the event you do n't wish to just use water -- use what has been proven effective forever : half vinegar and half water ... rinse well . You can just put it in a spray bottle and mist it on . Apple cider vinegar is actually really good for you and IT will remove the pesticides and wax , unlike any oil that ensures things cling to your fruit or veggie but most cooking peeps just use plain clear distilled vinegar and water.My personal comparison found that the veggies I used the vinegar and water solution on were far cleaner looking and tasting and after a rinse , it left no residue at all . I personally use filtered water and have seen tests that show that cleaned perfectly , but if you still want that extra insurance , all roads indicate this is not it.I give it an extra star because at least it 's all natural ... it is simply too much of a gimmick that did n't do it 's job , so say both I and the experts , to give it anything more . Maybe it will help you rinse longer since you spray this one ... but that 's about it.Product provided by Citrus Magic , Review is my honest and unbiased opinion .	-1
I received this thermometer as a gift for my baby shower . I was so excited , it seemed so great and non intrusive . Well , I use it exactly how it states and it 's completely unreliable . In the instructions is even says to take your temp 3 times with it then average it out for the most accurate temp . What ? ? Who has time for that non sense when there is a baby fever emergency . My husband was really sick one day , just hot sweating buckets and ( he was sweating so I followed the sweating instructions ) and it kept telling me he was 105 degrees ... over and over . Obviously I 'm freaking out as he 's getting close to brain damage territory ... we rush him into the ER and theirs reads 101 degrees . $ 2,000 emergency room visit later ... what a waste . If it was accurate , we never would have gone in to the ER . We would have just kept cooling him down.Anyways , there is no way I would ever trust this dumb thing on my baby . There has got to be something better out there . Please learn from my experience . I 'm a very detail oriented person and trust me I was not using it wrong .	-1
I am speechless . After reading a lot of positive reviews and buying this thermometer , neither myself nor my spouse have been able to get a good reading . We both are educated people and have read the manual several times , tried to follow all the steps . One would think it should not be difficult to take the temperature reading . Each reading was different and never showed the right temperature for either my spouse or me ! Tried to use it on a healthy baby ... .but he kept moving so I could not even hold the thing next to his forehead ! ! ! I ca n't imagine using it on a sick baby who probably has no patience and totally cranky . I am shopping now for a thermometer that actually is easy to use	-1
Im sure it is a great product but despite reading instructions I ca n't seem to get the same reading on temp twice . Really wish I can return it but apparently I only had 30 days to do so .	-1
This was the first glucose meter I ever purchased and I originally thought I was getting a useful tool to monitor my blood sugar levels . It frequently read in the 80-85 range for fasting level and I thought I was doing great until I went back for my lab test . A few minutes before the test I used the meter and it displayed a level of 80 . When I got my lab test result , however , it was 97 ! Although this is within the 20 % tolerance range required by all consumer meters , it was virtually worthless in providing a way to reliably measure levels below 100 - which is what I was primarily after . On the only positive note , I did find the skin prick device to work very reliably and consistently . In fact , I still use this one for the skin prick even though I never use the meter any longer for glucose testing . I now use only the Freestyle Freedom Lite meter for testing my blood sugar . In 3 verifications against lab testing , the Freedom Lite was off by only 1 , 6 and 2 points . That 's better than 6 % accuracy !	-1
My husband has been using this twice a day , for several weeks . We see no improvement on his beige teeth . He does n't smoke , or drink alochol , yet his teeth are beige . I was really hoping this toothpaste would work , based on all the reviews . We 're not impressed so far , but he will continue to use it until the tube is gone .	-1
This product seemed to work ... but only if you DO N'T drink wine or coffee or smoke again EVER ! .My teeth looked whiter , literally ... but then seemed more susceptible to staining ... and got worse and worse ... It was totally weird . I will never buy this product again.I 'll stick with my Neways/Modere more natural stuff .	-1
This was an expensive experiment , that turned into a failure . I am a wine/tea/coffee drinker and chronic blueberry smoothie consumer , so my teeth could use some lightening and brightening . I used this toothpaste exclusively for the past 6 months ( with a sonicare ) and exactly as directed ( with a dry toothbrush ) and noticed no change whatsoever . It functions as toothpaste , in that it cleaned my teeth , but they are definitely not any whiter than when I started .	-1
It does the trick but synthetic cover keeps coming off and it 's a light blue color ( I ordered and expected green/blue pled ) .It might be a good heating pad for a shoulder or a lower back but for my ankle it was too short to wrap around and it would not stay in place . Main reason why it was hard to use ( again ) was the cover that kept slipping off .	-1
I 'm surprised Amazon is selling this low quality item . If you read the reviews on the King size pad with the same features , it 's more accurate . This did not get warm enough even on high . I used it exactly two times over a two day period and then it died . It 's not worth the warranty fee of $ 5.00 plus the postage to return it to Homedics . Pure junk .	-1
not what i thought it would be . cheap and plastic and breaks easy . not that special of a thing for me	-1
I bought this at CVS about 5 years ago after seeing it featured on a TV show . Someone reminded me of it recently , so I decided to share my experience . I 've been using a Mach 3 razor for many years to shave my head , and I think it works just fine . I tried this thing , and immediately noticed that there was no easy way to tap the hair out of it . It got clogged with hair and there was no leverage to tap the hair out like there was with a normal shaped razor like the Mach 3 . It just got clogged up . I returned it to CVS . Useless compared to the Mach 3 . End of story .	-1
To be very honest , I only post negative experiences with products since it is my belief that when one purchases a product good quality should be a given . I own TWO of these units , which are model WP-65W , essentially the very same unit as the 60W . All of the negative issues already posted , such as the motor seizing , have been experienced by me . I am posting this review because China has come to earn a very negative reputation for producing inferior quality , just read the newspapers . On the other hand , WATERPIK is responsible for the specifications on these products . I use these units because I have gum disease and daily use helps me . There seems not to be much of a choice in the marketplace just now .	-1
It 's so sad when august American companies , whose products had ruled the world since WWII , nowadays export their manufacturing to China with the result being unreliable , shoddy products not only such as this one , but also with `` prestigious name '' combination padlocks I bought that failed and numerous other shoddy Chinese products .	-1
What a terrible product ! It broke literally in 5 minutes of normal use . The screw snapped off inside of one of the heads and one of the heads fell off . I did n't want to gamble on a replacement . I tried to save some money by getting an inexpensive one but you get what you pay for I guess . I 'll save up for a brookstone instead .	-1
More of a tickler than a cutter it left a lot to be desired in results . It also only lasted about a year	-1
I only used it a couple of times and then it stopped working . Given this is a really simple device , maybe that 's why it 's so inexpensive .	-1
... . which was not very long at all . As a nose trimmer that was operable , it cut very cleanly and without much irritation . The motor on this device however , decided it wanted to quit far too soon . No motor , no trimmer .	-1
I have had a previous model panasonic trimmer , but it gave up the ghost and I had to replace it . So I went with another Panasonic.My old Panasonic did n't hurt . Its blades were configured to hit the hairs at a more right angle , cutting cleanly and quickly . Hairs could only enter the cutting zone of the head on the SIDES of the cutter , not on the tip.This ( reviewed ) unit allows hairs to enter the END of the cutter , where they are TWISTED out of your skin . It hurts like crazy - and I 'm highly pain tolerant . I think they must have done it to make the tip smaller . But it 's a totally ineffective compromise . It made my eyes water and started an insane sneezing fit . Entertaining for my wife , yes , but this thing is no good . Not even worth returning - this is hitting the trash can .	-1
It 's a flimsy plastic trimmer that does n't have any good qualities aside from the cheap price tag . You 're better off spending an extra $ 5 on `` MANGROOMER Essential Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer '' here on Amazon . My husband has n't had any complaints with that one so far .	-1
I had this type of Panasonic trimer for several years . I decided to get a new one , but it was n't working from day one . I got another one . It worked for a few days , and then stopped working . I was surprised that a Panasonic product would be this defective . IF it is working , it works great .	-1
When it worked , this compact trimmer did a good job . Unfortunately the motor died after a few months . The trimmer first developed problems with starting , where it would take a few taps on the housing to get the motor going . Performance deteriorated until it finally refused to start at all . The motor reminds me of the cheap DC motors used in model planes , that fail after minimal use . Maybe I got a lemon , but this trimmer was a total disappointment . It is cheap , so if it does die , at least you wo n't lose too much .	-1
I took this as the first step in a prep for surgery , and my experience may have been rougher because I was also on a liquid diet . In any case , it was anything but gentle . It was about the same as any other surgical prep purgative.With medical stuff , you have to do what you have to do . But except for medical need , I would not take this product under any circumstances .	-1
These a overpriced in my opinion ; more over thy dosages of actual eye nutrients is pretty low for something sold specifically for eye health .	-1
Update - Here is what I think is the best way to use this type of epilator . After you 've used it for a while your hair grows in softer and softer . Eventually the hairs are so soft they get broken off instead of pulled out . If you return to shaving for a few weeks the hairs will grow in stiffer and stiffer . At that point you can go back to using the epilator because it will grab and pluck out the new stiff growth . The only downside is that you will experience something close to the original first time use pain when you start up with the epilator again . But after two or three sessions the pain is not longer an issue.Original review : I 've owned two Emjoi epilators , one was corded and one was cordless . Neither lasted more than a couple of years so when my last one quit I thought I 'd try a different brand . For me this Braun works much better on my legs than the Emjoi models . I have fine hair and the Emjoi missed most of it so I had to go back over and over an area many times to get all the hairs out . This Braun gets more hair with each pass and I think it has to do with the guard - it has tiny teeth that must lift the hairs up so the tweezers can grab them . It comes with two guards - one , for sensitive skin or beginners , has a row of tiny wheels along each edge that supposedly massage the skin making the process more comfortable . I 've been using this method of hair removal for years so did not bother trying the wheelie guard on my legs but I did try it for my underarms to see if it might hurt less . Well just as with the Emjoi I am disappointed with the results I get on my underarm area . The wheelie guard was of no use at all , it seems to me that it prevents the tweezers from reaching most of the hairs . With the regular guard it works about the same as the Emjoi but the guard falls off during the process so that 's a big nuisance . The looser skin and the concave shape of an armpit makes this type of hair removal very tedious . I need to find a model just for underarms , something much smaller that would reach up in there better . Anyway , that 's the only reason I withhold one star from this Braun epilator - that it did n't work great on my underarms . Otherwise it is much better than the Emjoi for my legs and unless it breaks soon I 'll stay with this brand from now on . Noise factor is about the same for both brands . I always wear soft foam ear plugs when I use anything with a noisy motor.UPDATE - the guard , the one with the ridges , will not stay in place so I 've begun to leave it off . I can do my legs just fine without a guard but found out the hard way that I can not do my underarms without a guard . Yeee-ouch ! So for underarms I put the guard on and have to try to hold it with one finger to keep it from coming off . This makes doing underarms ever more difficult but with patience I do get the job done.Another update - I have noticed that hair on my legs grows back much faster with this epilator than it did with the Emjoi and I think it 's because this epilator mostly breaks the hairs off rather than pull them out . So instead of the hair having to totally grow back in it only has to return to its previous length .	-1
This product breaks off hairs , which may make the hair be gone for a day or two , but then stubble will return , and when you try to remove the stubble , turns out it 's not long enough for removal . For the price you 're paying , proceed at your own risk and most likely dissapointment .	-1
I gave this razor two stars because it does work sort of . However , I bought it because there were reviews from women who said it was better than the Venus . I had the VenusGillette for Women Venus Divine Razorand thought somehow the Mach would be better . But it feels awful in my hands . I know that sounds ridiculous as it 's just a razor , but the Venus does feel a lot less slippery and just more viscerally pleasant and easier to hold . I felt like I could cut myself easier with the Mach . It just felt creepy to me . I gave it to my husband .	-1
Funny because I had a mach 3 for a long time , and I love it to death.I decided to go ahead and try the new razor . I bought this from Walmart . Very strange , indeed . This has never happened before . Is the Mach 3 supposed to be dull for a faster shape ? maybe they used dull blades so people can shave fast without cuts ? Or I just got a bad package.I decided to go ahead and do this review for amazon because I saw there were a lot of reports of dull blades upon purchase . I just want to let people know that I was one of them , but mine are definitely real . It seems possible that Gillette may be letting go of some of their quality.Sorry all but the blades suck . Just because you did n't think so , does n't mean mine were n't dull . This is a crappy A razor . You can go you know what .	-1
I bought this for myself after reading only good reviews here , on amazon . I was so disappointed.I 'm used to using Gillette Pro Glide , and therefore i 'm used to the nice , smooth feeling of the razor.This felt like i was dropped in a pool or razorblades from an airplane . Just scratching my skin and cutting it all over.I dumped this thing ASAP.I do not recommend this .	-1
Unfortunately , it compresses down to 1/2 inch or so pretty quickly . Other wedges are better .	-1
The cushion was fair for about a month but became flat as a pancake . I weigh about 165 but there is no guarantee that it would last longer even for anyone substantially lighter . I definitely would not have bought this had I known it would become worthless in such a short time .	-1
This cushion is hard , so hard it feels like a piece of hard foam . I tried it once and that was enough for me to not use it again . It is a shame as I really need it and was desperate to make it work . To be fair , if you use a hard chair , it might work for you . If your chair has some kind of cushion , do n't waste your money as , again , this cushion is HARD .	-1
After one week of using this Cushion there was no more support for anything . I was sadly disappointed . Did n't have the box to return it . Do n't purchase this pillow . : (	-1
It is gel-like and squishy and is too soft to provide support or height . I 'll try a firm in a different brand .	-1
bought this and another brand at same time..this thing went flat fairly quickly , little support ... one of the worse purchases I ever made.. see my reviews for the ther brand ... much better .	-1
I have degenerative disc disease with back pain and spasms ; so when I buy pillows or cushions I am looking for something to give good , strong support , and this pillow offered a cushioned seat with cut-out to allow the spine to elongate to prevent pain . I also bought the pillow because it is portable and I intended to take it everywhere and use it when no other comfortable seating was available . However , I was greatly disappointed in this product . It does not keep a cushion and the pillow flattens out so you do n't feel like you 're sitting on a pillow at all . I gave it 2 stars because of the cut-out for the spine but all-in-all , the pillow was a let-down . No support whatsoever ! Very disappointing . I would not recommend .	-1
I use mine in an LED booklight for my Kindle ( AAA ) and in the Wii Mote for the kids ( AA ) . I 've only used the AAA about 5 times and each time they hold the charge less and less . Last night I put 3 freshly charged AAA in myBelkin Clip-On Reading Light for Kindle ( White ) [ Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging ] and it did n't even go THREE HOURS until it dimmed to where I could n't see . Unbelievable.I can get cheap AAA batteries at the dollar store - and they at least LAST . I 've had better luck with the Energizer rechargable AA batteries lasting a bit longer and holding a charge a bit more but these AAA ones are just the ultimate in craptastic.Save your money . Chose a different brand !	-1
After using this product continously for 14 days , I did not see any difference in color of my teeth . $ 25 down the drain .	-1
my teeth hurt so bad after i used this stuff . i could n't even finish using the whole thing , the searing tooth pain was awful ! ! ! ! it was horrible pain i never want to feel again . and my teeth were only a tiny bit whiter , if anything . actually they might not have been whiter at all , i think i imagined it . might work for some people w/out a problem but if you have sensitive teeth , cavities or gum disease expect some PAIN . the peroxide really gets in there & chews up the nerves . ouch !	-1
This is a poorly designed product . Once the strips are in your mouth , not only can you not eat , drink , or speak -- you can not even move your tongue ! If it bumps the strip , the strip crinkles , and soon you only have a balled-up piece of plastic stuck to one tooth . I used over half the box , and only one time did they stay secured the full half hour they are supposed . Were my teeth whiter ? No . They just caught the sun better with those little bits of clear plastic stuck in between them .	-1
Swimming : I took up swimming in the pool as exercise for my back and someone suggested these silicone ear plugs to prevent water going into your ears in the swimming pool.These ear plugs did not prevent water going into my ears . The ear plugs that work well for me are these Aqua Sphere conical swimmers ear plugs.Noise : My significant other snores , so I 've become an expert on ear plugs.I have tried quite a few of them and Mack 's earplugs are among them . Below is a summary of my experiences with different ear plugs . I hope you will find it useful . Other than the noise protection , the important factors for me are if the plugs stay in my ear , and if they are breathable ( some earplugs make my ear canals hot and sweaty , that makes them itch , and then itching wakes me up ) . * Mack 's pillow soft earplugs ( silicone ) , 22 decibels . These earplugs did not work for me at all . They did not provide enough sound protection , my ear canal got hot and sweaty and itchy ( and needing to itch wakes me up ) , and they also tend to fall out . * Hearos ear plugs , ultimate softness , 32 decibels . Hearos have a good size , not too long not too short . They are slightly shorter than Flent Quiet time , so they do n't stick out of my ear , and this means they do n't catch the pillow and do n't get pulled out . They are also slightly softer , and provide a little less protection . Overall they are comfortable , but I find that my ears get hot and sweaty using them . * Hearos ear plugs , Xtreme protection Series , 33 decibels . Hearos are slightly shorter than Flents Quiet time , so they do n't stick out of my ear , and thus stay in better . They are firmer than Hearos ultimate softness so they provide more noise protection . Overall they are comfortable , but I find that my ears get hot and sweaty using them . * Flents Quiet Contour , molded foam , 33 decibels.This is my favorite ear plug . It gives me the best noise protection , it stays in the ear very well , it is comfortable , my ear canal does not get hot and itchy . I find the most comfortable . * Flents Quiet Time , comfort foam , 33 decibels . I like these earplugs less than Quiet Contour because it does not seem to stay in my ear as well . The ends of the foam seem to stick out and catch on the pillow when I turn , catching the end on the pillow pulls them out of my year . I got it to stay in the ear better by trimming about 3/8th of an inch . Because they tend to fall out , I do n't get as good of a sleep in them . However , when they are in the sound protection is good . ( see attached photo of the full size ear plug , and the one that is trimmed to be shorter ) For me Flents Contour ear plugs win on all counts - noise protection , comfort , staying , breathability.Ali Julia review	-1
When I tried these ( for nighttime wear ) I was not impressed with the sound resistance or the fit . I really hated how oily they felt , and when I got up in the morning they left a residue on my ear .	-1
Hardly what I expected . Trying to fit one of these to my ear is ridiculous .	-1
These make excellent play-doh for your little neices and nephews but as earplugs I found them bitterly disappointing . As bitterly disappointing as an earplug can be , that is . Yes , they are soft and can conform to the interior of your ear , but all they do is muffle sound ; in no way did they drown out the annoying cacophony of my neighbor who likes to start his parties at one in the morning . Perhaps they are better for higher-pitched sounds that do n't have much bass in them , but they did n't save me any sleep .	-1
in my humble & limited experience , I was not impressed with them:1 ) they do not stay in my ear2 ) in order to get them to seal , one has to put some pressure on it , which causes discomfort in the earI found myself abandoning these after just 2 swims b/c I spent the whole time trying to get them to stay in . For an alternative , cMack 's AquaBlock Earplugs , 2 prheck out the AquaBlock ear plugs , also from Mack . I had much better success with them .	-1
The quality of the trim is so bad that I had to throw this away and switch to a Braun shaver.The customer service is also horrible . I submitted my rebate form for refund but the never send me anything .	-1
I have been replacing the blades on my Norwood for a couple of years , the ha8 's seem to go dull every 6 month or so . I have decided to try another razor as the cost of replacement the blades is about the same as a news mid priced razor .	-1
Maybe it was my razor , but it seems like these blades were dull out of the package . They were no more effective than the old ones I replaced .	-1
Buyer be aware . Like several others , I was enticed by the excellent price . While the box might say HQ8 the head covers did not fit into my Norelco razor that was also bought ( twice ) from Amazon . Something is wrong ! I 've subsequently found other reviewers with the same complaint . I tried for nearly an hour to twist and turn these new head covers to fit into the three holes from the cutting blades . THEY DID NOT FIT AND COULD NOT BE MADE TO FIT . I followed the solution of others , removed the the cutting blades from their covers and used the old head cover with the new blades inserted into them . I have no idea if these are fake copies of Norelco product , or if a new factory did not follow specs . But `` Something is rotten in Denmark '' , albeit this is a supposed reputable company in the Netherlands . I now question my second purchase of the original Norelco shaver that I bought as a gift for my new grandson-in-law . This flaw in replacements parts will seriously impact my purchase of another Norelco product ... ..frustration ! ! ! The advertised picture shows a total new razor top containing the blades , but what you receive are three blades with their head covers sealed in a plastic box . Surprised ! Yes . Disappointed and frustrated they do not fit . A label HQ8 means nothing if they are not the real thing .	-1
Maybe because I am fairly new at all of this but it was really hard to get at the right temp and keep it warm so you can actually do a leg . Sometimes it worked sometimes it go barely any hair . And I did read the instructions word for word . Not worth the money and hassel . Loved the fact that it is natural just wish it actually worked . Disappointment .	-1
Id give it a zero , but that 's not an option . I 'm & # 34 ; stuck & # 34 ; w/a product that I absolutely hate , cuz uthis ca n't b sent back . Anywho , it did n't take hardly any hair off . I did n't think id ever get the wax off & that was using hot water & soap ! Very disappointed . Read the reviews & thought , this will work great ! WRONG !	-1
After reading countless reviews I decided to buy this . Normally I just thread my facial hair but I wanted something that would last longer . Even after completely letting my facial hair and walking around looking like a complete lunatic the wax would not stick and barely removed any hair . I gave it an extra star because I really like the fact that the strips are washable . However , there is nothing special about this , you 're better off buying cheaper wax from a store it will do the same thing .	-1
does n't work and their customer service is non-existent ! awful ! it is messy , sticky , I tried everything like the box said , I google it , and still woul n't work . I got no hair out but I got some blood ! yep ! awful ! stay away !	-1
I got this product because I am a sucker for organic products . I was very excited to use it but then the first time I put the wax in the microwave for the amount of time on the directions and the wax burned me . That would n't have been much of a problem since you can just put the wax in for less time . However the wax itseld was very sticky and messy and the strips did not work very well . Also it 's kind of nasty to wash the strips each time because you 're supposed to soak them in water and all the water and wax comes off . I prefer the strips that already have wax on them , they are much easier to use and way more effective !	-1
I have tried this afew times and followed the directions . I made sure to do everything the package said and it did not take off hardly any hair . I tried it on my face , neck , bikini area , and legs . It worked ok on my face and my legs . It took some hair off my legs but only light hairs on my face but did not take hair off anywhere else . I will try again on my legs one day when I have more time . The only plus for this product is it did not bother my skin so I will try again.Tryied again and it did not work I only got a few hairs off and red skin : (	-1
I find jar wax very annoying to use because its very messy and does n't stay warm during the entire waxing process . This wax is better the other wax products I have tried because it does n't cause breakouts and its the only one I have found that I have actually gotten to work . Regardless , I find it easier to buy the prewax strips and use those as they seem to work so much better for me everytime .	-1
As far as removing white lint from dark clothing , cotton sweats , the majik brush flat does n't work . It does n't even get close . So save your money . It does n't even deserve one starI 'm returning it out of spite even thou it will cost more than the refund I 'll get back	-1
I do n't think it 's orginal german made orall-B , becuase it comes with package that is not from Oral-B , like other think , this is freaky chinese and is not orginal ! do n't buy that .	-1
I tried these brush heads as my teeth are sensitive . First off it did not help the sensitive teeth , they were still sensitive . Second I did not feel my teeth were clean enough and soon after felt I needed to brush them again . I think they are meant more for people with sensitive gums not teeth . I had to order more of the precision clean brush heads so I could feel good about brushing my teeth .	-1
These brush heads got way too expensive . Right after I bought a package of these , the oral B toothbrush gave out . Which is just as well because the brushes seemed to be too rough on my gums . I switched to Purisonic and I 'm much happier . Plus , you get a year 's supply of brush heads .	-1
I bought two eight packs an 6 out of the pack broke within one month use . The old ones worked great . Not sure what happened but if you scan the internet you will find this is a major issue with these .	-1
Hard to believe a toothbrush head can be dangerous , but these are . I did n't know these were not built by Braun . If they are , someone really dropped the ball at the QC station . The brush heads become loose very quickly . Aside from pinching parts of your mouth in the loosened gap , they will eventually disintegrate in your mouth . I have just ordered the Braun labeled heads and hopefully , they are up to the excellent quality of the originals . These replacements however should be avoided until the quality concerns are addressed . That 's my opinion anyway .	-1
Some of the brush heads are loose right out of the pack , the others becomes loose after very little use ( 10-20 minutes of cumulative brushing time ) . When the brush heads are loose , they do n't rotate back and forth the way they are supposed to when you hold the brush head against your teeth ; they can pinch your lip or cheek , and they can come apart in your mouth . And they can even come apart in your mouth . I 've used a Braun/Oral-B since before Proctor and Gamble took over and the quality was never this poor . A bad brush head now and then but not whole packages . I 've seen knockoffs that are of this poor quality . I 've checked with Procter & Gamble ( Oral-B has been owned by P & G since 2006 ) to determine whether these are counterfeit and am convinced that they are genuine Oral-B product , just terribly poor quality Oral-B product . Perhaps when P & G took over Oral-B , they found ways to cut costs and quality has suffered as a result .	-1
I have never liked the stench of talcum powder . I hate it ! The odor of talcum makes me queasy.Even though I ca n't stand the smell , this product does a lot for preventing moisture accumulation.This is not something I would ever get for myself . This was a gift that ended up being passed along as a gift to a third party.The smell alone made this product not worth it to me . I found other products that serve this purpose that do n't smell bad.While it may have helpful properties , the smell alone repelled me .	-1
This is the crappiest mouth guard . Highly uncomfortable , way too bulky and leave your mouth open at night . It 's not that I bought the wrong size . It 's a design issue . Toss it to the trash can .	-1
This product is not ready for prime-time . What you are supposed to do is boil the protector in water and then press the scalding hot appliance into your teeth a good 3-4 millimeters . Even if you can take the heat the appliance does not get soft enough to really get your teeth in that far . The best I could manage was a & quot ; dent & quot ; in the plastic . Even if you do get your teeth into it there is so much spillover on the sides that you 'll not be able to close your mouth and you 'll wake up in a puddle of drool . So you will spend hours cutting and shaving the appliance to try to get something usable and in the end you 'll wind up just returning it for a refund .	-1
This is the early model with the soft surface , it has been improved.The Doctor 's 3 Pack Classic Night Guard Teeth Grinding ProtectionYou can not beat the price or the quality of the new style if you go to the link.The old style is easy to put a hole in during the fit and does not last long . The new style has a hard and durable surface that lasts for years , you will want to change it before it wears out to keep a fresh new one in your mouth . I recommend replacing it twice a year .	-1
Rubs sole on bikini zone and legs . Rude . Noticeable with any dress . Maybe size is wrong . I do not know but Purchase small with my 129lb per description . Do not notice any help . Will return .	-1
My second pregnancy and I developed bulging vein in my groin area . It does n't hurt but does n't look hot ; ) My doc told me about the V2 supporter and since I still have 7 weeks to go I wanted to give it a try.I 'm 5'6 '' and my measurements are : PRE pregnancy , 132 lb , pant size 6,8th months pregnant 167 lb , hips 41.5 '' , pant size-better do n't know ; ) Anyway according to sizing and reviews I ordered medium . I just took a look at it and new it 's too big and it was , even with maximum adjusting.I exchanged it for small and it was still too loose ! I could n't feel any compression . Went down to petite size and still no compression and it sits too low.Go figure ! I do n't have specific figure like very boyish or super wide hips.I took close look at the supporter and IMO it should also have adjustment straps on the hips , not only on the butt part.So good idea but questions about execution . I 'm surprised because this product has good reviews.Last note : I 'd appreciate different colors ( black and nude ) and more modern look . The lace part cracked me up everytime I was looking at the supporter.It is a XIX century jock strap lol	-1
I very much looked forward to the support of this cradle during my twin pregnancy . They do n't seem to be sized for petite women ; rather taller women with long torsos . I tried two different sizes and neither fit appropriately for me . Both fit well through the shoulders but were baggy through the middle , thus not supportive , even in late term . Alas , I returned the cradle for a full refund .	-1
Wife saw no improvement in her knees after 3 weeks . Large uncoated pills hard to swallow . Very disappointedWill not purchase again	-1
This product is stated to be made from crustaceans ( shrimp , crab , crayfish ) and not a single mention of mollusks ( mussels , clams , scallops ) . I can eat shrimp and crab all day long but get severe migraines from all mollusks in quantity ( one or two clams wo n't bother me ) . As the product lists no mention of mollusks , I figured it would be safe.I was wrong . Each dose gave me headaches . I finally gave up and switched to a plant-based source made by Solgar , also sold on Amazon . I have no issues with that product . If you are in a similar position , be cautious taking this product .	-1
I have used this twice for two years each time . I have come to the conclusion that it is useless . My husband has been a faithful user for over 8 years . I finally talked him into stop wasting our money for this supplement . It is very expensive . You can use your money for better supplements . A couple of suggestions would be - turmeric ( you can make your own capsules with organic turmeric and black pepper ) . My favorite would be astaxanthin which not only protects your joint and tendon health but also supports - eyes , skin from sun exposure , anti aging thru cellular health , immune system , cardiovascular health and also aids in recovery from exercise . I can work in the garden on a sunny day for over 2 hours and no burn whatsoever . That 's where you should put your money .	-1
These did not work for me , but i had to try them . I have tried other ones and they did not work either . Good luck .	-1
After the first day of using this product , I began getting headaches ; especially in the back of the head and neck.These headaches increased in strength & duration with each day of use until finally , after 1 week , I had to stop using them.The headaches became debilitating.As soon as I stopped taking the product , the headaches stopped.One month later I decided to try Osteo Bi-Flex and the EXACT same thing happened , again.Now , I was sure the headaches were due to the product , in my situation.Other people seem to have a good response , unfortunately , I did not.I felt I should report my experience with Osteo Bi-Flex.This product also did not relieve any arthritic joint pain for me . None .	-1
At first glance this seems like such a great product . Lots of herbs and other supplements . But if you read the small print on the back , bottom of the box ... this product contains Acesulfame Potassium , for some people a controversial artificial sweetener . You wo n't see artificial sweeteners in any health food store supplements , and it makes me question the legitimacy of this product as an herbal supplment.I would recommend instead of this product something like Alacer 's Emer'Gen-C vitamin packets . They are sweetened with fructose and naturally flavored . Or Zicam Cold Remedy.Good luck , and get well !	-1
I bought this to spray some of my fabric ballet flats , to hopefully prevent them from getting dingy as I wear them all the time . I followed the directions exactly , made sure that the materials I was trying to cover were compatible with this , and it was like I might as well had spritzed them with a water bottle and achieved the same result .	-1
These sponges are no different than the 3M sponges I am trying to replace . Turns out they are both made by 3M . The O-Cel-O sponge started tearing during the first use ! The 3M sponges lasted a week before falling apart . Those little blue chucks ( or orange in O-Cel-O 's case ) or sponge going down my drains are not a plumping problem waiting to happen . Right ? ; - )	-1
I bought this to help me dissolve the glue on some rubber maid appliqu & eacute ; s in the tub . It did not work at all .	-1
It 's okay for light adhesive like stickers and such . I do window tinting and find that Goo Gone is n't the best as the tint films leave a very thick adhesive residue.The best solution I 've found with just about anything adhesive related is 90 % alcohol sold at your local pharmacy and grocery store . It 's dirt cheap , there 's plenty and wipes very dry unlike the 70 % isopropyl . I 've used it on my LCD monitor as well and works just fine . If you feel 90 % is too strong of course by all means , test them first in a small spot .	-1
The Coverlet brand fabric bandages are the best you can buy . They FAR outperform the Band-Aid brand . The Coverlets have adhesive completely around the sterile pad making it possible to really protect a wound from germs . I wasted money on the Band-Aid brand as they are only good for protecting a wound from bumps ; they do not completely seal the wound .	-1
I 'm a big fan of Band-Aid products . I like this one for the size of the band-aids , as this size tends to get used up before other sizes.The main issue with this particular model is the strange stickiness of the bandaids . They leave goo on your skin after taking them off and they do n't breathe like the others.On the other hand , the price is right . Ca n't beat $ 3.49 including delivery .	-1
They have re-designed the sheer bandage . It is no longer flat , but has a textured surface . Believe it or not , this takes away for the adhesive properties of the bandage . Essentially this design reduces the surface of the of the adhesive . If you cut your finger and wrap it with one of these bandages , it will not stay wrapped for long . The adhesion starts pulling off because it is no longer able to make full contact like the old design did . So , you wrap your finger with one of these Band-Aids and the adhesive will give way and fall off usually within 30 minutes . I test these products .	-1
I purchased this to handle some kitty vomit on a couch cushion and to perform some general touch-ups . After repeated applications , the stain is still unaffected , and the cushions look exactly the same . Not sure where all the five-star reviews are coming from Perhaps this is effective against very recent stains that have n't had time to dry .	-1
If I could , I 'd return this thing for a full refund . It is a joke ! The one I ordered to replace this WANNABE MASSAGER is the Wahl two-speed massager that actually puts out serious , strong vibrations ! The Conair `` massager '' is very attractive looking and does have a lot of attachments but due to the fact it has such low power when in use ... .it 's a total rip off ! This is not Amazon 's fault , however , as they simply do not know any better . I would NOT waste my money on this unless you want a `` TINGLE '' vibration istead of a real one !	-1
I just bought this . Turned it on and immediately thought it was broken because it was soooo weak ! Then I came here to see what others though for maybe this thing really is just this weak ... and it is ! So the unit we just bought is not broken . It is instead the weakest personal massager I 've ever seen in my life . My wife agrees ! This goes back tomorrow . I 'm glad I bought it locally for this is one of those things where the shipping is worth more than the unit itself.You can put this thing on the tip of you nose , on high and then ask ... `` Is it on yet ? `` Absolutely worthless ! At least it looks nice ! : )	-1
This thing is messy and does not seem to improve shaving comfort and clugs both cutters and screen . Waste of money as far as I concerned .	-1
THE IDEA OF ATTACHING BLADES TO A SPRING IS SO STUPID ! YOU TAKE OFF THE COVER , BRUSH THE COVER-FINE . THEN , YOU ACCIDENTLY TAP THE BLADE AND IT FLYS OFF AND DOWN THE DRAIN ! THAT IS THE ON LY REASON I GOT IT -- -- TO GIVE THE RAZOR A SECOND CHANCE . 3 DAYS LATER -- -BYE BYE AND HELLO NORELCO !	-1
The product was short the springs that normally are included . I am disappointed that the picture on the web included 3 items and when the shipment arrived it was not as specified in the picture on the web . Not happy .	-1
The ad on this site says it is for DA 307 shaver but it doesnt work on my shaver . I compared it to the one Im replacing and the new one is totally different . Maybe there is a different model 307 that it works on but I dont think so cause why would they use the same # for a totally different shaver ?	-1
I was glad to see this item available due to the difficulty in finding replacement blades and screens for my old , but trusty , Remington electric shaver . When I first saw the blades in the package , I knew something was amiss . The part number matched the old package ( SP-62 ) , but the blade looked different . I managed to get the screen in with some difficulty , but it seems to work fine as does the spring . The problem is with the blades . They 're shorter in width than the older blades and do not hold on the `` mount '' where the blades attach to the shaver . If I 'm lucky , the blades will hold on just long enough for me to grab the cover and snap it into place . Sometimes the blades pop off , occasionally with the spring in tow , and I have to start over again . By chance if I get lucky and get the cover on , it seems to fit fine . It makes no unusual sounds when it operation , but does n't give as close a shave as the older model/style of blade . Due to the difficulty in messing with a blade device that barely stays on the shaver , I only clean it when I feel I absolutely have to . My Remington shaver has been a trusty companion for many years but since I 've had this problem ( and it looks like this may be the only replacement blade available for such an old shaver ) I wo n't be buying this item again . It may work well for more recent models , but not mine . Cynically speaking , perhaps this is the manufacturers way of forcing people to buy a new electric razor in spite of the fact that the old one they currently own is in perfect working order.Another major disappointment was the price . Last time I bought this item at a local discount chain store ( who no longer stocks them ) , the price was several dollars less . At almost $ 19.00 , I do n't consider this anything but overpriced .	-1
Perhaps this product is acceptable but does n't fit the Microscreen 2 razor that I have . I have sent it back hope it fits someone else razor	-1
I used this item to help with my back pain and instead it burned my back . Do n't buy this product .	-1
We bought this for our elderly cat , who , sad to say , has passed on . Many say that it is not recommended for animals , but our last elderly cat loved the heating pad so much ... it eased her aches and pains . A reasonable solution to the danger of direct exposure is to put it under the cat bed.In the winter , I have found that my feet hurt when they get too cold , and we live with a low thermostat . Unfortunately , when I tried it for that purpose , it simply did not get warm enough to really make a difference , even on the hot setting . For that reason , I can not recommend it .	-1
I do n't think it 's a defect , I just think it 's a really bad purchase . The heat regulator has a button that is not very solid . The cushion itself is ok but I can start the heat at & # 34 ; high & # 34 ; and the cushion does n't provide that much heat . Then I scroll it down to medium , whoops ! it gets a lot warmer ... Then the heat goes does n't stay . It 's ok because I took the habit to play with it and I presume it 's going to break one of these days ( soon ) . Now own it as I do n't like to put electric plastic items in the trash , well I 'm going to use it until it breaks . But , if I would have to buy a new one , then I would pay a few bucks to have a better one . I got what I paid for ; cheap .	-1
I usually use Liquid Tears eyedrops to keep my eyes moisturized . And I thought this liquigel would be more moisturizing and for a longer time . I guess it does last for a long time , but it is so thick that I have to close my eyes and roll them around for a few seconds just to warm it up enough to make it flowable . Its very strange . I will finish these two bottles , but I 'd never buy this gel again .	-1
i purchased this because i have 2 problems . 1. rashes ( hives ) and 2. eczema . after using it for 2-3 weeks i noticed that it was doing nothing and i was suppose to have notice less itching on the first time i have taken it . so i decided to test drive this product . i took 2 pills and i placed each pill in a cup of water , one cup with hot water and the other with cold water . it turns out that the pill is dissolved in 40-50min in hot water and more than 1hr . 30min in cold water . as a result , the ingredients of this product were not being released during this time . it was like forming in different shapes like if the pill would come apart but you would see this in one hour . after i acknowledge this , i just threw the remaining in the garbage . taking this was like taking nothing ... .. dont waste your money on this . and btw if you read the people who rated this 4-5 stars you 'll notice that they have only rated 1-10 items on amazon and have no proof of purchase under their name . which is why i bought it in the first place . sometimes we take risks because of our desperate needs but only one will suffer so beware .	-1
The items received were NOT Ontel products , they were cheap import imitations that fell apart in the shipping . They are FALSLEY advertised as Ontel products . If the product is red plastic , it is a phoney , do not purchase at any price as they are pure JUNK .	-1
The Gopher is a useful tool idea that can use some product enhancement . It is nice that it folds for easier storage . It allows you to reach for items in hard-to-reach places . Small items can be retrieved from high shelves with ease . It is rated to lift five pounds , but I do n't trust it that much . The heavier the item , the more strain on your wrist and on the Gopher.I tried using the Gopher to replace a light bulb . Seems like this would be the ideal tool to grab the bulb from a ceiling fixture and replace it . Not so . The locking mechanism does n't grip tightly enough . You can loosen the bulb , but as the bulb loosens , so does the Gopher 's grip . I was also unable to tighten the replacement bulb sufficiently . The locking grip did n't hold and it was too difficult rotating the Gopher while maintaining pressure on the pistol grip.The bottom line for me , the Gopher is a handy tool for reaching small , light , non-fragile items . It is a definite boon for people who are forced to be sedentary . It does not do the trick , however , for heavy items or items requiring a tight grip .	-1
For under $ 70 , this is not a bad price for a shaver of this design with LCD display and side pulsing technology . But this is just the shaver by itself . It does not come with the cleaning station it was originally packaged with . But even worse , it does NOT come with the charging cord ! I checked with the supplier . You get ONLY the shaver . This is being sold as a replacement unit.Besides , this is the older 7000 series model , several generations behind the latest Braun shaver model . Braun has made some really nice improvements at this point . I strongly suggest not wasting your money on this older technology . Invest a few extra $ $ and at least get the 8000 series or the newest model . You 'll be glad you did .	-1
My Braun 7680 suddenly began making a loud noise after about six months . It still shaves , but it makes so much noise that I can not use it while my wife is still asleep in the bedroom for fear of waking her up.This is a fairly expensive razor , I expected more from it .	-1
I had this shaver for only a few weeks and the charging stand/cleaner stopped working and engaging the shaver.This is a terrible design and overpriced ! ! ! Worst thing I have bought this year . I will try and get Braun to replace the stand ... .BUT WHAT A HASSLE.NO MORE BRAUN at these terribly high prices for cheap engineering .	-1
I bought this toothpaste and was shocked when I got home and read the ingredient list . The active ingredient is triclosan . Triclosan is currently being investigated by the FDA . It is also under review by the EPA who is considereing banning it . It is already banned in Europe and Canada . In short , it 's an endocrine system disruptor . It alters hormone regulation . It also contributes to making bacteria resistant to antibiotics . Not only is it bad for people , but you spit it down the sink and it gets into the water supply and harms the ecosystem . Google it . This is not stuff you want to put in your mouth.Most toothpastes do n't have triclosan , but this one does .	-1
NonyX works ! ... but this product is nothing but a combination of brown vinegar and some thickner . I found out this information on a home remedy site for foot fugus and it 's true . i made my own solution with cider vinegar ( white vinegar will not work ) aloe & a drop or two of tea tree oil.Ethanoic acid is the prime ingredient of NonyX . Look this ingredient up on a google search if you you do n't believe me . I have used NonyX in the past and always thought it smelled like vinegar it works excellent but way too expensive that 's why i 'm giving it 2 stars	-1
I tried this product and was not impressed , it was pretty greasy so I could only put it on at night with socks . I would not use it again .	-1
I bought this monitor being mislead by high rating . Despite the instrument is portable it is very inconvenient to carry it because of its triangular '' shape.But the most disappointing thing is inacurate reading . It shows 20 % higher that real pressure . In other words , when it reads 170 , which is dangerously high pressure , in reality it is just 136 , which is almost normal . To use it I need alvays have a calculator with me multiplying readings by 0.8 . I tested this monitor by comaring with one at Kiser facility . Indeed Omron is not so good as it was before.Never Omron again !	-1
I get a different reading every time I use it ... even if 3 minutes apart.I am so disappointed in this product and wish I had more carefully read the poor reviews.It is also very difficult to place the cuff on your own arm and get it right.Recommend : Do n't buy it .	-1
I have been using this cream for about a month now and I 'm sorry to say that it did not do a thing for me . I bought it based on the great reviews , but unfortunately it did not work for me , and I so needed it to work . I started having hot flashes last year and I bought the `` New Phase '' supplement which worked great for a year , but this March my hot flashes intensified and they stoped working . I bought the cream with high hopes of finding some relief , oh well ! I will try the Bio-Identical Hormones that I found online , they are more costly , but I 'm desperate . Summer is just around the corner and I need HELP ! It may work for some of you , but you wo n't know till you try , Good luck !	-1
I tried this cream for almost 3 months and it did nothing for my menopausal symptoms ! Especially insomnia ! ! ! ! ! My Gynocologist told me it is n't strong enough .	-1
This stuff is supposed to be mixed with water or juice . I tried both and both were disgusting . It makes the juice very thick and it hard to mix in and dissolve , it clumps up . It makes the juice taste nasty even though it claims to be `` tasteless '' . I personally would prefer to pop a pill than drink this slop . yuck .	-1
This is some of the messiest stuff ever ! Leaves stains on everything that pretty much never come off..which is a major let down.I was expecting more.. Not the best product out there .	-1
I bought this onsale thinking I 'd give it a try since the dual power Spray n Wash is no longer available ( ughh ! ! ) . This stuff did not work very well at all . I have to agree with the other review which stated that the product is somewhat blobby.. it does not penetrate the fabric and/or stain . It is just to thick of a mixture . It seems to work *slightly* better if the fabric is already wet . You will still experience `` runoff '' though - as in the product will just run off of the fabric instead of soaking into it . I will not buy this again and I do not recommend it at all . You would have much better luck just pre treating with your regular detergent , or letting the article soak in a water/detergent mixture for awhile before washing in the machine . I feel this SPray n Wash is a waste of money.On a sidenote , I REALLY wish they would bring back the dual action - the bottle that had dual chambers of clear and pink liquid - now that one really DID work on any stain you could think of , marvelously !	-1
i have terrible sinuses and am plagued by sinus pressure all year . everytime i asked for some sort of medicine for relief i was told to try claritan . i tried the 12 hr the 24 hr the claritan d and absolutely nothing worked and yet still everyone recommended claritan , including my doctor . I 'm pretty sure that claritan 's parent company gives out such incentives for doctors and pharmacists that all they want to recommend is claritan . it took at least 3 doctors visits and A LOT of pain before i could get a different brand of sinus medicine and any relief . I do n't recommend this to anyone , it 's a terrible joke of a medication .	-1
I 've tried all of the generics and Allegra seems to be all that works for me . The other two I tried here at Amazon just did nothing ! TaosGuy	-1

-Does n't get the dishes clean . ( And , I always rinse them before loading the dishwasher . ) -Leaves a residue on the glasses.-Creates way too much suds , which do not drain well , and can damage the motor.OTOH ... hmmm . there is no other hand . Terrible product . Plain hot water would probably work better .	-1
I always look for enviornmentally safe products . I loved this product in the begining the first two bottles I bought were great . To save money I decided to buy a case buy the 3rd bottle I started noticing a little film on my dishes and they werent as clean as i like I thought maybe I needed more rinse agent since it wasnt happening all of the time . By the 4th bottle i concluded it is definitely the detergent it is happening more and more . I had to add another detergent to this product to finish off the case . I wont be buying this again .	-1
I usually use the Seventh Generation stuff ( which works well for me ) but took a chance on this gel because it was a little cheaper . It is AWFUL ! It leaves all of my dishes covered in specks of food . It 's almost as if somehow this soap grinds up any food that 's left on the dishes into a powder and fine mists it onto everything . I do use a separate rinse aid but that did n't help . I 'm surprised with all the negative reviews this product has that it 's still selling .	-1
I now know why this product was on 'clearance ' . Guess what -- it does n't work . It might be better as a bodywash or air freshner . Because it definently does not clean dishes.My first clue should have been that the bottle warns there is some prep-work involved to using the product . Wanting things to come out 'right ' I followed this to the letter.Well , the company might as well not have included it at all . It wastes time . And it does not help the product perform any more efficiently . Nothing was clean when the cycle ended . It looked like I never even ran the dishwasher.I 've not had problems with other organic/natural products . Ecos really does itself a BIG financial disservice through such low-quality .	-1
Unfortunately , this product just does n't work . We pre-rinse plates , we 've tried adding more or less detergent , and nothing seems to help . Our dishes are always streaked with a cloudy white film , and our glasses are all cloudy . Our utensils are rarely clean , and are always spotted . I 've thoroughly checked our dishwasher to make sure there are no clogs and to ensure diry water was n't re-circulating.I do n't like the scent of lavender in dish cleaning liquid anyway , I prefer lemon or citrus , but I purchased this hoping it would be an environmentally helpful product.Sadly , it just does n't do the job . I am now stuck with 5 bottles that I am not quite sure how to use - maybe they 'll help cleaning the tub .	-1
Beware ! ! -- - Cuts great for 2-3 months maximum until cheap frail head begins to wear thin and blades start to cut more of your face than they do your beard ! ! !	-1
Worked 4 times then head broke due to flimsy construction . Braun site had no replacement head . Typical modern day made-to-break junk then they want you to purchase another . This cost me $ 6 per shave . Braun buyer beware .	-1
I took this `` gentle '' poison and got terribly sick . I took two pills with water and at 4:00 am I suddenly woke to a pain that made having a baby natural seemed the better option .

The ad clearly says bottle . I purchased two because I have trouble opening the blister pack version , and I wanted bottles . They are blister packs . So much for solving that problem !	-1
I picked the size/quantity that showed an actual bottle and paid extra thinking I 'd get a bottle rather than blister packs ( because that was what was shown ! ) and save a trip to the pharmacy . If I had known I 'd be popping blister packs and rubbing my thumbs raw ... CVS carries these in generic in a bottle for about the same price . I know where I 'll be getting mine in the future .	-1
About four months ago I was experiencing a mild yeast infection , and , in a stroke of laziness that I will never forget and forever rue , I decided to try the Monistat 1-Day Ovule instead of the 3- or 7-day kits . I inserted the ovule before bed , and the next day I woke up with the worst sensation of burning and itching that I 've EVER experienced . Just sitting at my desk at work felt like torture , and going to the bathroom was absolutely excruciating because the entire area was so swollen with the irritation . It took about four days for the swelling to subside completely , and that whole time I was still beyond sore and itchy ; it took a prescription of diflucan to knock out all of the symptoms completely . At first I thought maybe I was among the minority in this reaction , but a quick Google search and perusal of online reviews revealed that this problem seems to be fairly common with this product . If you care at all about the comfort of your ladyparts , then I 'd strongly encourage you to not waste the $ 20- $ 25 -- stick with the milder , more extended treatments , or just go see your doctor for a prescription !	-1
I bought this one time ovule , because I thought it would work and be over with , but I was sadly mistaken . It burns like crazy and the itching is worse than before I inserted the darn thing . The directions say you can use it either night or day , but sitting around with this goop coming out of you is no fun . I have always used it at night , but I thought I could get an early start on some relief . This is crazy ! I feel like I 've sprinkled hot sauce down in my underwear . It is unbearable ! Stick to the five or seven day or even a three day would be better . I wonder if it 'll work after all this . I 'll let you know if I can .	-1
I do n't care for this flavor . It does n't taste much like cheesecake , or raspberry ... just has a funny flavor . CytoSport usually nails the flavors , but they missed it on this one .	-1
I 'm not sure how the marketing department for Muscle Milk comes across with Lean Protein for this stuff , but it 's loaded with fat and sugar ... things you probably do n't want to be ingesting if you 're serious about working out.Stick to NATURE 'S BEST , ISOPURE CHOC ( LOW CARB ) 3LB , it 's a little more expensive , but you get more for your money and it 's a hell of a lot better for you , and for Caesin theOptimum Nutrition 100 % Casein Protein , Chocolate Supreme 2 Poundis the way to go .	-1
When I look for a whey powder , I look for something that is chock full of protein per serving . I bought Muscle Milk because it has a good price at Sam 's Club ( ~25 bucks for 3 pounds ) and decided to try it . I can say for a fact that this whey tastes great and mixes well . However , I do n't like the fact that I 'm getting a little less than 2/3 the protein per unit of powder as I would have gotten with another great powder , OptiNutrition Whey . I understand that Muscle Milk has a mixed formula with added `` non-fattening '' lipids and supplemental carbs . The fact of the matter is that adding your own carbs , like dextrose , to a PWO shake is relatively cheaper than buying it mixed in with Muscle Milk . Doing your own research and buying supplements separately instead of having them added as a proprietary blend is cheaper and perhaps even safer because you know more about what is going into your shake without this brand blend nonsense.Personally , I look to add at least 30 grams to my protein shakes , Post-Workout and before bed so I would take about 4 servings a day of Muscle Milk , which to me it 's strange to have only 16 grams of protein per serving in a Whey Supplement . According to ConsumerReports , 3 servings a day ( I know MuscleMilk recommends only 2 or less ) will already put me over the Heavy Metal limits as detected in this whey powder , specifically chocolate for me . The level of saturated fat in this powder is also fairly high with about 30 % of your DV in 2 servings . Basically , this protein does n't work for someone with my Whey needs . I 'll be sticking to OptiNutrition for my future purchases .	-1
Tastes good ... and that 's where it ends.150 calories a scoop with only 16grams of protein ... not great.The real kicker is the ingredient profile . It is almost all artificial , chemical ingredients , some of which , after a little bit of research , are rather toxic to the body and should not be ingested . I threw this canister out immediately .	-1
Look at the nutrion facts label provided on this cite . 19 g carbs , 12 g fat , 310 cals . Not good for anybody taking protein supplements for weight training and physique . Sure , it advertises 32g protein , but in two gigantic scoops of powder ! You do n't save money on this stuff either . 5 lbs of Muscle Milk is .10 cents cheaper per oz than Optimum Nutrtion , but think about how much powder it takes to make a serving . Trust me it 's quite a lot.It tastes like choco-chalk . I would n't say Muscle Milk powder is intolerable from a taste standpoint . Some people I know actually really like the taste , but in my opinion it has a really grainy/chalky texture . It mixes clumpy as all get out . In fact this product is clumpy already , inside the container.Bought some of this stuff in a pinch from Walmart . I was waiting on my usual protein to come in the mail . Only positive I can give is that this product is a blend and has casein in it . Casein digests slowly , compared to purely whey protein , and is good to use at night when you are n't going to get any protein intake for multiple hours . However , you have to ask yourself do you want all those carbs , fat , and calories right before bedtime ? ? ? Do yourself a favor and skip this Muscle Milk powder . Buy the good stuff like Optimum Nutrition , etc .	-1
I 'm still in search of the Stacker of the olden days which had ephedra . This is n't it . The directions said to take 1 pill . I took 4 , plus drank a cup of coffee , and also drank a can of diet Red Bull . I 'm still hungry and I might even take a nap.I read online that non drowsy allergy meds you can buy over the counter with pseudophedrine might work , so I 'll just try that next . These diet pills are useless . Also , if you try the allergy pills , I read you should n't go higher than 60 mg. Keep in mind most pills are something like 10 mg at a time.There 's just nothing out there . Rx meds are n't any good , even made me feel like my heart would explode ( Phentermine ) .On behalf of everyone that misses ephedra , I dedicate this to the FDA : .I..	-1
The Philips sonicare advance series is a piece of junk . On my first purchaseI noticed that the replacement heads never lasted the six months they aresupposed to last , cracked in less than 3 months.When the handle cracked ( after about 18 months ) I bought another.The new one , the handle cracked within 3 months , and lasted less than a year.the heads cracked and did not last even remotely close to the6 months they are supposed to . I 've tried this brush twice , I 'm throughwasting my money , I 'm going to Oral B ( Braun )	-1
i had sonicaire complete . Mold builds up horribly inside . Take it apart weekly and dry it . Still gets mold . Clean with bleach , carefully clean it so as not to get water inside , still gets mold ( wifes too ) . Finally after about 8 months or so mine stopped working . it just lets out a weak little buzz . This was my second Sonicaire device . Last ones dies too . Do n't think their made in Germany anymore .	-1
Got two years tops out of the battery which can NOT be replaced . Bad for the environment and it costs a fortune . My Ultrasonex and Braun do as good a job if not better . I like that the Braun swirls around and seems to do better getting under the gums and between teeth . As a matter of fact I read a report comparing these three brands and the Braun won out by a good amount .	-1
I was surprise to discovered all Sonicare toothbrushes are disposable item . Its battery can not be replace what so ever . Like any other electronic products , its battery and IC board are toxic and can only be dispose by your local electronic waste program . Mine lasted about 6 months , at this rate ... we 're going to end up tones of these in our landfill . It is irresponsible to produce products like this . If I had known about this I would never have bought it.Forget about this hi-tech marketing stuff . Use a regular toothbrush and get your teeth clean regularly is the best prevention .	-1
I 've been using a Sonicare brush ( handle ) since November , 2007 . I 'm on my fifth brush head . See , these brush heads used to be good for six months ( 5 brushes = > 2.5 years ) , and now these new versions supposedly are only good for three . And they are the same price ... It seems there are three possibilities for lowering the replacement time to three months . ( 1 ) Sonicare relabeled to make more money by increasing turnover . ( 2 ) Sonicare found that their products did n't live up to what they originally claimed ( in my experience they lasted six months ) . ( 3 ) Sonicare redesigned these brushes to wear out faster to make more money.I 'm on my first brush head of these `` three month '' heads , about four months in . Yes , I ignored their three month suggestion . The brush head seems to be lasting about as well as the others but I 'll report back again in two months if that is n't the case . So my guess is that Sonicare 's decision was based on ( 1 ) . If it was ( 2 ) , I suspect they would have modified their six month label to suggest 3-6 months , not just having the time to three months.On the brushes themselves , they work well . The heads never fit the handle as seamlessly ( or quietly ) as they probable could but this is n't a major problem . The new versions have a blue strip of color in the brush that does partially wear off in about four months ... Sonicare trying to tell me to replace the head , no doubt.Overall , 4 stars for the brush head , minus 2 stars for what I interpret as Sonicare trying to scam its customers by an extra $ 20-25/year . When I do look for a new brush handle , I definitely wo n't be looking at just Sonicare and will have a bias to buy another brand .	-1
This model has to be the worse electric brush I 've ever owned . It is the only one that developed black mold . After buying new brushes , Phillips ' sanitizer , and sanitizing the base , I had to toss another brush after six weeks . The only way to keep this brush clean is to break it down , clean it , then air dry it every time it is used.The plastic used appears to be a perfect breeding ground for bacteria and mold . I wonder how many people have been made ill or had allergic reactions to mold.Do n't waste your money .	-1
The seller , countrysaver , sent a counterfeit product . The & # 34 ; e-series & # 34 ; logo on the brush was blurred and of a different style from my original Sonicare brush head . This also did not work one bit on my Sonicare ( and yes , I ordered the correct brush head ) . Shame on amazon for not regulating counterfeiters .	-1
I bought this because of all the terrific reviews . I , too , have `` permanent '' bloodshot eyes , probably from sitting at a computer all night for most of my life ! ( I 'm a writer and I work well into the night . ) I 've tried many over-the-counter drops , but nothing has helped . I 've used these liberally for the past month and unfortunately , noticed no difference . It 's soothing for a short time , but my eyes are still as bloodshot as ever and the feeling of dryness returns quickly . Bummer ... the search continues !	-1
This is really a bad deal . The 7526 was first made 8 years ago and has since been followed up with 2 more Braun model series ( the 8000 and 5 series ) . Price wise , this model is not much less than the subsequent models.In fact , this reconditioned model does NOT come with the cleaning/charging base . On Amazon you can get this model WITH the charging base for about $ 1.11 moreBraun 7526 Syncro Shaver System with Clean & Charge Storage Stand . I think it 's quite clear that it would be foolish to buy this reconditioned model .	-1
With so many products being made in China , we must demand that the country of origin be made available .	-1
I think those were Chinese knock-offs even though the package looked original ! All the heads broke off after only 3 to 5 uses ! What a disappointment !	-1
They just do n't make these brush heads like they used to ! The bristle piece slowly loosens from the shaft over time , and becomes extremely loose long long before the bristles wear out . This has happened on 2 out of 2 of the brush heads I 've used so far , and I wo n't be surprised if they other 2 do the same . ( UPDATE : all of them are busted now ... ) I bought these to replace one that I had for a very long time ( years ) but was actually still in good shape , not loose at all ( and the bristles on these things really last ! ) . Anyway , these are name-brand , so I do n't know what I 'll do for an alternative ... but I 'm definitely disappointed .	-1
The first one of these I used fell apart a few weeks after I began using it . This does not inspire confidence .	-1
I bought my Emjoi epilator two years ago , and I hardly use it . I was really thrilled about getting one at the time , but I did n't find it practical enough for me to use it on a regular basis . Other reviewers have commented on it 's poor ergonomics , and they are right . I can never grip it comfortably . I do not have problems with the tweezing being too painful , but I do have to go over the same area multiple times for it to pluck all of the hairs . Sometimes I just find it easier to use my handy no frills tweezer . This is n't a product that I 'd recommend to anyone .	-1
I bought this to replace another tube winder I had bought years ago and which acted also as a stand . Since I could not find one like it again , I opted to get this product.This tube winder worked once it was on the tube . But to actually get it on the tube was a major headache . I tried to put this on a regular Colgate toothpaste tube and it took almost brute force to get the tube into the slot because the slot was so narrow . My old squeezer separated the actual winding `` stick '' from the stand , so it was a matter of just sliding it onto the tube , with the slot on the winder expanding as needed . With this one , however , because the actual winder is inside the hard frame and does not come out , the slot does not expand . One has to align the slot on the winder with the slot on the hard frame and it is what it is width-wise because the frame 's slot does not expand.I gave up after several minutes and almost breaking a nail , and had my husband try it . It even took him a long time and a lot of effort and trying repeatedly to thread the tube into the slot . I am already dreading having to use this on the next tube - I might just not . Based on this experience , I can not recommend this product , especially not if you have strength or pain issues in your hands or fingers.NOTE : After reading through other reviews of this product here it seems that this might be a quality control issue because several reviewers state that their winder fit too loosely . Ours was definitely too narrow , and if one does n't know what winder one will get ( too narrow or too wide ) , it is probably best to stay away from this altogether because it just is n't expensive enough to warrant sending it back ...	-1
These are nice , warm socks , but I do n't feel any support whatsoever . I 'll put my money into true compression socks instead .	-1
Bought these for my husband who has taken more than half the bottle . He says that it does not quite work for him . I told him that the reviews say that these are good . Well , maybe he has got to give it some more time to work .	-1
I have lived with chronic prostatitis regularly for the last six years . It 's pretty strange for someone my age , especially since I started having the issues at the age of 22 . My father has had the same issues and my younger brother began having prostate problems around the age of 18 , so It must be heriditary to my gene pool . Anyways , I have tried TONS of products to relieve my worst symptoms . From every known vitamin and herb to every known perscription from a physician . I decided to give this a try and was eager to see if it had any effect on my symptoms ( my main symptoms are extreme discomfort and having to go at night ALL THE TIME ! ) . I am not impressed.I did n't notice ANY change in symptoms or discomforts related to prostate issues . I am not sure if it 's the quality of the ingredients or something else , but this had no effect on my problems . I do not recommend it at all . I do have some recommendations for people though who might be searching for relief . Solaray has something out called ( easy enough ) Prostate Caps . They are made from bovine prostate extract and they have given me some relief . I also have to say that after two months of perscription Avodart , I am definitely showing great improvement . I highly recommend trying out Avodart if you can . Also , a multivitamin containing zinc and quercetin is a help too ! Give those a try . Skip this ! !	-1
I bought this brand because it contained the 'full spectrum ' of all the ingredients in turmeric . The pills are somewhat large but not so big I couldnt swallow them . Ive seen other , smaller capsules but they may have been a smaller dosage . It says to take 1 softgel daily , which is a little more convenient then some others that require 3+ capsules daily.These pills gave me diarrhea for over a day.. ive tried it twice several days apart and each time I got really bad diarrhea , so im pretty sure it was the turmeric . Its a little ironic - turmeric supposedly helps stomach upsets ! I have crohns disease and wanted to take these for the supposed anti inflammatory / stomach soothing effects.If you want to take turmeric , this might be a good choice , but be wary of stomach upsets and take it in the middle of a large meal , like the directions say . Also , this is a little more expensive then other brands.Im not sure if turmeric really works , but if you can tolerate these , then New Chapter is a good brand . I dont doubt the quality of this product , it just didnt work out for me . Also keep in mind that while turmeric is a popular herb , there have not been any conclusive scientific studies showing any benefit of turmeric .	-1
I had high hopes for this product . Even though I have a steamer which I think is the next best thing since sliced bread , I thought I would get my floors really , really clean each week by adding this step , I was so very wrong . This is a total disappointment to me and I would rate it a 0 if I could . My daily routine after buying the swiffer , was vacuuming the floor , using the wetjet , then my steamer . Yesterday , about a month in , it dawned on me and unfortunately , too late to return it as I no longer have the receipt , that the wetjet is totally useless , why it took me a month , I have no idea as it 's worked the same since day one . It does NOT leave my floors clean , it leaves a sticky residue ( and no , I am not overusing the spray ) and it costs a lot of money to maintain . I see barely any dirt on the pad after cleaning both my kitchen and bathroom , then when I use my steamer afterwards , that pad is picking up a lot of grime even though I clean my floors once a week using all 3 . I am giving the swiffer away to a friend who thinks I 'm crazy and they can find out for themselves and I will stick to the vacuum and the steamer which I trust to actually leave my floors clean .	-1
Just purchased the one that requires batteries . This is the worst purchase ever -- bottle of liquid lasted one cleaning . New pad would not stick . Regular Swiffer wet and dry pads work better than this and you can purchase the store brand . I 'm going to return this piece of junk . If I could , I 'd give it zero stars .	-1
The first one is way better than this one , one jet is plugged and the handle falls apart . I am looking to buy the first one as I did not keep mine .	-1
This works well when it works . It 's perfect for quick cleanups and gets the majority of the crud off the floor . They 're so convenient I do n't want to go back to a mop and bucket , but they are very fragile . We 've had two break within 6 months just by tipping over . I set the handle up against the wall and it fell over . When I picked it up the spray button did n't work anymore . This happened twice . I would hope they 'd be a little more sturdy than that . It 's probably just a loose circuit but they 're not easy to open up to fix . I guess you ca n't expect much at this price .	-1
I used this on my tile floor -- granted , it does n't say it 's for tile floors , but I thought I would give it a try . The blackness of the pad was impressive ... . at first , but then I decided to do another test . Taking a clean pad IN HAND , I squirted some of the solution onto ONE tile -- a tile I had already cleaned by the way . Oddly ... there was some `` dirt '' there , but on closer inspection of that tile , I also saw a couple of little tiny black dots embedded in the nooks and crannies of the tile . Hmmmm . So.. using now , a clean rag , I sprayed the tile with `` LA 's Awesome '' , and made it squeaky clean . Took yet ANOTHER pad , sprayed the tile with the wet jet solution ... and it was blackening once again.I had noticed in the weeks that I had been using the wet jet that the grout in my tile was getting darker and darker . I finally got down on my hands and knees and did a really close-up inspection of my tile . Black streaks here and there . So ... the wet jet was n't picking up the dirt -- it was smearing it around and leaving it in the grout , and the nooks and crannies.So , I cleaned my floor and scrubbed the grout with LA 's Awesome and then did the wet white-papertowel test : A little water , go over the tile ... it remained white.I now have 'redesigned ' my wet jet : I take a microfiber washrag , fold it in half , and stick it to the bottom of my wetjet . I then spray the floor ( not with the swiffer solution ) and wipe it with the rag . Peel off the rag and rinse it in the sink . And if you ca n't stand dirt on your hands , wear gloves ! I do n't know what 's in that swiffer solution but in my opinion it has something in it that reacts with the pad and makes it turn black , and makes you `` think '' it 's doing something.I take pride in having a clean house , as many shoppers do , and have no qualms about scrubbing my floor the old fashioned way -- on my knees ! Swiffer has great marketing ... but that 's about it .	-1
I bought this a few years ago and thought it was absolute garbage . The cleaning pads they sell to go with it hardly pick anything up , they dry out within 30 seconds of mopping , not even enough time for me to sweep my small , small kitchen . The bottle of solution also leaked all over the place . Tried to fix it , but realized it was just garbage so It went back to the store . I have had bad luck with Swiffer products , have bought 3 or 4 of them now and I do n't understand what the hype is all about . It 's JUNK !	-1
I bought my Swiffer Wet Jet Starter Kit from Target in March 2013 for about $ 19 . I am writing this after my first use . Pad would not stay on so I used 2 rubber bands to keep it in place . Only one of the two jets allowed cleaner to come out , it flowed out but did not spray . If you did n't completely vaccum or sweep the floor ahead of time , the mop will only push dust around . Cleaner fluid did not clean my vinyl floor . I knew the poor reviews before making my purchase , but I was very hopeful because I wanted a disposible pad for cleaning my bathroom floors . Returning it today to Target .	-1
I used the Swiffer WetJet mop for a little while , but ultimately ended up replacing it with a steam mop instead . I did n't like Swiffer WetJet for the following reasons : - Cleaner left a residue on my floor , sometimes sticky- Did n't like the smell of the cleaner ( too strong ) - The consumables ( pads and solution ) are expensive to refill- Do n't understand why it has to use a battery-operated dispensing device . Other mops simply use pressure from gravity.When I switched to the steam mop , I was amazed at how much nicer my floors were . No more sticky residue after cleaning , and no overwhelming scent . The steam mop has a higher initial investment , but there 's really no consumable costs since you use water and the pads can be thrown in the wash . I did the math and if you use the Swiffer WetJet for about 1-1.5 years , you 've paid for the steam mop .	-1
The first time I used it I was surprised at how little cleaning it did . A month later , when I tried it again , even though the batteries were OK , the fluid did not come out when I tried the spray . A real waste of money and time .	-1
Rated this the same as the cleaner and the cleaning pads . My wife does n't like them , so I would n't recommend them to anyone .	-1
I have bone spurs and feet pain from arthritis ( hands also ) . My wife massages the cream in and it feels great for a couple of hours only . the cream has a nice texture and goes on nice . It feels warm after a while . It is a salicilate ( aspirin ) cream with the same formula as aspercreme . aspercreme comes in lotion ( liquidy ) and creme and is much cheaper than mobisyl . seems to help better with muscle aches and back pain . massaging seems to work the best of all . Enjoy !	-1
I loved the idea of a wrist blood pressure monitor , so I was happy to get this one . At first , I thought my blood pressure was lower - then I tested a couple family members and then tested it against other monitors . It was always low , so I returned it for another one . Same thing , so the manager at Rite Aid let me try one more - it was also 20 - 25 points low every time.I am pretty disappointed as it was quick , comfortable and easy to use . If accuracy is important , you might want to test this against some other blood pressure monitors , though . Maybe I got 3 faulty units in a row , but that does n't seem very likely .	-1

These `` baby on board '' signs are small and inexpensive , but because they are opaque , they create a visibility problem by obstructing part of the view , no matter which window you place them on . The suction cup is also prone to detaching no matter what you do ( including cleaning the window with alcohol wipes and moistening the cup itself with good old saliva ) . I should have bought something that 's see-through so I can see everything unobstructed , especially when I 'm changing lanes while driving at 75 mph .	-1
I bought this based on all the glowing recommendations but I just could not digest it . After a week or so of using it daily ( only 1 shake a day ) it gave me horrible gas and constipation that went away after I stopped using it . I often make shakes from other protein powders and never had a problem . Not for me.PS- it does have a greenish tinge to it and as for taste , it is ok ( not great ) in milk , but totally gross in just water .	-1
I got some of the vanilla flavor in an individual sized packet . I had high hopes because we liked their other flavors pretty good.First off , why is it GREEN ? Second , it tastes like silly putty . I kid you not . This had to be the most vile protein shake I 've ever tasted in my life . I managed two sips , and dumped the rest down the sink . It is completely revolting . No , I did n't add anything else to it - if I wanted to make my own shakes , I would n't be buying shake mix.I gave it two stars instead of one because it does have a good consistency and is high in vitamins , but that 's it . The other flavors are fine , but the vanilla was a horrible surprise . YUCK .	-1
Bubble gum not Nepol . ice cream but , way better than the peanut butter . It did n't have the after taste that the other goes but , I would n't buy or eat either again .	-1
This battery was given a specific test , and it failed . We are putting in motion activated sprinklers in the yard to chase away the deer . The sprinkler takes one 9 volt battery . The battery was in less than two weeks and quit . This is totally unsatisfactory in that the sprinklers have to be operational 24/7 in order to keep my landscape from total destruction by the deer . The manufacturer of the motion sprinkler indicates that a battery should run in a unit for approximately six months . Needless to say , we are using other batteries .	-1
Overpriced , does n't work , spray some vinegar on the problem let sit over night and save your money ! The vinegar works on lime and calcium , not sure about rust .	-1
This product does not do what anything that the commercials say that it will do . I tried it more than three years ago and it made no difference at all on the hard water deposits on my shower doors , either calcium or lime.I followed the instructions to the letter , and used up an entire bottle on two shower doors , but it had no effect . I thought maybe I had just gotten a bad batch , so I bought another bottle at Walmart four months ago to give it a try again .Even after scrubbing and scrubbing , nothing happened . I do n't know if it works for anyone else but after two tries with two different bottles of it around 2 1/2 years apart , and with over two hours of my time and effort , plus the cost of the product wasted , I can only advise that you save your money for another product that might work . I just wish that I knew what that product was .	-1
I purchased this scale to keep track of the weight of my cat , who is a little overweight . Our vet recommended a baby scale . I ordered this Salter Model because it got quite a few good reviews.However , if I could give this scale a rating of zero , I would . It just plain does n't work . When my cat was at the vet last week , she weighed 12.2 pounds . I tried to weigh her several times on this scale , and she consistently weighed 5.6 pounds . And , she just curled up in the top cradle , so she was fully cooperating . It 's just ridiculous that something this simple should n't work properly . I kept checking to make sure I had it on the `` LB '' setting , as I just kept thinking I was doing something wrong.I did contact Amazon customer service , and they issued a pre-paid mailing label so that I would n't have to pay for return shipping . Thank you Amazon for such great customer service .	-1
While I regard this method essential to my dental health because of consequential gingivities without it , the MATERIAL BUILD QUALITY IS POOR . HOSES WILL CRACK NEAR THE PULSATOR UNIT , IT IS INEVITABLE . Two crackedwithin weeks of one another and I am the only one in the house who uses it . OVERPRICED for quality delivered . Wish there were alternative manufacturers !	-1
Failed after 2 uses.I had the older version of this model and it lasted for 7 years before beginning to leak .	-1
I bought this item 8 months ago . All of a sudden , it stopped pumping water . It has a two year warranty . Now , I have the option of shipping it back to the service center or buying another one . I need a water pik , but the postage and the hassle of sending it somewhere is simply not worth it . And the time it will take to get it back . This is how they make their money- they sell you something that is shoddy and give it a two year warranty then they give you no choice but to buy another one because when the time comes to make use of the warranty , the time and expense you have to take to make use of it cancels the benefit . If they gave it a 6 month warranty , I would not had expected so much . A two year warranty led me to believe this is a mugh better product than I thought . It is a sales tactic .	-1
My old , brand X , water flosser died after about 5 years of near daily use . I bought this Waterpik to suppliment my daily routine of manual flossing + waterpik + brush after every meal . I love the way it pulses and cleans stuff out that is trapped between your teeth . My old flosser did not work very well , even when it was new - but I did n't know it until I bought this unit to replace it . It pays to stay with the name brand , Waterpik . Update - my unit failed after less than two months . Waterpik sent me a new unit , but since the first one failed so quickly , I can no longer recommend them . 2nd update : the replacement unit failed after one month of use - definitely not a quality item you can depend on . I RATE THIS AS DO NOT BUY .	-1
] I bought this to replace an older model of Waterpik Water Flosser . The older model 's tubing kept splitting because it had become brittle.This new models pump is not as strong as the old model . I bought this new model in 2012 and am writing this review in 2014.Within six months the model started choking . The pump worked but no water coming out or weak . I called Waterpik and complained . They hymned and hawed and claimed that it was build up because of water quality . I told them this is not true . I live in a city that has some of the cleanest water in the country . It comes from a granite lined reservoir in the mountains and the city water has to add so that it does n't eat at the pipes . On top of that my older Waterpik never had a problem over the years I have had it . They sent a new head tube unit this did not work.I cleaned it with running vinegar through . Sometimes this worked sometimes not . I found just filling the reservoir with water and putting the handle in the sink and letting it drip out sometimes solved the problem . Eventually the unit stopped working all together no matter what I did . I will contact Waterpik again . I do n't expect anything because I am probably beyond their warranty period.I found a repair handle tube on Amazon [ [ ASIN : B000A8EHU6 WaterPik hose repair kit with handle . ] and repaired my old Waterpik and have been using it since with no problems . You can read my review on this hose repair kit with handle and it tells you how I did it as the instructions that came with it would not work as my old hose was to brittle . My review title on the repair kit is `` Fixed my old Waterpik but had to do a different install '' This new Waterpik they are using a different pump that is supposedly quieter . Relatively it is but both it and the old pump are loud . You ca n't pump water quietly . But who cares the pump is a little quieter if it breaks down and does n't work . If you have an old water pick fix it !	-1
These cloths pick up lint so efficiently that once it is on the cloth , it will not come off until you wipe you eyeglasses , then a bazillion litter fibers cover your lens . Try cleaning it with soap and water . If you are lucky , you can clean your eyeglasses once or twice until it more fibers are transferred . Try cleaning it in the washing machine . Forget about it - you ruined it . You will never get rid of the lint now . It is still good for applying car wax , but you can never clean your eyeglasses again .	-1
When you first put in on , the viscosity seems fine . But within a minute or two it thickens considerably , almost making it like you used nothing at all . Who wants to have to stop to either add water or reapply after a minute or two ? I 'm kinda busy by then ! I will not be purchasing again .	-1
Way too sticky ! ! And dries out too quickly ! Bought this for 'backdoor ' play , NOT recommended ! Got it everywhere cause it makes little 'web ' like things when applying it !	-1
ok	-1
I do n't understand all the 5 star reviews . Maybe these people have 5 minute sessions and do n't really notice that after 20 , 30 , 40 , etc . this stuff gets so sticky that I actually had lube strings ( for lack of a better word ) coming off from my skin where it had been applied . I 'm going back to Passion lubes . Far better and the price difference is barely noticeable , but the quality sure is .	-1
I understand the benefits of water Soluble lubricants , but I ca n't see the use of a lubricant that dries up within 5 minutes . If you are looking for an intimate night with you partner this is not the Lubricant that I would suggest . The lube felt cold and wet and actually became sticky after a few minutes.We tried a few different types both silicon and water soluble . In the end we decided on the Water Soluble AstroGlide . In my opinion Silicon based is way more fun ( never ending slippery ) , but the side effects are just not worth it ( Clean Silicon based right after or you risk infections ) .Feel free to ask any questions . I monitor my reviews often .	-1
Too gummy . I do n't know if its the one I have or the whole line , but this is too gummy . I will not reorder this product .	-1
This is the worst lube ever ! It is sooo very sticky - it starts out fine but within 1 minute it is so very sticky.We had to wash it off and start with our other lube . DO NOT BUY this . It is worse then no lube because it gets soooo sticky .	-1
I love windex ... .the product does a great job and these bottles are large and excellent in value . Why two stars ? Because the nozzle drips so much ! i feel like i 'm losing half of the bottle every time i spray . Really messy .	-1
I have some old slides and they are dusty and have spots . I read in reviews that this cloth was recommended . I was very disappointed when it scratched one of my slides though it did n't scratch all of them . I would have to say to be careful and try on one that is not important . Even then I would be hesitant . Back to the drawing board as far as my slides . I will just use this cloth to clean my computer screens .	-1
This trimmer was awful . It pulled hair from my face rather then cutting it . If I wanted a hair puller I have pliers for that and do not need to buy a trimmer to pull my facial hair out of my skin . Boo .	-1
Who designed this piece of junk ? I 've owned several beard trimmers over the years , including a couple of Wahls . This is by far the worst trimmer I 've ever purchased . I opened it up and was very surprised at how cheap the attachments were . Very difficult to get on and off , and about the flimsiest plastic you could ever imagine . I finally got the main attachment on and turned on the trimmer . And as I did , the power switch broke . That 's right . The first time I turned it on , the power switch BROKE . This trimmer is a piece of junk . Period . If I could 've given it zero stars , I would have . I 'm returning it to Amazon immediately .	-1
Brand new groomer , it snags and pulls facial hair ... .I expected more from a Wahl but I guess this is why it is so cheap .	-1
I was enticed by the low price and decent reviews this trimmer received . Unless you enjoy your facial hair being snagged in the cheap jaws of this tool and a mess around your sink every time you use it , stay away from this . I used to own a Norelco trimmer with vacuum and the battery gave out after a year and half of use . Guess I should gotten one of those again , but serves me right for being a cheap skate .	-1
The transformer that charges the trimmer burnt out , and melted part of the housing in less than one month . Therefore I do not reccommend this product unless you like to throw your money away . Also , at my expense I mailed the burnt out transformer back to Wahl as they requested , and they sent a new one , which burnt out in two days . Therefore I have had TWO of the transformers for this unit burn out and melt . Since it only operates on power charged by a transformer , it is useless .	-1
Pros : Inexpensive ... Cons : poor quality attachments , small size , noisyThis mustache trimmer is disappointing . I saw it got mixed reviews here on amazon , I should have leaned toward the negative ones . Everything in the photo is much smaller than it seems in the picture , that comb is a joke . This thing is tiny but its loud as hell . The shave is fairly close but the blade platform it self is so small I end up doing more work than I did with my bigger con-air trimmer . The cheap attachments are hard to put on AND take off.Its decent for the price , but I 'm going to save my money and get a much better system and a more trusted brand . There are certain things you should n't be cheap with ; Lesson learned .	-1
The Wahl Groomsman is an inexpensive option for deftly trimming your beard , moustache , or goatee ; just do n't expect to see it last terribly long . I had a goatee for many years and usually kept it looking neat and trim with a good pair of scissors and the right comb . But let 's be honest ... that takes time and does n't always provide the best consistency . When you 're on the go you need a good trimmer that gives that consistency and speed and the Groomsman did that in spades . What it lacked was longevity . I found the batteries would quickly drain even when left on the charger . Switching them helped but the problem returned . It 's hard to know if it was a problem with the charger or what , but it was past the warranty and Wahl effectively said `` tough luck '' . Eventually it would n't hold a charge or operate even when plugged in , which told me it was a defective power cord . A replacement was as much as a new unit . Net result : back to trimming the old fashioned way . If you 're looking for a trimmer this is the cheap easy option , but do n't expect it to hang around too long . There 's probably better made higher quality trimmers out there , so if you 're serious about keeping the facial hair and want it nice neat and trim I 'd suggest looking elsewhere .	-1
It was cheap - and for a reason . The plastic guard broke the first time I used it . Motor makes a horrible noise now after using it for a month . Its heading for the trash can soon .	-1
The razor still works but the plastic attachments are plastic and break easily . I am ordering another brand but I could not recommend this . The whole reason for having a beard/mustache trimmer is having quality attachments that allow for different levels of trim . The quality of these attachments is sub par and not worth it at any cost .	-1
The metal trimmer is excellent quality . But it is no better than the attachments that allow trimming . These attachments are almost impossible to attach to the metal trimmer . I could not get the main attachment to attach in spite of my best efforts . This makes the trimmer useless . The instructions did not explain at all how to attach , only how to use the trimmer after an attachment was on . I agree wholeheartedly with the other user 's comment that this is not the Wahl we used to know .	-1
Received these Duracell units 1-25-2014 via USPS . All bear a & # 34 ; use before 2016 & # 34 ; . They have less than 2 years of mfr 's . suggested shelf life life left . This is not acceptable for use in garage door opener remotes.Inasmuch as Duracell and Energizer state a shelf life of 7- 10 years , I can only assume that these have been sitting on someone 's shelf for 5-8 years.If seller will replace these with new stock , I will reverse this review . jrb	-1
I had written a review for Ray o Vac batteries after last year , a consumer article stated that the top 3 brands were equal . This years article states Duracell Procell as the best alkaline battery on the market . I do n't believe it , we bought these Feb 6 , and remote for t.v . stopped working after about a week . They could make it a hundred year guarantee , how many people will send back 1 or 2 batteries , and then where to ? There 's is no way a battery with average usage will last anywhere near that long.This is not a terrible battery by any means but it also is not everything they claim	-1
Caveat Emptor , the batteries I received only registered 82 % charge when I installed them into a Mac trackpad . enuf said .	-1
Twice I have had these batteries leak in a electronic atomic clocks . The first time there was corrosion and a mess . The second time there was a mess and the clock would not work when I replaced the batteries . I was almost going to throw it away but I scratched the connections deep and the clock started to work again . Then there was acid on my hands and all over the table . Better pay more money rather than take a chance on something that is going to leak and make a mess . Even cheap generic batteries when they leak did not make this much of a mess . These were working clocks on my wall , not something sitting in a drawer somewhere . They do seem to have a long life though , if you do not mind having to clean up a mess when it is time to replace them .	-1
I bought these for my Roku 3 remote control ( which has a headphone jack for ear buds ) and its not like I watch a lot of streamed media ... a bit in the morning and a bit at night ... batteries lasted 2 days TOPS compared to regular Duracell coppertop batteries . The regular Duracell coppertop batteries lasted a week or more .	-1
These leaked super quick and damaged stuff like clocks , flashlights , lanters and remotes . I am surprised at all of the good reviews which I used when I selected these . Maybe I am just the unlucky one .	-1
it doesnt really get off baked on dirt very well . Seems like regular cleanser foim store . I think it wasnt worth it .	-1
I was pretty disappointed by this stuff . I have to use a ton of it over and over again to get tough cakes on spots off , unlike the last brand I had tried . It also leaves a white film , and although I realize that happens with most other cleaners , it again is hard to get off , to the point that I have to spray it or use a damp cloth to get it off . It just takes too many steps ... .going back to my old cleaner .	-1
This scraper is disposable and the sliding feature that helps to protect you from getting cut when you are using the scraper , gets in the way when you want to use the scraper . It does the job but I have other better quality scrapers that I prefer .	-1
Granted , this is a rather unscientific way of judging accuracy as I do not have another thermometer to compare , but consistently this thermometer keeps indicating I am slightly hypothermic . I 've tried taking my temperature other times when feeling ill , and it seemed to be a normal reading which surprised me . Before doing this review , ( and I am feeling perfectly fine ) , I decided to give this thermometer another shot . I took 34 readings : 96.9 , 97.1 , 97.2 , 97.1 . In the past I have always remembered being of normal temperature , but those low reading ( webMD says it should be within 1 degree of 98.6 normally ) do n't give me confidence in this product . Oddly enough , there was another review saying that 97.1 was a consistent reading he got.As for the beeping and the display ? Those are fine . I can hear it just fine , but sure , do n't bring it to any rock concerts . The display is easy to read . It is n't backlit , but just flip on the light.So , your mileage may vary . Some people report accurate readings , mine have seemed off . Maybe I got a dud ? Hope this was helpful . Let me know if there is anything I can clear up in the comments .	-1
I got this for my first aid kit . To my surprise it comes in its own self contained carry case and has covers ( 5 ) too . Unfortunately the covers do not fit in the case with the thermometer but it appears to be well made , will store previous readouts , comes with written instructions that make sense and just plain works great . I got the flex tip since it was for my mobile bag but the Led is large and it only takes 10 seconds to get a reading and yes the tip really is flexible.Update : The beeping sound is so low that it ca n't be heard most often . I have found no way of turning it up . So you have to count to 10 then get your reading the beeper is too low .	-1
what kind of incompetent merchants would sell something for three bucks and slap a ridiculous shipping charge on that	-1
It was very powerful , but very uneven . And seriously my bathroom mirror kept getting soaked . PLUS there should be two speeds . Not just one long stream which you ca n't control . Grrrrrrrrrr , wish I would get my money back .	-1

I purchased this brace because the Ace brace I previously used was uncomfortable . I thought neoprene would be smoother and not dig into the side of my foot . Unfortunately , this brace has a thick seam right under the heel . It runs large and I have the smallest size , so I wear it over my sock , but I feel the seam ridge under my foot , and it 's even more uncomfortable than the Ace brace . I feel as though I 'm wearing high heels , and I 'm off balance ! I also wish the top edge of the brace ended up higher on my leg because when I bend my ankle the top edge digs into my leg . I 'm giving it 2 stars because it does seem smooth otherwise , and it does provide me with enough support . However , I wo n't wear it . I prefer the Ace which is pretty comfortable if I wear the brace over a sock so the seams do n't irritate my skin .	-1
The underside of the sock has a thick trim , you can feel it not to mention the way its cut , it sorta strangles the backside of the foot .	-1
Hot . Tight . I guess I ca n't knock it for the latter . But I would not buy it again . Inside the box is only one , as well ( this is advertised ) .	-1
i bought this to use while playing squash after i injured my wrist . This provides the perfect support I want , but is useless since it does not stay in place . Forget about staying in place while plying squash , this slips away from my wrist while driving or doing any other routing activity .	-1
These slipped down my arm every chance they got . It did nothing to help protect my wrists even with lightweight activities . Definitely recommend that you go with something that straps around your hand and wrist .	-1
I have what I consider to be narrow wrists , but these things could strangle a snake . I put them on and ca n't wait to take them off .	-1
I bought this because I started writing heavily and my hand/wrist/arm was giving me excruciating pain . I considered this as a cheaper alternative to the wrist widget . When I tightened this to where I needed , I cut off circulation which caused more pain and the though the wrist widget is more expensive , it did exactly what I needed .	-1
This product must be a kids size large . I have a size large in another brand that fits quite well .	-1
I ordered this first in XL , the size that should fit me according to McDavid . It was too small for me to pull it up over my knee . So I ordered it in XXL , the next larger size . This one is sloppy loose , and has to be bunched up under the straps in order to stay on at all . So what is a customer to do ? Two return charges now , and no size that actually fits . This is a brand name that I will avoid .	-1
I have used this three times . It dries my car well . After each use I have stored it damp and rolled up in the tube , as per the manufacturer 's directions . Last Saturday I got it out of the tube and it has little pink spots all over it . I think it is some kind of mold . I used it anyway and it still dries well , but I do n't like handleing mold or rubbing mold on my car . I think I will go back to towels .	-1
I purchased this item to dry my car . I own a black car and do n't recommend this product . Instead use a soft microfiber waffle towel . This product leaves streaks and swirl marks on the paint finish its to rough .	-1
This may be more of an oversight on my part . I was expecting something like the Shammy but what I got was some rubbery polymer that does absorb spills but again , not as good as paper towels . Save your money unless you are into spandex !	-1
It doesnt do anything just hard to move around on the car , doesnt absorb any water . just useless . will not buy another .	-1
I GUESS SOMEONE WANTED IT MORE THAN I DID IT WAS GONE BEFORE I RECEIVED IT NOT YOUR FAULT.THANKSBILL MARTIN	-1
Given we were n't trying to conceive , I got these as a backup against being a few days late . Since I needed to try one to give an accurate review , I asked my GF to test one , and it came back positive . Given she 'd just had her cycle 2 days before , we were pretty confidant it was a false positive . While this could be a fluke , this seems to be the main mantra especially for its claim of accuracy . And I 'm not sure of the value of these tests if you 're going to have to go to the doctors for a confirmation anyway .	-1
For the last 10 years my husband I have not been preventing pregnancy , but not trying either . In that time , I 've had to take several tests as I am irregular and not taking birth control . I normally use the cheap HCG pregnancy test strips , but do n't ( did n't ) actually trust them . I decided to try the Clearblue ones , as it 's pretty hard to misinterpret the reading of & # 34 ; Pregnant & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; Not Pregnant & # 34 ; and sometimes I just need to keep it simple . Plus , now we are actively trying to conceive and excited about the possibility of being pregnant.I used the HCG test 30 days after my cycle and it read negative . But I felt a little nauseous , we just started trying , I figured it was a good possibility . The Clearblue test read & # 34 ; PREGNANT & # 34 ; - yay ! But that other test strip was still nagging at me . So I tried another one - no dice , only one line - not pregnant . So I just decided to call my doctor and go in to find out once and for all . NOPE . Not Pregnant . Now , I am out my stupid co-pay too . I will stick to my cheap HCG strips and now I trust them . Whereas these Clearblue ? Notsomuch .	-1
I thought it would be a nice change to see WORDS instead of a pink or blue line as positive proof . Instead this `` digital '' stick gave us an error . If we 'd used the standard strips with the two lines we 'd have an answer.AVOID computerized tests like this . Save your $ $ .	-1
I 've used many different types of pregnancy tests ranging from store brands to expensive name brands and I have to say , this one ( which I would consider a more expensive name brand ) is not worth paying extra for . It 's major feature is that it clearly reads `` pregnant '' or `` not pregnant '' on the indicator , but other than that , you pee on it and the collection part of the stick is not any larger or easier to use and it gives you results in the same amount of time as any other test I 've used . It was accurate for me , so that is not an issue . Overall , if you ca n't figure out how to read a traditional pregnancy test , which simply has a `` + '' or `` - '' , then this is the test for you , but if that is the case , perhaps you should seriously reconsider having kids .	-1
After having 7 kids , I think I 've used just about every pregnancy test out there and for the most part , they are tests , nothing fancy . If you get two lines , you get a positive and you KNOW you are pregnant ( no matter how faint ) , and if you get nothing , you may or may not be pregnant . Right ? So when I was offered this digital one for review , I thought it was perfect timing , since I was wondering if I was pregnant with my eighth child ... and I have lots of experience with tests ... perfect ! The first test worked out okay , was negative but it worked easily enough . The second test I took a few weeks later was REAL disappointing . I followed the directions to a tee , and then it registered that it was working and then just blanked out . Yup , welcome to the world of digital technology . For the overpriced tests ... you expect them to WORK ! ! ! It 's ridiculous to have to call in to get a replacement ... when you may or may not need another one later ! To make matters worse , it seems they are inaccurate in their POSITIVES . At least the other tests were a done deal if you came back positive ... but these are a question even for that ! I really ca n't recommend these tests ... they are overpriced , do n't work accurately , and on top of all that you have errors . What an emotional roller coaster ... just toss the things and say forget it !	-1
I think my leg may have been on the smaller side of what this contraption is made for because it just would not stay in place while I was running ! I loved the straps small size and , for the first few minutes it would be of obvious help but it slid down my leg and required constant adjusting . I ended up returning it .	-1
I purchased this item for running with my patellofemoral syndrome ( kneecaps do n't track correctly ) . I am an average to thin weight 5 foot 2 female in my 30s . I did n't find it to make any difference . I ended up seeing a doctor and a physical therapist and was taught to use Kiniseotape and do some strengthening exercises instead . Maybe this works for some but I did n't find it to make any difference . On the plus , it 's not too expensive so might be worth a try before you spend more to see a doctor .	-1
I wanted to like this Knee Strap because of the great reviews . It did not work for me . The strap put too much pressure around my knee cap and the inside of my knee ached . The strap seemed too restrictive for my purposes .	-1
It does n't stay where it is supposed to stay . I found this to be more bothersome than my knee issues .	-1
Very disappointing.The upper strap did not stay in place and slipped down even after just walking a few steps . I measured myself and did have the proper size . I tightened it as much as possible but nothing worked.BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE ... ... ... I was refunded only half what I paid and when the strap arrived it came with a very rude soundingreturn policy . I then read the feedback ratings at the Cho-Pat storefront on Amazon and wow they have one rude lady leaving very rude responses to the complaints made here on Amazon.I was going to order another product from them but they lost me as a customer forever .	-1
The cream does it 's job well , it 's moistureisez my dry skin , but do not expect any wrinkle disappearance miracle . As long as you are not planning to go outside or into the warm room it 's good . It laves some film in the face and even if you do not perspire at all your face will be a little sweaty . It is not too bad as other creams though . Smell is ok , not roses but it is not stinky.Recently I noticed that i have headache all night long if I use this cream in the evening . I tried not to use it - no headache . Applied it again - all night long I was having a headache . I did some research and ONE of the side effects of pycnogenol is a headache . There are few other side effects the DermaE never mentioned on the product package . More information on the pycnogenol is here : [ ... ] ALSO , pycnogenol is not recommended for pregnant and breastfeeding girls , and the warning is not on the DermaE package ...	-1
seems like it was used . not completely full and no plastic shield covering the cream like derma e usually provides .	-1
In my opinion , this is the worst toothbrush I have ever purchased . The brush head is too narrow to clean efficiently and the handle is so slim that it 's difficult to grip . The handle kept slipping around in my hand . The area of the handle that was designed for gripping is too close to the brush head and holding the toothbrush at that point is both uncomfortable and unnatural . I 'm impressed with other Oral-B toothbrushes , but this one is terrible .	-1
This is the worst toothbrush I have ever used . The size and amount of bristles are about one quarter that of a `` normal '' adult sized toothbrush . I feel like I am brushing with a childs toothbrush . These really suck ! What a waste of money ! Update : 5/23/2011 . At least one bristle comes off the brush into my mouth every time I brush with this toothbrush . I 've never had this happen with any other toothbrush I have ever used . This product is garbage .	-1
Am I the only one that gets tired of cordless electric razors dying on cue ? At one year - poof ! I called Remington and they said the battery is only supposed to last a year . I have had every generation of this Remington . I 'm trying another brand this time - maybe the Panasonic Close Curves . If I do , I 'll edit this review as to the outcome.EDIT Oct 2008 : OK , I found a fantastic shaver . I bought the Panasonic ES2067W Wet/Dry Epiglide Ultra Epilator for $ 99 . It has a regular head with a screen for shaving close , and two epilator heads . One of the epilator heads is narrow and small for taking off hair anywhere delicate , and one that has three rotating heads to quickly and easily epilate larger areas like the legs . Oh yes , and the screen head has a pop up edge and a plastic comb cover that goes over the screen/pop up edge to take longer hairs to a short enough length to epilate or just to leave short - great for bikini area.I was surprised to find it a lot less painful that my first epilator the Epilady . I love the many heads and versatility of the multiple heads.The design is elegant and easy to hold . FORGET Remington - they can keep it and their bad rechargeable batteries : )	-1
These perform worse than the two year old screen and blades I was using before . These do n't shave as close and so it takes longer to get the job done .	-1
What a mess . Nothing fit . I could n't get it to work.Was it me or the device ? I used a C02 pressure thing to unclog it instead.C02 worked instantly .	-1
There was only one review available on this product when I ordered it . The person that uses the product reported that compared to the more mainstream products this one was not as good . The place were I purchased it is very good and the merchant did everything in his power to deliver it in good condition . So the rating goes to the product itself not the seller . I will not purchase again and I should have known better after reading only one review . The law of average really counts when it comes to reviews . 2 Stars .	-1
I am trying to get away from products that contain zinc , and thought this would be good . Something in it dropped my blood pressure ( usually 110/65 ) to 97/60 . and also made me very nauseous	-1
I received this product yesterday and attempted to use it this morning . Immediately after putting it on my partial and biting down my gums were on fire . I had to remove my partial and had to scrape the product off my gums . Seller does n't want to refund my money as it is already opened and no use to them anymore ( or me ! ) You may want to thoroughly check out this product if you have never used it before.Update : Searching for what was in this product that would burn my gums I found this : polyvinyl acetate ( PVAc ) , a synthetic resin prepared by the polymerization of vinyl acetate . In its most important application , polyvinyl acetate serves as the film-forming ingredient in water-based ( latex ) paints ; it also is used in adhesives . The monomer can be polymerized while dispersed in water to form a milky-white emulsion . This fluid can be processed directly into latex paints , in which the PVAc forms a strong , flexible , adherent film . It can also be made into a common household adhesive known as white glue or Elmer 's glue.When employed in coatings or adhesives , PVAc is often partially hydrolyzed to a water-soluble polymer known as polyvinyl alcohol.I am allergic to latex . Perhaps this is the problem . The lack of customer support/refund from the seller will guarantee them that I will not buy from them again for any product . I am very disappointed .	-1
In my search to find a better denture adhesive , I decided to try this one . It did not provide the stability and/or security of my other adhesive which was EFFERGRIP .	-1
Others have said it more often and well . This just is n't an effective product . I would not recommend it if asked .	-1
I used this for almost a month and felt very werid the whole time I was taking it . I had bad with drawl 's after I stoped the product and found that I actually gained weight instead of losing weight.this is a really bad product .	-1
Sorry , but I had high expectations for this , based on a friend 's experience . This did nothing . Its homepathic , which means they dilute the salt until basically its pure water . You know what does work with lice ? Combing them out and repeating with more traditional shampoos and creams for 2-3 weeks , weekly . Or an actual salt solution . Not this .	-1
I bought this for a family member and here is the thing ; did it work , yes WITH and only WITH the ROBI COMB ( worth the money ) now that thing is awesome . HOWEVER ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! My family member used this product , Licefree , and had a BAD allergic response . One of the inert ingredients is related to ragwweed , 75 % of all people with pollen allergies are at great risk . You can go into shock . It works , but if you have allergies , buy something else . God bless .	-1
I liked this scrub it left my skin clearer and smoother than most of the stuff I bought on Amazon to get rid of milia bumps and dry skin but I 'm a lil freaked out about the ingredients in it . I was thinking that most of it was natural . But this scrub has Stearic Acid and Aluminum Oxide in it like most non natural scrubs do - aluminum crystals ) .Stearic acid causes cancer AT LOW LEVELS plus does damage to your nervous system , brain and can give you respiratory problems . They do n't say if the stearic acid comes from plant/coconut oil or animal fat . Because it does n't say 'from plant/coconut oil ' I 'm thinking it 's probably from animal fat . Plant / coconut oil is ok but stearic acid from animal fat is bad .Theres some other ingrediants in it like Silica and Phenoxyethanol that sound like they could be bad too but have n't looked them up yet.So even though I liked the scrub because of what it did for my face I 'm def not buying it again unless they give more info on the ingrediants . That 's why its getting 2 stars instead of 5 .	-1
I loved this scrub the first time I used it . Nice fine crystals to polish the skin and left my face feeling super smooth . The second time I used it , I had some sort of allergic reaction and my face got hot/red/itchy . Needless to say I 've discontinued use ! You may have a better result though .	-1
I 've only just got round to opening this . My jar arrived unsealed and looked like it had been used . I have n't used it yet but the state of it kind of took the wind out of my sails .	-1
I normally love Clif Bars , but the Coconut Chocolate Chip is way too sweet . I was hoping to try something other than the carrot cake and apricot , however this was a disappointment .	-1
Should have stuck with one of the more well known flavors . This one was strange and just plain nasty . Did n't even really taste like a Clif Bar to be honest . Never finished the box . Gave them away !	-1
I can not agree with most reviewers of this Cliff Bar.It does not taste at all like peanut butter and has an awful foul taste.I had hoped that it would have tasted as good as the mint chocolate Builder 's bar that i got at the gym.Now that is a good tasting bar ...	-1
I love Clif Bars , Crunchy Peanut Butter flavor , I eat about 15 boxes per month but after ordering them twice from Amazon I learned my lesson -- I will NOT buy them from Amazon any more.Both boxes were far from their expiration dates but tasted like they were mishandled and each delivery came 4-9 days after the expected delivery date . In one case the delivery date was changed every day to the next day and when they came there was freezer burn type markings and taste.I would rather spend a few cents extra and purchase them from Advantage Nutrition , they come in 1 day and are always fresh .	-1
Sorry , I am very disappointed and annoyed , with Clif bar and with Amazon.com . I tried to order the Clif peanut butter breakfast bars that I 'd found at my nearby Walmart , that are presently unavailable . I thought they were deliciously different from all others I 'd tried `` on the shelf '' . Found them easily on Amazon so ordered them but am now completely annoyed by the fact that they are not at all like the ones I bought at Walmart , although identically packaged ! After investigating , I now see that there are two sorts of peanut butter bars offered by Clif and Amazon but one must be a detective to distinguish the two ! I am now the proud owner of two huge boxes of soft ( not crunchy , as wanted ) , CHEWY peanut butter bars that I do n't like at all ! I hope to find them at Walmart again but wanted to complain about your presentation of this otherwise terrific product by Clif.Clif Bar Energy Bar Crunchy peanut butter , 2.4 oz 12 count ( pack of 2 ) is not sufficiently different fromClif Crunchy Bar peanut butter 10 count bar boxes ( pack of 2 ) -offering chewy crunchy peanut butter and crunchy peanut butter bars should be perhaps reconsidered.Perhaps dropping the crunchy label in a chewy peanut butter bar could avoid such customer dissatisfaction in future ?	-1
I usually really enjoy these bars but the last ones I received were either old or stale . They had no taste & I am very disappointed .	-1
At 60 yrs old , I 'm just beginning to experiment with different types of bars that are a healthier choice . I learned several good lessons when ordering the Luna Bars . Not all tastebuds are equal ! ! To me they had the strangest taste of any bar I 've tried . To make matters worse , the order got doubled somehow , but I did n't have the heart to send them back since it was my fault . I will take more time to read ALL of the best reviews . I often do this to prevent the kind of problem that happened . I 'd have to look and see what I paid for them , but if anyone is interested , I 'd make you a deal on a box of these Luna Bars . Sorry Luna , you 've got a long way to go ! !	-1
Okay so I was loving Luna bars and eating them almost daily until I came across an article about the process of extracting soy protein isolate . Apparently , in this process a chemical called hexane is used which is a known neurotoxin . Unless the ingredients specifically state that it is organic then the soy protein isolate is most likely extracted using this chemical . I was eating these bars because I thought they were a great nutrition bar , but no longer . There is a list online entitled `` Guide to hexane-extracted soy in nutrition bars '' by the Cornucopia institute which rates these types of bars . Luna Bars are rated with a skull and crossbones . Lovely . I have written an inquiry to the company in order verify this information but they will not contact me back . I advise any eating Luna bars to consider this information and do some research . I personally do not want any extra chemicals in my body !	-1
terrible .	-1
I use to love these bars ! My husband and I ate them every day . We just got the `` new recipe '' and boy , am I disappointed ! Why did you change them ? They are not as good now .	-1
I really disliked these and I love everything lemon so it was quite disappointing . They had a strange texture as well and I ended up throwing most of the box away . I do like the blueberry bliss Luna bars however .	-1
I used one for almost a year with no problems , but when I moved and bought a new one , the stupid blue button got pushed in immediately and I could n't get it out , so I bought another one . First time using it I noticed a slit right in the blue button that opened when I pushed on it.They always leaked , but I dealt with it . The blue botton is the worst idea yet . I give up on it .	-1
I bought one of these and the soap leaked out of the push button within a day or two . Bought another and the same thing happened . Serious design flaws in this model . Do not waste your time and money .	-1
Do not buy this item . I 've bought 2 and both of them leak dish detergent all over the place . A waste of money .	-1
I bought one of these months ago . The little blue button DOES leak sometimes . The handle broke right by the bottom blue part . I went out and bought another one because I liked the product so much . A few weeks into owning the second one , it broke as well , in the SAME place . It also leaked ocasionally . I emailed the company and explained to them what happened and told them I can not buy another one of these because it is a waste of money since it 's just going to break . The company said they are going to send me 2 new ones and that they `` redesigned '' it . I told them I would try them and give them some feedback as to whether they work better.For those of you out there who are experiencing the same problems with it leaking and breaking , please contact the scotch brite company and let them know what is going on . With enough people complaining they will fix it.I will update my review after I have used the new ones they sent me . **UPDATE** The company sent me 2 new wands and some new sponges . The ones they sent me are not the same as these ones , they do n't have the `` button '' thing and the bottom is white , not blue . These ones seem to be working well , have n't broken . I do n't see the point of the `` button '' thing , it really does nothing except leak or break . I am thankful to the company for sending me these new ones , as long as they keep working I will keep using them , but these blue ones with the button on them still deserve only 2 stars . My advice : get the one without the button .	-1
The bristles are hard and do not soften under warm water . It can not be hung from a hook . This listing is for one brush , not three .	-1
You 'll do much better with a Hoky broom or a Swiffer . The bristles on the Oxo Good Grips do a poor job of picking up debris and dust and that which is picked up is difficult to empty into a garbage can .	-1
I 'm really surprised to see such positive reviews for this product . The dustpan is fine , but the broom is ridiculously small . I 'm 5'9 '' and have to bend completely over to use it . It looks like it was made for a child . I 'm really disappointed . I 'm going to have to replace the broom , because this one will kill my back if I try to use it .	-1
Too small for my needs . My fault , though as I should have paid more attention to the size of them .	-1
These are thick and sturdy , but the problem is they are the slickest glove I 've ever used . They 're only slightly slick when handling wet dishes but then add soap and I ca n't hold onto anything . I had to set dishes on the counter to scrub them which is cumbersome and takes way too long . These will be relegated to cleaning the litter box.They are a little larger in sizing than other brands.EDIT : I got to thinking about why the disparity in reviews on this product and wondered if maybe different colors and/or sizes are different . Mine are green size medium and super slick , no grip at all .	-1
I loved these gloves at first . They do n't have great dexterity , but they are durable . But the fabric lining gets a stench that is hard to describe after a while . At that point , I have tried everything to clean them and nothing works or only works a day or so . Who wants to be cleaning the inside of rubber gloves every day ? Either eliminating the lining or making a removable lining would work better . If there was no lining , you could just use a pair of Playtex inside the glove and it would be all around a great product for heavy duty chores.Nuff said .	-1
With in the first minute it broke in half and the half broke in half . Overall it did what I needed but was in 10 pieces before I finished the job .	-1
The pillow is too small and the velcro strip wo n't stay put . Keeps riding up with the cover and loses contact with the chair . Too much money for this product ... a rolled up towel works better for support of the lower back .	-1
This lumbar was super hard and hurt my back . I bought it for use in my car , to replace my less firm version , and had to return it . This product is not recommended .	-1
I have a `` sway back , '' or scoliosis , to a moderate degree . So my lumbar area can really start to ache quickly and intensely . I thought this half roll would be just the ticket , but unfortunately it does n't seem to give me much relief . In fact , right now I am wondering if for some reason it might make it worse . In any event , I have a `` mesh '' back office chair , so the Velcro does not stick to it . ( Which I knew would be the case . ) But the strap , which is removable , does not hold the support in place at all . It simply slides down the chair . So I spend most of my time either pushing/pulling the strap and support back up , or I take the strap off and have to reposition the support constantly while sitting in the chair . Perhaps this gives me a little exercise , but this would not be my first choice of how to get it . In any event , I was thinking the full roll might be better , but then I really do n't think so . It seems to me the problem lies in the fact that the support only sits in one small section of one 's back , kind of causing a lump , if that makes any sense . I think the full-back Orbusforme supports would be better . In fact , I think I still might have one in the garage that I used a long time ago . I 'm sure going to look for it ( even though I may never be seen again ) . Unfortunately , you can not return these once you 've tried them ( taken them out of the package ) .	-1
My wife and I tried this after using another brand of whitening strips . To our dismay , it did n't whiten our teeth , it also has some mediocre performance cleaning them . At least with regular toothpastes , they clean at the same time freshen our breath as well . Waste of money . Like what the other reviewers state , their claim of false packaging may have some merit as the tube contains way less of toothpaste than what is stated . I suggest you stay away or try other brands ... or better yet just go to your dentist if you really like to whiten your teeth .	-1
Used this as directed , and during the application ( within the 2 hours ) , I was n't experiencing any irritation , but that evening ( 4-6 hrs after ) , all my teeth and gums were aching in that unnerving way where you ca n't do anything to stop it . Sucking air in would create so much sensitivity , drinking liquids..nothing really subsided the sensitivity . Went to sleep finally , and by the next day the nerve pain was gone , but I 'm not sure I sensed any whitening results . Probably will avoid these `` rapid '' whitening kits moving forward : (	-1
As a frequent coffee drinker , I 've got the usual caffeine stains . But I am not about to give up my precious coffee . For quite some time I used the Crest whitening products - the 3D toothpaste and , once every few months , the 3D whitening strips . Those worked pretty well , but I thought I 'd give Rembrandt a try.Big mistake . Big , burning mistake . For the record , I do not have sensitive gums or teeth . I followed the direction on this little package of oral napalm to the letter . Within 30 minutes of completing the & # 34 ; treatments & # 34 ; , the burning sensation in my mouth began . By the next day , I was in excruciating pain and reduced to a liquid diet . Ever run a steak through a blender and tried to eat the pureed results ? I have now , thanks to Rembrandt . Little did I know the joys and wonders yet to come as my gums turned bright red with horrifyingly white spots scattered about , followed by the delightful effect of the gum tissue starting to die and fall off over the next couple days.I wish I 'd saved using this product for late October , as the effect of bright red gums with hunks of dead tissue would have added to a zombie costume quite nicely .	-1
REMBRANDT IS A GOOD NAME BUT IT DOES NOT WORK AS WELL FOR BLEEDING GUMS . I WOLD NOT BUY IT AGAIN	-1
Literally more than half the tube was empty . rembrandt uses plastic tubing that does n't stay collapsed when you squeeze so it always looks like a full tube . On initial opening you 'll discover that you 've just paid for premium packaging and not product . My whole family hated the taste of it . Flat and dull	-1
I read all the reviews and decided to give this product a try so I bought 2 . I followed the directions and even kept the mouthwash longer then the minute but my teeth are not any whiter . No even a small change . I did like the fresh mint and left my mouth fresh and minty .	-1
This stuff really does n't work very well , and it leaves a very sticky residue all over the place . Definitely not worth it , no sting or not . It just does n't do the job .	-1
I just returned this `` piece of crap '' charger to the store . Man , what a disappointment . Oooh , yeah , it charges those batteries pretty darn quickly . But , uh oh , do n't think you 're gon na get to use the batteries for longer than 15 minutes without needing to recalibrate them . Geesh , I thought I really hit the jackpot with this when I bought it for my Canon Powershot A630 , but the product turned out to be a dud . I charged them first , because I did n't trust that they come charged out of the box . Then , I put the `` re-charged '' batteries into my camera and , I kid you not , no less than 15 minutes after doing so the camera indicated to me that the batteries were low . So , I charged them again , and again , after placing them in the camera , it indicated to me that the batteries were low after only a few minutes of usage this time . So , I toted it back to the store , got my money back and bought the Sanyo Eneloop Re-Charger . To say that the Eneloop works better would be too much like telling the truth . But , it outshines the UnEnergiz-ed `` re-charged '' batteries absolutely . If you can get it to work for you , awesome ! If you buy it and find that it does n't work well , then `` I told you so . ''	-1
Worked good for a while , until it stopped . One of the probes crapped out ( the smoker # 2 probe ) which is actually the one I rarely use . It reads 150+ degrees all of the time after the 3rd time using it . I can buy a single replacement probe for $ 15 . It would be nearly the same cost per probe to buy a new thermometer . The replacement wont be this one , though .	-1
its a pain to to link up have to take off battery cover to turn on and it burned up after only a few uses	-1
I tried this on a few items , and some it worked on and some it messed up ( removed color , did n't remove stains , etc . ) So be very careful with it , and try it first on a hidden test area .	-1
As one reviewer has already stated , '' Color Catchers are not magical . '' Strongly dyed items should be sent through one or more washes alone using Color Catchers to test for excessive bleeding . Color Catchers do not suck color out of fabric , they merely collect it a little more effectively than many fabrics washed in mixed color loads . Using Color Catchers can help minimize transfer of color and help keep whites whiter . That being said , my experience indicates that there are OTHER BRANDS of dye grabbers on the market that are MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE .	-1
this is the worth product ever ! i used this as directed in cold water gentle cycle only to open my front loader and found my clothing blotched with random colors and the sheet was a violet color ... .my load of delicates and new clothing valued at $ 300 was destroyed ! do not use .	-1
These vitamins are simply too hard to swallow . I have to break them in half . When I run out of these I will be looking for somethingin Capsul form not tablet .	-1
If you really believe and you can loose or gain 3 lbs within 30 seconds , this scale might be right for you . I do n't think it is compatible with earthly gravity though . Totally useless .	-1
Just did n't work for me . The issue was the hard sides hurt my ankle when I walked , and the pad under the heel was bothering me , too bulky . I went to the ASO laceup level III and it 's much better .	-1
I have n't tried to use this very often , but it does n't seem to work the way I thought it would . I may have to try another brand .	-1
Save your money on this item , really think about what you are buying before you do it . You are blowing in and sucking air out of a `` breath limiter '' . I think buying baloons and blowing into them might be a better use of your time and might better affect your breathing . The nice thing about it is , it fits in your mouth nicely and is easy to use.However , it is hard to clean , no real way to keep the adjustment settings consistent ( as you have to turn a nut on a screw to adjust the setting and it wobbles around all the time and ca n't be placed back after washing the product ) , it is unpleasant to blow in and suck out , I did it for 2 weeks twice a day and do n't feel any different ... All this being said , maybe I did n't do something righ or maybe it didnt work for me as it should have.I do not reccomend you buy this product . Save your money , go run , swim etc ...	-1
It was pretty good and reasonably accurate for as long as it worked . But within less than a year it went bad . For no good reason it suddenly shows a completely wrong weight . I 'm tired of fancy looking products that do n't last .	-1
Well , it lasted from 4/2010 to 9/2013 , but then it just died . It was cheap , but I would expect to last a little longer .	-1
I can weigh myself on this scale in the morning and go back 20 minutes later , not having eaten anything or changed clothes , and I 'll be a half a pound heavier . I bought a digital scale with the ounces so I could track my weight day to day but this scale simply is n't accurate enough for that .	-1
Do n't buy this garbage , it barely gets warm even on the highest setting ! It was a total waste of money and I do n't wish this piece of garbage upon no one else . It warms up ( barely ) then turns itself off . So I got NO relief from my knee pain from this item . Amazon is great I 'm sending it back for a full refund . I will buy this item somewhere else . And this item is n't real cheap as it should be since it is defective !	-1
It gets takes about 10 minutes to get medium warm even when it is set at the highest temperature setting . It never gets hot . I think that it has some sort of timer limitation because it seems to cool off after 20 minutes or so even if I leave it at the highest temperature setting .	-1
When this pad worked I liked it , but I 've had issues with it . My mom and I have the same pad , and we had the same problem . It seems like there is a short somewere in the wireing because the when I used it , it would switch on and off many times and the red light wold blink very rapidly . I always knew it would n't turn on if the red off light was blinking fast . I think this same short caused this very dangerous problme . I woke up today and turned my pad on and I smelled something scorched . I looked around and I was n't sure what it was . I left my room and came back , I layed back down and the smell got worse . I picked up the pad and where the chord met the first part of the clip , it sparked and a fairly good sized flame sprang up . I 'm so glad that I was in the room or my bed would have caught on fire . I was really shaken and upset because I would have been hurt and the heating pad was only a little over a year old . I would have expected that for what I paid for it it would have been safer .	-1
I ordered two of these heating pads and paid more because it looked like they have a better cover , instead of the usual cheap cotton cloth cover that looks like a rag after being washed once ... well , they do have a different cover , but the listing on Amazon did n't say that the pads SHUT-OFF after ONE HOUR . I am capable of turning off a heating pad by myself , and do n't need/want any auto shutoff . These two heating pads are going right back . I can get the regular heating pads that do n't have auto shutoff down at the the local discount store for half the price .	-1
This is terrible and god awful . If you for some unknown reason want to get a nice quick heat up for about 10 minutes and then carry on with whatever it is you may be doing . Then please , buy this , because that is all you are going to get . This is actually quite funny , but the actual remote , is the only thing that stays heated the whole time and almost gets too hot to touch . It isnt even part of the pad ! ! ! I 've already wasted my money on this and am well passed getting a refund , sadly , but I have used it enough times to say that this is pure garbage . I thought that maybe it had to be worn in or something , that maybe , its like a pair of new shoes . HA ! That was a joke and I was only kidding myself . I wish I had checked out other reviews before buying this , but at the time , I had no idea that not all heating pads are created equally and this is whats on the other end of the spectrum ( the terrible side ) ... Dont buy this .	-1
What I really wanted was theBodyMed ZZHP1427 14 '' X 27 '' Electrical Digital Moist Heating Padbut it simply was n't in the budget . I saw this SoftHeat pad at Walmart for $ 20 and decided to take a chance . I got home , checked here on Amazon , and realized I 'd bought the pad I had specifically not wanted based on the reviews . But I already had it in my hands and because of the reviews knew to pay attention to the controller getting hot . At first I made sure I never fell asleep with it on , just in case . I 've had it for a month now and I 'm actually quite pleased . I still wish for a pad that 's a good 6 inches longer AND wider but this is way better than what I 'd been using for years . I 've used it virtually every day to help with my fibromyalgia pain , often several times a day , and I jokingly call it my new best friend.I 've noticed the controller getting a bit warm at times but nothing outside of what I would expect . I 'm one who likes the 1-hour shut-off -- this works really well for me , especially because the pad heats up pretty quickly . The lowest setting is almost always warm enough for me and I 've never used more than the 2nd setting . ( I do put it under my legs or behind my back so that helps it feel warmer than if it were laying on top of me . ) It 's worked perfectly for me , served me very well in the month that I 've had it . I 'm so glad I `` accidentally '' bought it . I still would n't mind having the BodyMed pad but this one has been great and I 'm hoping it will last me a good long time.UPDATE 27 April 2012 : Unfortunately the heating pad did n't last me a good long time . I had noticed it was n't heating as well over the past couple weeks . When I went to use it today , it would n't heat properly at all and the control was malfunctioning -- turning off right away , light blinking on the highest heat setting , things like that . So , it 's toast . Maybe near-daily use was too much to ask for an inexpensive product and it would work fine for people who do n't use it much but I can no longer recommend it . I 've lowered my rating from 5 stars to 2 and will soon be purchasing the pad listed in my initial review .	-1
When this pad is fired up , there is a burst of high heat for a while before it settles down to whatever setting you 've put it on . Even if you only want low heat , you 're going to get a burst of higher heat for a while first . It is comfortable , but it did not last well , and I can not recommend it .	-1
I have been using the Ovulite going on 5 months now . Not once has it shown me partial ferning or full ferning leading up to ovulation or during it . Even though I have had temperature shifts while BBT'ing , cervical mucus changes , and positive OPKs , and High/Peak readings on my Clearblue Easy Fertility monitor ( high reading signifies estrogen surge , peak reading : LH surge ) . I have followed the directions very closely and still no ferning . Maybe I am just one of the few it does n't work for , but it was certianly a waste of money for me .	-1
I bought this hoping it would help me know when I 'm going to , or about to ovulate because I am very irregular.I followed the directions EXACTLY , and looked through the scope and could see nothing ... no dots , no ferns . I tried it every day , and tried it when an ovulation predictor kit told me I was ovulating , and still saw nothing.It was a complete waste of money .	-1

First two stars for easy to use . I felt not as effective in treating slightly swollen painful hemorrhoids as compared to Hemspray Hemmorroid Relief Spray ( Non alcohol ) when Amazon carried it . I actually felt some slight burning sensation which may be due to one of the *ingredients . I gave this a try since Blairex Hem-spray became unavailable . *Active ingredient 1 % Pramoxine [ ... ] side-effects . Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away : redness , irritation , swelling , burning , stinging , or pain at affected areadryness at affected area*Inactive ingredients : aloe barbadensis leaf juice , denatonium benzoate , ethyl alcohol , polysorbate 20 , t-butyl alcohol , tocopheryl acetate , water .	-1
I bought one of these thinking it 'd be great for my dry throat . I got it and I have to say I feel kind of stupid . All it does is heats up water . For 30 bucks I was expecting something like an aroma therapy machine with loads of included materials . Nope , it comes with 1 scented ring and you ca n't load it with any kind of oil . My advice is just go heat a pot of water and stick your head over it . It 'll do the exact same thing as this but probably better .	-1
I tried this twice , meant to return it , but waited too long . You 're supposed to sit it on a table and lower your face over it for ten minutes . It 's really uncomfortable . If you get too close , it 'll burn your lips , face , or eyes . If you 're too far , you do n't feel like you 're getting enough steam . There 's a resivior about 1/4 cup inside for the water . It literally brings the water to a full boil . It 's pretty scary hearing it boil four inches from your face . It 's uncomfortable hanging your head down that long and it says not to rest your face on the rubbery part . Now I have this thing I ca n't use and do n't feel comfortable giving away . I 'm just going to stick with standing by my room vaporizer or using a simmering pot of water on the stove . I should 've known better than buying such a gadget .	-1
Steam is not enough , but the worst problem is the horrible , strong plastic smell ... please stay away from this product . I am retuning mine today	-1
It 's 'OK ' for what it is . It could produce more steam . Also , you have to have your neck and head bent over for 15 or so minutes straight until all the water evaporates . It would be nice to be able to lay back and inhale . Besides those down falls it works good for what it is .	-1
Produces too little steam for my `` taste '' .Even if the manufacturer believes that 's all the steam anybody needs , or should take , I do n't think it 's too hard to put an option of generating more steam for people like me.Other than the quantity of steam produced by this thing , everything else seems okay . The quality of material used , the shape and the way it fits on the mouth/nose etc.But because of the amount of steam produced , I almost never use it so I am not a great judge of other factors.Overall for me personally it ended up being a waste of money .	-1
Although it should be used regularly it is not . Steam produced can be dangerous to young children . Must be supervised by adult . Sometimes it seems too much work for the outcome gained .	-1
I bought this recently and I still have my older one ( from another company ) . This one has little steam . I waited and waited for the steam to come up but it was n't much steam . So I just use my old one , Kaz Therasteam .	-1
This steamer is way too hot to have a face that close . I used it and burnt my face right away- had to return this product . You will be better off boiling water in a pot and using a towel overhead to use the steam .	-1
I am very disappointed in this product ! ! First of all it 's way too small . Next the rubber mask where you put your face is a flemsy rubber . Most of all , you have to keep replacing the Vics disks or pads to use with this . It gets costly , because the disks are not cheap .	-1
I bought this because it looked like an upgrade to my Conair facial sauna/steamer for inhaling steam with the adjustable steam control and soft face mask . What I do n't understand is how anyone can inhale this steam . The pot where the water boiled is PLASTIC coated with TEFLON ( or some non-stick coating ) . I would n't rate the product badly just based on seeing that there 's plastic in it , but you can clearly smell the plastic/teflon in the steam . Some people say it 's the soft plastic in the mask ( as if it makes a difference where it 's coming from , it all goes to your lungs ) but I took it off and smelled the steam directly and the smell is definitely coming from the boiling plate . Maybe the smell goes away after a number of uses , but that 's because you 've inhaled it all by that point . Would you boil tea in a plastic teflon coated kettle and inhale the steam while it 's heating up ? I 'll stick with the Conair unit even though it does n't have the extra little features because the boiling pot is made of uncoated metal and the face mask is a hard rigid plastic ( less comfortable but less smelly ) .	-1
Put plainly , this pedometer does not work as advertised . I specifically paid the rather steep price for this pedometer in order to have one that could be kept in a pocket rather than on a belt clip . It does not work at all when in a pocket . When using the belt clip the pedometer accurately records forceful strides on hard surfaces such as roads and long linoleum hallways . It drastically undercounts leisurely walking such as in your home and also drastically undercounts walking on carpet . Depending on the day 's schedule I estimate it undercounts by 25-40 % . Perhaps it would work better for a heavier person ( I am 130 lbs ) . This pedometer does have a nice feature set as described in the product description , but I do not recommend this pedometer for the person trying to achieve their daily 10,000 steps . The only use I could recommend it for is to measure your workout on a sidewalk or road .	-1
I bought this based on all of the positive reviews . I liked the idea of being able to put this in my purse or pocket and walk . I was dissapointed.It was very big . There is a clip on the back of it but if you clip it to your pants to log your steps be prepared for it to fall off . The clip is located in such a place that it makes it top heavy and the clip ca n't hold it on to what you put it on.It over counted steps . By a lot . Several reviewers have mentioned this . I tested it against myself counting and against another pedometer I have and this one had more steps logged every time . Sometimes the difference was in the 100 's that it had over counted . When I bought a new/better pedometer it too came in lower than the steps this one counted . IF you want an accurate count- do n't get this one . If you want a boost in steps you have walked- this one might work for you.There were other things that I found that I did n't like about this one . Several times buttons were pushed when I had this in my pocket . The buttons were not set low enough in to keep them from being pushed.What a huge dissapointment . I would not have bought this pedometer had I known these things . Read the other five star reviews carefully and you will find they too had problems with this thing ; they just felt the pros outweighed the cons .	-1
When I think of a pedometer , I think of a device that measures walking distance . So does Omron , apparently , or they would n't have you input your stride length . But if you want to measure the distance from point A to point B , then point B to point C and so forth , they are on a different page . There is simply no way to reset the steps.I set out to measure the streets in my community ( nineteen of them ) only to discover that in addition to writing down the length of the first street measured , I had to subtract that length from the total when the next street was measured . Well , the previous street plus the distance between streets . There is no way to reset steps . What if a pedometer is shared between two people ? I can understand leaving out a common sense feature if it raises the cost or increases the number of buttons ( complexity ) , but there are countless devices where you activate a feature by pressing two buttons together , or by pressing one button for three seconds . It would have cost Omron nothing to include the reset feature.The pedometer is apparently excellent for daily totals , if that 's what one is after.UPDATE : Calculated yesterday 's street measurements and found out they were screwy . I tested the unit and discovered it would stick from time to time . It finally stuck on 632 steps ( down from nine thousand something ) . I pressed Mode and it went to zero . Hooray , the missing feature I was looking for . Too bad the rest of the features are not working now . I will say that this product is well ahead of the average maid in China failure rate , so maybe I 'll take a chance on another one .	-1
I do n't know how to properly rate this . Nice looking piece and an easy-wear . However , I could never get it set so that I got a proper feed . Disappointing .	-1
I liked this at first . I REALLY did . How did it change to my giving this a ONE-STAR ? The first thing I noticed about this product was it 's CRAPPY clip . It looks all sleek and perfect but the clip is just there to look like it can be clipped on . Functionality-wise ? TERRIBLE . So , they gave you an extra lanyard/strap that you clip on as insurance in case the clip does n't stay on your pants ' waist , belt or wherever ... which falls off far too many times a day to count . The mere act of sitting down then getting up could release the clip from your clothing , so I quickly learned to constantly check that my Omron pedometer still clung to me . That safety/insurance strap saved me from losing this thing on many an occasion ! Then something else started to happen ... This very insurance strap/clip began to come off as well because its mini-clip began to lose friction/resistance while opening and closing . Although it did n't happen often , the fact that it did , was cause for concern . Lo ' and behold , one day I was at the beach with Puppy and what do you know , I felt for my pedometer and it was missing . Needless to say it was impossible to find at the beach ... My new theory is this - if you 've got some washboard abs , the probability of this happening might be less . Maybe the slight pressure from my non-washboard-abs prevented this from staying clipped to my clothes ? Who knows.It 's sad that instead of getting into the more important features of this pedometer , I had talk about the clip ! As for the functionality of the pedometer itself , it was very easy to set up and use . I liked that it had a seven-day memory function that let me see my results for each of the past seven days . It also motivated me to try and walk even more ! I liked the & # 34 ; Aerobic Steps & # 34 ; category which measures your aerobic activity , but downside is that it started counting after 10 minutes of straight activity ( this feature could be improved on because if you 're interval training every few minutes , it wo n't measure anything as & # 34 ; aerobic & # 34 ; ) . Before losing this , I was able to use it for a good two months . Thinking back now , it was a pain to constantly have to worry about whether it fell off ( also because it needs to stay upright and between certain angles in order for the pedometer to register your steps ) ... My suggestion would be to get the updated version of this pedometer which I recently discovered was better in all ways , including clippage . My other suggestion would be to check out the latest pedometer by Ozeri .	-1
I did not like it because , it does not stay in place , you have to connect it in certain way , not practical at all .	-1
I read the instruction manual , trying to follow the steps as to get it to start working , and could n't get it to set up anything . DO NOT buy this if you are at all technologically challenged as I am ( usually if the instruction manual is clear , which this seemed to be , I still have difficulties getting the product set up ) .So , I am off to try and find a non `` bells and whistles '' pedometer ( which this one apparently is not !	-1
I have to admit that I was previously spoiled . I had a FitBit One which was dead-on every time . However , I lost it because it was so tiny and I 'm so absent-minded . It was too expensive to repurchase , but I replaced it with the Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket Pedometer . I 'm not too happy with it . It 's not accurate .	-1
My ultimate interest in this product was to show me how many calories I was burning throughout a day in all the activities I did . All this counted was steps so it really was not what I wanted and possibly they do n't make the type of device I thought I was getting .	-1
The pedometer does n't work . My old one broke so I decided to purchase this new fancy one . What a waste of money . I walk 3.5 miles with a friend daily . I first carried in my bag it registered the steps over 6700 steps but the miles were off so I decided to put in on my hip . Nothing changed . What a waste of money .	-1
Instructions were not easy to follow . Font size was small . Easy to accidentally push the stop button while wearing it , results for the entire day were lost .	-1
I bought this because I wanted a pedometer that I can drop in my pocket . It 's nice looking and comfortable . The features are nice . It 's easy to set . Customer service is great . Trouble is , this pedometer , regardless of the numerous glowing reviews , is inaccurate.A 12 step auto filter counteracts bouncing in the pocket , but causes the pedometer to undercount during daily movement by about 50 % during tests on the waist.I have personally tested this pedometer against numerous other pedometers and find it inferior.I 'm now wearing a Yamax Power Walker and like it . I would not recommend any Omron pedometer for the reason stated above.- Susanna K. Hutcheson	-1
I really liked this product until it kept coming off my belt , waistband , or whatever I clipped it to . I bought a second one for my husband as I was so happy with it , but this one did exactly the same thing.When they work they are excellent , but please beware that when they slip off your waistband onto concrete , or tile , then the damage is done .	-1
It 's calibrated poorly . Completely inaccurate . I 'll try re-calibrating it . But , not very hopeful . I owned a cheaper one that worked better : (	-1
This pedometer seems accurate and easy to use . But as mentioned by multiple reviewers , the clip on this is not strong enough nor long enough.I have had the Omron 112 Pedometer for 1 month and it has fallen off my waist almost daily . The little extra string clip thing that the pedometer comes with is also useless . I 'm expecting to lose it permanently at any time now.I 'm definitely not going to buy this the next time around .	-1
When I ordered this Item there was a Picture posted with the Pedometer showing 4 buttons , one was to RESET it by hand , so you do n't have to wait till midnight for the Item to do it automatically , and that 's the model I wanted and ordered ... ..well , guess what ? They send me the Pedometer that every one gets , with the three buttons , since I was n't aware of it and had already cut the plastic casing to get to the unit , I could n't send it back , so I 'm Stuck with it ! I will never order from this seller again !	-1
Omron disappointed me , this does not work at all . When you get something new like this you want to test it to see if it worked but this doesn't.I put it on and went about my business cleaning and doing my chores . Wow K walked 2 miles in the short time ? Not likely . So I decided to go for a walk on a trail that has 1/4 mile increments posted . I am very angry I waited for it to zero out overnight so I had no miles on it . I held it by the string so no bumping to rack up the miles . I walked 10 steps to my car and looked down and it said 30 steps . Really ? Oddly it did not add miles while I drove but I stepped out of the car and it added 25 steps . I walked 10 steps and it added 50 steps . I am done this does n't work and it shows that I walked 2.5 miles and used up only 82 calories . Not good ... .	-1
I was kind of excited to get this scale . As excited as one could be that is . I am dieting and I want to see a nice accurate picture of weight loss . I , too , like many of the others decided that I did not want all the bells and whistles and thought myHealth o Meter HDM560DQ-05 Digital Weight Tracking Scale , Blackmight be a little too complex . I thought I would move toward simplicity . Ok ... so I thought I was headed in the right direction.I unpacked the behemoth of a scale ( this one is really long and large and you might want to think of space available for it ) . This goes far beyond the space for a bathroom scale . But I knew that by reading the other reviews on here . I was ready to make the room because this scale looked worth it . It cost more than some of the others in it 's class - so I thought cost might equate to quality . In this case , not so.When I anxiously unpacked my scale and took out the key ( I turned the scale upside down to do this ) the plastic lens from the dial came off . As I inspected the scale further ( and attempted to re-seat the lens into the bezel ) I quickly realized that this scale was made using cheap materials . That chrome bezel that looks so pretty in the picture ... it 's plastic ! When I saw the tabs on the lens and the slots in the bezel that lined up I realized that the tabs were too small and the lens would never stay put with any minimal jostling . I would forever be wrestling with a plastic lens coming off and dust and grime getting into the dial ... not to mention condensation if in a bathroom.I currently use my Health-o-meter weight loss scale and it 's definitely better than this one - but I wanted the simplicity and large numbers because of eyesight ( I have MS and my eyesight stinks ) . Another design flaw I saw was mentioned by another reviewer . The dial to calibrate the scale to zero is right under the dial . This could be moved by a toe , a shoe , etc . Too easy to access and too easy to move that dial . Like most other scales , a spot under the top or bottom edge would have sufficed . The dial might be large , but the numbers are written in a sans serif font that is n't even bolded and becomes difficult to read , especially if eyesight is any issue at all . The dial is pretty , but it 's difficult to read . How about that plastic lens - what happens if it starts to get scratches on it and the dial becomes even more difficult ot read ? What about all the plastic ... will it hold up to bathroom condensation over time ? ? ? ? This could have been a nice scale , but I think they should send it back to the design shop or cut the price in half . I expected better quality all around and a little more thought put into the design . The scale may look sturdy ... but looks can be deceiving . If I thought that this scale would have been worth it , I would have returned mine for an exchange because defects happen . Instead , I decided to go for a refund and will either stick with my current digital scale or look for something less cheaply made.1 star .	-1
My scale arrived today . First , I was totally shocked by how much floor space it takes up . It 's huge , but it 's hard to read . The little marks between each 10 pounds are impossible for me to read even with my reading classes . For example , I can read 110 or 120 and I can even see where 115 is , but nothing beyond that . So if you 're content knowing your weight within 5 pounds , then this might be the scale for you . Also , if you 're under 35 , you might be able to see this scale just fine . After using a `` doctor 's scale '' for the last 20 years , I ca n't adjust to this . I 'm sending mine back .	-1
I supposed that this works for most people . I guess that my condition just does n't seem to work . This was for plantar facia , which I have .	-1
I hate the chemical smell in this product . I am switching to organic cleaning products . I bought this by mistake . It has some natural Lavender EO in it but also chemical fragrance and it is overpowering ! Even my hubby said so and he has poor sense of smell . Too bad	-1
Pros : Natural , & # 34 ; green & # 34 ; , smells niceCons : Does n't really clean , more like scented waterI have only had black granite counter tops for about 6 months . They are proving to be as tough to keep clean as I was warned . There is a bit of a pattern in my beautiful granite but it is constantly streaked and full of fingerprints . To look pristine , it must first be wiped with a damp cloth , then wiped with a light scrubber sponge and dawn soap . Then it must be fully dried with a SOFT dish towel . The final step is a spray of Weiman Granite Cleaner & Polish and a buff with a dry SOFT dish towel . My kitchen used 2 full slabs of granite and I get a workout with these counters . I have tried Sprayway , Meyer 's , Method and Simple Green and have not found a thing that will help me with one-step cleaning . Also , if food spills are not picked up immediately , they require lots of scrubbing to restore to their natural beauty . If anyone has a better product out there , please let me know !	-1
The tool is well designed and works as expected . Unfortunately , you have to apply so much pressure to use it to grab something and the aluminum handle is heavy when pointed upwards to pick up something from up top . Also grabber just is n't wide enough to pick up very much . My arm still hurts from using it to try to get toilet paper off the top shelf .	-1
This pick-up tool will not hold a can of pop or canned food products - great idea - lousy engineering - okay for light duty , but nothing more - can not be trusted with overhead items of any weight - there are much better products on the market for the price .	-1
Not very easy to use . If you do manage to pick something up with it usually falls multiple times and requires several attempts	-1
I returned this for a shorter one because it was actually too long and cumbersome for my needs . Well made .	-1
at first this did n't seem too heavy but after picking up anything or even picking up just the grapper by itself it was just too heavy for my forearm and hand . I 'm not taking ibuprofen because of the strain from its weight . I 'm a 39-year-old healthy gal that just happen to have back surgery so I doubt this would be any easier at all for an elderly person to use regularly . also the hands bend easily . I have another one that I wanted to improve upon but I am back to using the old regular one with more of a trigger like on a gun that you pull your forefinger with as opposed to pushing down on . It 's much much easier on the fingers hand wrist forearm and elbow by far	-1
This is a comparatively heavy tool to use . I had expected something considerably more lightweight . However , the most frustrating thing about this reaching device is the pair of grippers . They are inflexible ; if you try to pick up ANYTHING cylindrical , they simply ca n't do it , particularly if it weighs more than a soda can ( for instance , a cylindrical bottle of shampoo is too much for this device ) . I like the handle that can be squeezed , rather than the trigger-style of the competitive `` Gopher '' tool , but if the other end ca n't grip anything , what good is it ? The pads on the `` finger '' ( for lack of a better term ) need to be at least SOMEWHAT flexible to conform to the shape of things that are n't rectangular.It is also a bit long for a short person ( 5 feet tall ) such as myself ; I ca n't grip the handle with one hand and still reach the item I 've grabbed . I have to set it on some sort of surface , release the handle , and THEN pick it up . The Gopher has it beat there - I can lock the device on whatever I 've picked up , and then easily transfer the item to my other hand.So - close , but still needs improvement , and REALLY needs to drop some weight in the body of the device .	-1
Ca n't tell if this is the real deal -- so I have stopped using it . The plastic smell has yet to dissipate , and this makes it unusable . Great idea , though , and I will be looking for an authentic Chillow .	-1
It is not what it touts to be-the first noc I used it , I awoke with a migraine headache AND the pillow was hot not cool . I have tried to contact the company without success . On the pillow in the lower right hand corner of the blue side there is a web site to go to in order to confirm it is really their pillow . The site is no longer a site . I would NOT recomend it-it was a waste of my money . If I could return it , I would . It sounds like a marvelous idea but it does not perform in the manner it is suppose to per the commericals .	-1
I would have loved this pillow , except that when I filled it up , one of the seams had a leak . To give amazon credit , the return was quick and easy and I got my refund the day I shipped it back .	-1
Meh . Out of the other brands on the market I bet this is tops . That said , I do n't get it . My wife liked it but it became a big pain in the *** as it got twisted while she slept and the stuff inside got overturned on itself ( it 's got some kind of foam sheet that is nigh impossible to straighten out once twisted about ( imagine a bend memory foam pillow inside a pillow case that you ca n't open ) . It became a weekly ritual for her to become frustrated with it and I had to fix it . it disappeared one day and I honestly have no clue where it is and it makes me happy to say so .	-1
Had I know it was plastic and heavy and not worth - would never have spend the moneyWASTE in my opinion - not worth giving it a second try	-1
A little awkward to use but works as advertised in keeping my head cool . Warms up after 4/5 hours but still useable . Buy it from Chillow directly , though , as Amazon charged double Chillow 's price and I only got one . Chillow sends 2 for 1/2 Amazon price.Update after a few weeks use . This product is very awkward to use on a daily basis . It is heavy and `` bunches '' up under the pillow case . Fear of leakage also is a concern . For these reasons , I have gone back to a standard pillow . The ads for this product never mentioned the `` water requierment ' . I would not reccomend this product !	-1
From the first day the control unit got so hot I was afraid it would start a fire . It would heat up even when it was off , which I do n't understand . So after the first time I never used it again . I should have returned it . But did n't . I did need a heating pad just like this and used to have one just like this that I loved . But I guess that was before the Chinese started making them .	-1
Have had this heating pad for a month and a half ... it has stopped working all together now ... While it worked its high setting was hot but not that hot , ... honestly i miss those old ones your grandparents had ... they worked ... . Period these kinda work and then not for long .	-1
This heating pad really does n't get all that hot to get deep into the muscle like it should . I bought a much cheaper one at Wal-**** that gets nice and hot for thoes deep down muscle aches .	-1
This product is two pieces of plastic held together by a weak rubber band . It is not effective in squeezing a tube of toothpaste .	-1
I bought this because it was SPF 30 , and because I -- prior to using this product -- had had nothing but positive experiences with ChapStick products.This item , however , was another story ... and I should perhaps not be surprised that it tastes like chemicals , given that it is impregnated with 4 chemical sunblocks . I 've used lip balms that had a physical sunblock in them ( specifically , zinc oxide ) , and I not only did n't 'taste ' ( and thus 'eat ' ) the product , but it actually stayed on my lips -- whereas this stuff was like slathering some 'grease ' on my lips , and it kept 'sliding ' ( both 'on ' my lips , and into my mouth , apparently ) .The ChapStick Ultra ingredient list includes mention of `` Artificial Flavor '' -- and while it is not clear ( at all ) just what that artificial `` flavor '' is supposed to taste like , if anything , what is clear is that if its role was to 'mask ' the chemical taste from the 4 chemical sunblock ingredients , then it failed miserably.I could n't bring myself to try this more than 2 times , it was just too disgusting to taste -- let alone to 'realize ' that by experiencing taste , it meant that I was inadvertently *ingesting* the product -- and it includes 4 chemical sunblocks , which are *not meant to be ingested* -- and it was just a neverending 'process ' of experiencing that taste ( while the ChapStick Ultra product was on my lips , that is -- after wiping it off , I still had to do a little something 'extra ' , to get the remnant aspect off of my lips ( I basically had to use soap ) , in order to stop experiencing that taste ) .I wish I could recommend this product , but I can't.Lastly , it amazes me that there are some reviews in which folks state that they did not find there to be any chemical taste -- I have to wonder whether any of those folks happen to be smokers , given that many who smoke have an impaired/dampened sense of taste . Regardless , I most definitely found there to be a chemical taste , and others have , too . This product needs to be revamped . As is , it 's a conduit for ingesting chemical sunblock ingredients , and has a definite ( and gross ) chemical taste .	-1
Organic copper , usually a chelate ) is used in all good vitamins . Cupric sulfate is bad because it goes straight to your brain . These links tell the story. [ ... ] [ ... ]	-1
Marketing . This is what Centrum is all about . It 's sold as & # 34 ; the medical solution for your problems & # 34 ; pretty much like on the western days . And like that , it is n't any kind of miracle.The 50+ edition is just something focused on , for example , men 's needing more testosterone so they include something to boost it up.You 'll be better server with other supplements pack that might come more expensive but are WAY better , like animal pack .	-1
actually there is no expiry time on the bottle . how can we take it safely ? ? there is a label covering the LOT EXP time . I totally ca n't understand why this kind of goods can be sold on AMAZON . I just put it into trash bin , wasted my money and time . Totally the most awful shopping experience fm AMAZON . And I will leave this seller into black list .	-1
I ordered these thinking ithelp save some time decoration . I didn'tknow they would as hard as a brick and about as sweet as day old rocks .	-1
We got these from another store and they are cute and nice and colorful . They also totally stick to the paper , and you ca n't get the paper pulled off . You pull one off and the paper sticks to the back like it 's glued on . Better packaging would easily fix this problem .	-1
I got this for my husband who is having a lot of difficulty with his vision . He had a very hard time finding the & # 34 ; sweet spot & # 34 ; on this magnifier . He finally gave up and went back to an older one . I do n't recommend this item , based on his experience .	-1
I 've been taking them daily , dual dose ( 4 pills , instead of 2 ) , for the past 2 months ... Truth is , I do n't know if they 're working or not.They do seem to make the genitals more sensitive , almost like they have a bit of viagra mixed in them ; though the effect only becomes somewhat noticeable after taking the pills for 2 weeks or something ( unlike viagra which usually works within a few minutes to an hour ) .Wife is still not pregnant ; though there could be a million and one reasons as to why.Often you only read about the positive comments , and nothing about the environment . If the only thing these pills do , is make a man more sensitive , and make him want more sex , it 's only natural that the chances increase for conception.So , no results for me yet !	-1
Been using this product for over 18 months and doctor said their has n't been any improvments since taking this product .	-1
I am only 5 foot tall but these are too short ( medium and large ) . There is so much spandex that they pinch my toes together actually causing pain . Tried getting large ( I weight 125 lbs ) but still too short , pinch toes and fall down .	-1
I bought the Biotone massage lotion hoping that it would be a good lotion to use on my daughter , who is a gymnast . I often rub her sore muscles and wanted a massage lotion similar to the one my massage therapist uses on me ( he buys a special brand in 5 gallon containers ... way more than I need ) .The Biotone lotion got such good reviews , I was hoping it would be as good as the professional brand my therapist uses . I was sadly disappointed . Its staying power is very short-lived , and the & # 34 ; high glide & # 34 ; quality of it lasts for about one minute . I find myself applying more every couple of minutes in order to retain the right amount of friction . My daughter does not have dry skin , so I do n't understand why it seems to absorb so quickly , truly like a lotion you might buy at the store . I have found it does n't work much better than my Bath and Body Works hand cream . It does claim to absorb clean , like a lotion , but again , I would have expected it to not absorb quite so fast.Even thought it says it is unscented , it does have a very faint odor . Nothing bad , but not completely unscented . It did not affect my ratings.Overall , I would not recommend this lotion .	-1
I did n't care how much these were as long as they worked well . Unfortunately , these tweezers did n't work too much better than the standard Revlon pair from CVS . Sharp point , but do n't grip every time .	-1
I was disappointed with the product because I 've seen so many good reviews of it ( I think it was rated highest among all I 've found ) , however , in my case it did n't help at all . I tried to use it for legs and bikini . And it made the condition worse , because I have very dry skin on my legs , and this lotion is basically an extremely harsh exfoliant , so it dries the skin even more , but still not enough to get the hair out ! ! So in addition to former problems with ingrown hair , I got also the irritation of the skin that was extra-dry after using this lotion.So I 'm still struggling with bumps and ingrown hair , have no idea how to fight them : ( ( (	-1
I used this after shaving and it stings like crazy . It 's too smelly for daily use . I 'm not sure if it made much of a difference in my skin . If it was milder and smelled better I would use it more often and perhaps see better results .	-1
I have ingrown hair and razor bumps on my face and i was using b & c and it was like kinda working but not that good so after I saw all these review about tend skin so I bought it and start using it and my face got worst with the razor bumps ! ! ! This is a S***ty product , waste of money , and the alcohol on the product smell so strong . The seller is very and unprofessional , rude , and nasty ! ! ! GOOD LUCK EVERYONE ; - )	-1
In all fairness , I only used this for a short time ; the smell was very unpleasant !	-1
This product works fine although not good enough to enjoy two 8oz bottles , my order processed twice because of an & # 34 ; error & # 34 ; . Now I have two bottles and a wasted $ 20 . There are NO returns because this product is & # 34 ; hazardous & # 34 ; . Totally a waste and a disappointment .	-1
I got this for my husband , who is prone to razor bumps . Did n't help one bit . Also it has strong unpleasant smell .	-1
This does not really work . It 's really pretty much just alcohol , and because of that it stings . I would put up with the stinging if it worked , it does not .	-1
Doesn ' t do it for me at all . Instead of helping , my situation has gotten worse.Thanks God , I am all clear now .	-1
I bought this due to redness and bumps on my bikini line . This is primarily alcohol and does help dry out some of the bumps , but I have found it does little to prevent new ones . It 's really done nothing to eliminate the existing bumps . I would n't purchase this again .	-1
A terrible terrible thing..smells like a nail polish , feels like it too on the skin . I put it on myself once and that was it . If you want cancer this is probably for you . They don ` t let you to return it too .	-1
I really wanted to like this . There is no way of telling if it 's working . No light to let you know the unit is operational no noise to let you know it 's on . It 's a simple dial and you turn it but nothing happens . Really ? ? ? I know with the price ... what do I expect but honestly this was a huge let down . I had such high hopes that I would at least be able to use it but you ca n't even tell if the unit is working or not . I felt nothing , no current , no tingling , nothing . Cheap , mickey mouse junk . This is going back .	-1
I followed the `` test patch '' instructions , I used the very lowest setting , and I 'm still waiting - after three weeks - for the discoloration to go away . The hairs recovered quickly , in fact most of the follicles treated never lost their hair , but the blistered skin around them has not fared so well . In addition , the pain was so bad that it made me nauseous . That 's on the lowest setting , and I have an extremely high pain tolerance . I 've had professional lasering , twice , and at most it tickles . I 'm not sure if I got a bum unit or what , but I 'm immensely un-impressed with this little beast and will be returning it if at all possible .	-1
This product is way to difficult to use and takes to much time . I only successful used it to remove two hairs ( took 20 minutes ) , which eventually grew back the next month . I would n't recommend it .	-1
When I get a facial , I am dermaplaned each time . I wanted to do it at home in between visits . When I wrote my first review , I thought they were GREAT ... .well , with subsequent uses they are not that good . Their blades are just not sharp enough .	-1
This did not work as well for me as expected . It only removed a small amount of dry skin and it was right back the next day .	-1
I looked at the reviews and thought I would try this . I was very disappointed that it just did n't work . was packed and shipped well .	-1
I 've tried this twice now . The first time I did it after a shower . And then I filed as usual . I was hoping for more dramatic results than what I normally get ... darnit , I did n't . Listen , I 'm 40-something and live in Arizona , rarely wear shoes , and live in a house that is tiled throughout . My feet are BAD . I have to pamper them weekly at a minimum so they do n't catch on the bathroom rug . No joke . So I am in need of something industrial grade . Professional grade ( as this claims to be , and frankly is the same product I 've seen at my local salon where I get to treat myself to the occasional pedicure ) is not the same as industrial/medical grade that I might need . Anyway , second attempt I tried applying it and then wrapping in plastic wrap - which definitely made it easier to walk to the sink to wash my hands after touching the stuff . Oh , and this was also after a shower . So I let it sit longer . I thought I would let it go until it started to burn or tingle ... I got tired of sitting still at about 20 minutes . Then I wiped and filed . And I got the same result as when I do this straight out of the shower AGAIN.Anyway , this may be great for people who ca n't put in the elbow grease , or have baby calluses , or have never tried shaving/filing their own calluses to begin with.I 'll give it 2 stars because , you know , I only did it on my own feet . Not yours .	-1
After ordering and reading I was afraid to use it because I was concered I would be chemically burned . I 'm sure if I had followed directions I would n't have but I 'm very cautionary on things like that of those types of products .	-1
I LEFT PRODUCT ON AND SCRUBBED AFTER 10 MINS , NO RESULTS ! WASTE OF CASH ! I would not reccomend this , buy something else .	-1
After all the glowing reviews I had great hopes for this product . I 've used it several times and ABSOLUTELY no difference . No burning , no reaction , no results . What a disappointment ! !	-1
Developed a short in it after 2 months . I would receive a shock when I plugged it in before I turned it on . Also , as another user said , as a beard trimmer , it is difficult to fully remove the hairs from the blades .	-1
The size is right - the cutting power just is n't there . After reading through what seemed like a hundred reviews , I decided to buy this to trim my dogs feet ( between the pads ) , sanitary area , and around their eyes . I am terribly disappointed - it ca n't seem to cut through my dog 's fur . I would absolutely not recommend them for a dog with coarse hair .	-1
I bought this Panasonic shaver based on the reviews on Amazon and was greatly disappointed.I tried it as a standard dry shaver and it kept missing hairs . I tried it as a wet shaver and I tried it with shaving cream but still got poor results . I ending up buying another shaver 2 weeks after buying the Panasonic because it was so bad.Now , after having it less than a year , the shaver will not charge and I have to throw it away at an electronic waste center.Do not waste you 're money on this piece of junk .	-1
I used this 3 times and then put it in the drawer as a backup . Took it out a year later and it wo n't even charge . Another pile of crap I have wasted money on . It does n't cut that well either .	-1
First let me state that the shaver 's colors are nice , blue & yellow . That 's the positive - here are the negatives . Unless you have a very large space on your bathroom outlet , you will have to find another place to charge the unit . The charger plugs directly into the outlet and the shaver must sit on top of the base in order to charge - poor design.Now on to the shaving . I tried shaving my very fine leg hairs with the fully charged shaver and hardly any hairs were shaved . I am a woman and the exact same shaver is available in a ladies ' version in mauve , a color I did n't like . I tried the shaver dry and then also wet . Neither option produced anything resembling a shave.If you are looking for a shaver to shave hair and not just pretend to do so , try another brand.Update : I called Panasonic thinking that perhaps my unit was defective . They gave me a mailing address for their authorized repair center , Turnpike Appliances . This center is just about 2 miles from my house . Drove there . They checked it out and said it works just fine but is n't meant to be used on women 's legs . Women 's hair is not the same a men 's hair . I found this a ludicrous explanation . I am stuck with this useless wet dry shaver . Do not buy this shaver . I can not understand the glowing reviews submitted by some folks -- that was why I though my unit was defective . Terrible customer service and rude man at repair center . He spoke to me as though I was a blithering idiot . Grateful I did n't waste postage on sending this to them and that they were nearby .	-1
This shaver misses a lot of hairs on each pass , so you must go over each area several times . Even then , the shave is not very close . As a comparison , my Braun travel shaver cuts closer and quicker . The problem may just be the size and shape of the foil holes . Hard to complain too much as I paid only $ 30 , but I would n't recommend it . It is adequate as a back up shaver only , perhaps for your gym bag .	-1
I did n't realize it until it today but what I received was a cheep knockoff . I 've already had a short in the cord and the rubber head does't stay on . Comparing the two they do n't look the same as the one listed in the picture either . This is the feed back link listed for the product I purchased but the sellers name is listed as Colony Gold . Buyer beware .	-1
This looks like a cheap plastic thingy you 'd get at the one dollar store . If you are having troubling removing contacts this useless crap wo n't help you either . The removal tools looks quite dangers to use , and it never gets the contacts out .	-1
Well , when this arrived it certainly motivated me to learn how to remove my lenses with my hands . Even my opthamologist and his staff had no idea this tool existed for soft lenses . If I was having issues removing my lenses with my hands , then this was simply far worse . NO WAY CAN I STICK A TWEEZER-LIKE OBJECT/DEVICE IN/ON THE SURFACE OF MY EYE . I can now remove my lenses myself with no assistance . I am also aware that the staff at the doctor 's office is determined to learn to use this . Some videos help but so far they can do only one eye and it takes a really long time . This tool was effective in enabling me to remove my lenses without it . From that perspective it does deserve 5 stars because i hate this thing .	-1
I was hopeful this product would help me insert soft contact lenses . The ends are so thin that they spread out when gripping with the tweezers and do not grip the lens . I tried putting my fingers near the tips of this insertion tool and they still did not grip the lens when squeezing . Very disappointing ! I do not recommend this product . The case and insertion tools are fine , but I do n't need those .	-1
I researched vitamins for a couple of weeks before deciding on this one . That being said , if you have difficulty swallowing huge pills take my advice and get the mini-tabs . I can swallow multiple pills at one time-including my Caltrate 600-D , but I could not get these down without all but strangling . I was suprised that they were returnable . Thank goodness ! I got my mini-tabs yesterday and they are so much smaller . Definitely worth a little extra money to get a great product ! I can swallow two of these and not bat an eye . I take two in the morning and four after lunch . I 'm so glad they make these in two sizes ! Would definitely recommend the mini-tabs !	-1
I took this one night and woke up with a hangover type headache . Product on a good day seems less useful than just mouth melt Melatonins .	-1
I bought mine at Vitamine Shoppe , but after less than 10 uses , the protein mix started to leak from the lid whenever I shook it . Maybe I received a faulty one , but still the material that the bottle is made of is not as strong as the Blender Bottle ones .	-1
I got this for free and used it for a couple years before I found something better . It works somewhat , but I always had it leave a little bit of powder ( not really enough to matter ) . The top does n't screw on as efficiently as it could ( sometimes you will miss the threads and it will screw on crookedly ) . It has two caps on the top . One is a spout to drink from , and the smaller one is to let air into the bottle so that it will create suction when you drink . The spout does n't close as easily as it could either ( you have to put some pressure on it and `` wiggle '' it just a little bit to get a secure connection ) . Additionally , I always had to put my fingers over both spouts when shaking so that they did n't open and spill my drink everywhere.For anyone who is thinking of buying this , I recommend theBlenderBottle 28-Ounce with BlenderBall , Blueinstead . It is twice as expensive but much better at actually blending your drinks . Had I not ever used that , probably would have given the Bodytech Shaker 3 or 4 stars , but it 's hard to do that once I 've experienced a product that works so much better .	-1
Agh , I do n't know how anyone could get this down ! I still feel like I 'm going to be sick just thinking about what it was like to try to drink it . I bought it for a cleanse , no thank you ! I guess I 'll stay uncleansed if this is a requirement !	-1
I like the ingredient content so I give it 2 stars . But the taste is horrible , it 's slimy and it 's too expensive . I get more for the money , the same if not better of an effect and MUCH better taste when I buy my usual stuff : Amazing Grass Green SuperFood , 60-Servings , 17-Ounce Tub ( I bought it for way cheaper than today 's listing , you have to watch prices ! ) I did n't like this Greens stuff at all and it literally gags me . I 'll stick with Amazing Grass .	-1
This product did not help me at all . I am a long time nasal polyp sufferer and had hoped this product would be able to help me with chronic sinusitis issues . I do not believe the spray is fine enough and honestly this product only seemed to irritate my sinuses . I have had much better luck with Sovereign Silver .	-1
This was my second purchase of this product and is my second review . I really liked it the first time around , but have since decided otherwise . It still burns a lot and the drain is terrible . It makes my nose run right after I use it , but does n't really do anything to keep my head clear hours later . I wo n't be reordering this time .	-1
I love nutribiotic products but this one and the allergy spray as well did not help my sinuses but to aggravate them really bad . I 'm not clear as to why this happened because I have used the GSE drops in my saline rinse with no problems . There is something in the sprays irritating the membranes and making me swell . I 'm so bummed because I 've a drawer full of nasal sprays that just do not work . It could be a sensitivity I have to whatever all nasal sprays have in common and I 'm not sure what that would be.If you have used nasal sprays with little or no problem then go ahead and use but if you have had issues with numerous other sprays then I suggest to stick to nasal irrigation or neti rinse . Sorry I had to leave negative feedback but the product was very harsh to my poor nose .	-1
I have been taking these capsules for over two weeks now and I am seeing negative results . My blood pressure reading used to be on an average of 145/83 for a very long time ( over 8 years ) , but after taking these capsules as recommended in the bottle , the average reading for the past two weeks have been 163/86 . I bought this based on all the glorious reviews on this product . It might work for others , but it certainly did not work for me . After reading all the research materials on this product , I really had high hopes.Will continue to take for 4 more weeks , If I see any improvements , I will update my review .	-1
Im sure it would have been great to get from here but I never got my order . Bought the same at the health food store and it is great stuff .	-1
I have been taking probiotics for several years now , and this brand really does n't cut it for me . I 've tried several other brands but am not getting the regularity I expect from a probiotic . I take two a day as recommended and within the two months I 've been taking them I 've become increasingly less regular . I would not recommend these . Shame , I had high hopes .	-1
I 've taken these religiously for an entire month . I am just as bloated and frequently constipated as before , only I now also have frequent bouts of ridiculously noxious gas . I 'm still uncomfortable , and now my coworkers are as well .	-1
I initially wrote a glowing review for this product but have done more research since . A good probiotic does need to survive the digestive juices , which this one does due to the coating . However it only contains TWO different strains of bacteria and a low dosage at that . Now I know I need to look for as many varying strains as possible to better match the natural gut flora and at least 8 billion per dose.This could explain why I initially began to feel better after taking these for a few months but the benefits then decreased . I was taking them to eliminate constipation which I still have n't managed to do .	-1
I was encouraged by all the rave reviews , but after using these for 2 weeks , I have noticed absolutely no difference in any of my symptoms . I appear to have gained a little weight and feel that I am retaining more water than usual . I do n't intend to finish the full month .	-1
Been taking this for a month already.It has n't helped my digestive system at all , especially diarrhea.If I could give it 0 out of 5 . I would . too bad I can't.I will eventually finish the pack , and if a miracle happened , I would gladly come back here and change the ratings.but for now . it 's 0 out of 5 for me .	-1
As I said , does n't seem to help me . Everything arrived on time and packaged well . Hope it works for you .	-1
The Pearls do not have the immediate effects people are claiming . I think these are just airsoft pellets . Very unimpressed .	-1
It does n't work for me . I ca n't see any improvement and I got seek , with nausea . I am not sure if the nausea was caused by pearls , but the nausea stopped when I stopped the product .	-1
Well , I really wanted to leave a 5 star review ! ! ! These pills are very small in size and they are very easy to swallow . Unfortunately , however , my doctor thought this product did not contain enough probiotic . Pearls contains 1 billion lactobacillus , however , my doctor wanted me to have at least 9 billion ! So , I cancelled my subscription and instead , I bought the Bevko brand of probiotics ( paid $ 30 for 120 caps , 9 billion in each capsule ) .	-1
I was looking for a good probiotic to keep candida issues controlled . After taking 2 boxes of this can tell you that this has not made any difference .	-1
I 've been taking this about 2 weeks now , hoping it would help with my IBS ( C ) , especially with the gas and bloating which can get pretty unbearable . Honestly , though I have yet to feel any relief so I 'm a bit disappointed because of the rave reviews . However , I 'm still giving it some time to work . If there 's absolutely no real relief in the next month , then I 'll just have to cancel my automatic 3-months ' renewal , and continue to get the other health benefits from regular yogurt : (	-1
I took the entire pkg of these pearls . I had high hopes . I 'm 36 , have MS , take many prescriptions and have been confined to a wheelchair/scooter for about 4 yrs . I have problems with being unable to go # 2 as my 5 yr old would say . I usually take a laxative about once a week so I can go and have been trying to find something to help . This gets great reviews so I was hoping I 'd have good results with it , too . When I started taking it I had no results so I took 2 pearls every day for a week , then tried 3 a day and so on . Nothing worked . I guess I 'm still on a mission to find something to help me ! I hope this helps you , it 's miserable to always be miserable .	-1
When I had some painful constipation recently , these Pearls did n't work at all to relieve any of the symptoms - or to keep the constipation away in the first place because , in fact , I was already taking the Pearls before this bout of constipation started . I was even taking 2 Pearls a day instead of the recommended 1 - but still no results . After I finish this box , I wo n't be ordering another one . I 'm going to use a daily stool softener ( 200 mg/day per my doctor 's advice ) to try and keep regular instead .	-1
Thhis has nothing to do with Amazon . I find the item not a satisfactory product for me . For me it was a bad choce and works against my system ( in my opinion ) .	-1
I have used two different types of this brand of probiotics and both of them did nothing for me after using them for a couple months .	-1
This product is worthless in my opinion . It did n't have any effect on myself or my wife . Wo n't buy it or any other probiotic phoney again .	-1
These not only do n't work they also made me feel a little sick . Buy Digestive Advantage instead . Any kind will do .	-1
And still pretty upset.. I 'm hardly ever normal when going to the bathroom.. Most of the time I 'm either constipated or have diarreah as soon as I eat something that upsets my stomach . I 've been constipated all week and somewhat gassy . I dont know if I should give myself more time to adjust or try something else .	-1
i only used for 2-3 days , noticed only intestinal discomfort after taking . gassy & a weird bloated feeling . I discontinued use & my system went back to normal . Note , I have taken other brands of acidiph . in the past and had the same problem . Maybe it 's just me ? ? ?	-1
I honestly do n't think there 's enough good bacteria in the pill . I bought them , took them , noticed no difference and wondered what went wrong . Then I did research and discovered that I was supposed to look for a probiotic supplement with at least 15 billion cultures per serving ( this product has 1 billion ) , and at least 10 different strains ( I think this product has 2 ) . The only nice thing about these is that they are super tiny and easy to swallow . The problem is you need to tak every pill in the box all at once to notice a difference . I will look elsewhere next time .	-1
I like Solgar vitamins as they often have formulations suitable for vegetarians ( both the `` ingredients '' and the capsules ie not gelatin ) -- but I have to say that nothing is happening for me taking chromium polynicotinate . Maybe I 'm just an odd case -- I was diagnosed as Type 2 Diabetic a month ago ( my opthamologist says I probably had it for years as my eyes are a bit screwy with diabetic retinopathy which I 'm getting fixed ) . I have been on a low calorie , low fat , lower carb diet ( i.e . I maybe have a slice or two of bread a day ) , and have taken up vigorous exercise ( an hour a day of fast walking or cycling ) for the past month ; so I had high hopes for adding this supplement to my diet . My blood sugar readings are usually 180-200 , and I see no changes in that since starting this supplement for the past week . Nor do I notice in particular any appetite suppression etc . I took one pill a day and now up to four a day and nothing ! I 'll keep taking it as I bought two bottles , and if anything exciting happens in the next month I 'll re-post/edit this post with an update ... .	-1
I bought this for my ear infection . It did n't really help at least not in a way that I can discern . I do n't know what I was expecting as I read a lot of the reviews , but it has n't really done anything different for my overall health nor has it minimized pain or anything . It is a pain to take because it burns my lips and putting it inside the ear is out of the question and on my skin it just stinks but it does nothing to dull any pain .	-1
My friend swore this would replace my allergy pill . I started with two drops , upped it to 3 drops , then 4 and finally 5 drops . Stopped talking my Claritin . It did nothing for me . I sounded like I had the worst cold in the world . I continued taking it for a few more days . Finally had to go back to Claritin .	-1
I ordered this vitamin E because it was supposed to have been a blend . The bottle that I got looks very similar , however under the 400 IU reads & # 34 ; PURE d-ALPHA TOCOPHEROL & # 34 ; . I also chose this product because one of the comments said that it does not contain Soybean Oil ... . however the PURE form that I received has the following & # 34 ; other ingredients : Gelatin , Safflower oil , Soybean Oil , Vegetable Glycerin & # 34 ; I understand that I received the wrong item and this review may not be fair to the product advertised here . I list this as a caution to other customers , please double check your bottle before you open it .	-1
The problem I have with this product is that it contains soya and canola oils . Both of which are GMO products.I also do n't like the overly strong synthetic fragrance . If marketing a 'natural product ' then at least use Non-GMO ingredients and natural fragrances rather than synthetic chemicals . Too bad Burt 's Bees sold out to Clorox . The quality and genuine naturalness of this product line has gone south since the sale of the company . As a previous loyal Burt 's Bees customer , I 'm out !	-1
Normally this stuff is great . I got this box about 30 days ago and opened it last week . It does n't have any flavor in it . I tried to return it , but so far have n't heard from the shipping company . Natures Plus is n't interested in dealing with the problem , so I have to ship back to shipper , if they will allow , for a replacement . I do n't want to name them because it is n't their fault the product sucks.I suppose I will have to use it the way it is because it is expensive to throw away . It is n't nasty , but is n't good without some flavors put into it .	-1
I can not honestly say that I have noticed any effect from these caps . I was expecting a boost of sorts , but it just seems like I 'm taking a placebo . Maybe it might work for you , but I probably wo n't but this product again .	-1
Just too thick and unyielding to use . I saw the ones the dentist made for my daughter and these are rather like the football mouth guards we used for our son many many years ago . I ca n't imagine how one would keep the gel from going all over the gums . Not using/tossing out .	-1
These trays are just ok , they 're thick which is nice but the edges rub on your gums and very hard to keep in your mouth long enough for the whitening to take effect .	-1
Find something else not worth it at all	-1
Not seeing any results . Been using it consistently for like 2 weeks . It also tastes as if it were watered down ? Like only half the bottle was Plax and the other half being added water . I do n't even taste a cinnamon flavor . But glad other people are seeing results . Will not buy again .	-1
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ... ..I thought that this was more than one bottle , more like 4 bottles like the last time I ordered it . $ 25 for ONE BOTTLE is robbery and I will be sending it back for a refund ! ! ! !	-1
i am done with 2 bottles already and i could see very little difference in the reduction of tartaras plaque hardens it turns into tartar once you remove the surrounding plaque tartar becomes loose and simply falls offyes well this is just hard core proof that it doesnt do anything but damage your gumsuse baking soda and salt water as a pre brush rinse more effective	-1
I consumed canister after canister of this stuff and it does wholly-NOTHING . Some people may be asking , `` well , if this product did nothing for you , why did you purchase it again and again ? '' Why ? Because anybody who 's been obssessed with and has read sufficient material on and about fiber knows that fiber products take time-weeks , to have their full effect . So I was patient with this , continued to consume this stuff in the recommended dosages and received no benefits in my bowel habits . I drank so much water in fact , that I constantly kept running to the bathroom so often . I tried this as an alternative to Metamucil ( which also unfortunately did n't work effectively ) for two reasons : 1 ) because this one does n't contain `` orange flavor '' and for those who suffer from acid reflux , this may provide them a better alternative and 2 ) because Metamucil also offers `` coarse '' flavor which is an equivalent to this , but Metamucil generally offers it at a much higher price . It did n't work , I was left disappointed .	-1
I purchased this product once before and found this to be a great product . I purchased this again in AUg of 2011 and in Oct/Nov found worms in this product after eating half the can . I was sick to my stomach about this and wrote about this to the store . they never got back to me until jan 2012 . They said they could do nothing about this .I sent an email to them as the asked giving them the lot number and heard nothing from them till Jan . THey are not to be trusted and i will never buy from the The Vitamin Shoppe again . Please be careful for they sidestep the issue and balm AMAZON.http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00013YYR6/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title	-1
Tasted like grass . Not for me but if you can look past the taste then it has great ingredients . They were kind enouh to accept a return too .	-1
This aloe vera product is more of a liquid than a gel . I use it on my face before applying moisturizer and it absorbs fast . I like how light it feels on my face , but it does not have the most pleasant smell .	-1
I got this for my face since I have acne prone skin . I heard Aloe Vera does wonders for the skin and it many cases it cures acne . So i got the organic one and followed the steps . but this one did n't do a single thing for my skin . It was watery and I just did n't really see the point of this . I mean , perhaps I just kept using it like I was supposed to , but I did n't feel or saw any kind of improvement at all .	-1
These pills are annoyingly huge and hard to choke down . who the heck is going to keep with a magnesium regimen if it means gagging a few times a day every day ? I dont understand how this kind of product makes it to market without someone going `` hmmm ... ..maybe choking our customers is a bad idea '' . Going to look for a capsule form .	-1
Hyland 's has been offering a free sample of their leg cramp pills . The packaging looks the same as this , but it is not . I will say that the person for whom this product was purchased for was not pleased . She said that they do not work and that her money was wasted . I have no idea what the difference in the pills that we bought off Amazon and the free sample was ... but we want to buy what was in the sample .	-1
I took these for anxiety and didnt notice a difference at all , sadly I have to say it doesnt work at all ( for me )	-1
NO REAL NOTICEABLE EFFECT WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN HERBS MAY TAKE A LONG TIME TO WORK BUT NO INSTANT EFFECT AT ALL . SAVE YOUR MONEY	-1
What restless , nightmarish `` sleep '' I had ! I have tried one other Passion Flower product , and same result . All the research I could find was pro Passion Flower , however , the same botanist that discovered Hoodia , found that Passion Flower and Valerian Root could cause bad nightmares in a small percentage of people . I 'm sure this reaction is not typical as millions of people use these herbs everyday . Further digging did list both herbs as active ingredients in the new `` herbal smoke '' or `` incense '' that have been popping up lately to give people a legal high . In fairness , any drug whether it be from big pharma or natural such as Melatonin , creates an unpleasent night of sleep for me . Exhaustion seems to be the only cure . If asked to rate the apparent level of quality this manufacturer produces the pills , I would rate 5 stars . This seems like a solid company .	-1
I bought this to try and help with anxiety issues . This did not work for me at all . I felt nothing .	-1
Either because it does n't work , or there is n't enough in a & # 34 ; non-standard extract & # 34 ; to be effective . Did n't work for me . Only effect was dryness in the mouth .	-1
Passionflower is supposed to be relaxing but I did not feel anything with this brand . I was surprised because this brand is supposed to be good and is found in many health food stores . I ended up throwing these away and going back to a different brand that I use only occasionally . Passionflower does lose effect if you take it every day so I save it for rare occasions when I really need it . I actually prefer chamomile to this .	-1
don t bay it not real passion flower very bad product did not help at all . i used passion flower befor this is tne worst	-1
I 've tried a number of different iron supplements trying to get the right one for me . I do n't have the constipation problem other people have . The green pills make me feel nauseous ( CVS brand ) . The red pills were fine ( Rugby ferrous sulfate ) , but I did n't feel like I was really absorbing what I was taking.I felt like this would be the answer . It turned from green to brown ( oxidized ) too quickly for a weekly pill container . Also when I took it , I had to go to the bathroom too frequently.It might be great for some , but I say get 90 veggie caps instead 180 if you are just going to try it .	-1
I do like Solgar brand so that 's likely not the issue . I DO have a sensitive system . Fibro , periphereal nerve damage , endometriosis , irritable bowel , depression/anxiety , allergies , etc . Much of this ( I believe ) is due to a car wreck which I barely survived.Hope this is n't TMI but I have bad periods probably due to the Endo and get a LOT of blood loss , heavy periods and blood loss . have been DX'ed as anemic before , due to this . Unfortunately most iron supplements do n't work out for me b/c they make me sick : /I had higher hopes for this b/c I feel like it 's a good brand , because it was a lower iron dose than some and because it says & # 34 ; gentle & # 34 ; however it was not gentle for me at all . I was almost doubled over with mysterious flank pains and then stomach pains every time I took one capsule . I do take a multi V which has iron , but a low dose . I also felt hot , like a niacin type flush after taking this.maybe it 's just me though and my weird sensitivities , who knows .	-1
I hoped this would help but I was disappointed . The first capsule I took gave me a migraine that lasted about four days . I skipped taking them for a while and then went back very carefully because I needed iron for anemia . So if I do take it , I can only take a tiny portion of the capsule , way below the recommended amount . And then I have to take it with lots of water , a shake , and follow it with psyllium in order to counteract the severe constipation and headache it gives me.I have decided that an alternative way to get my iron source will be through liver supplements which have a natural source of Vit B12 and heme iron which is less invasive to the digestive system . I like Solgar products but this one did n't do it for me . Glad other people are benefiting .	-1
The first sign with all multivitamins , etc . is , if your urine turns bright neon . If it does , you just lost everything you thought will be kept in your body . This one does and in my opinion a big waste of hard earned $ . Kind of heavy on the stomach as well . I 'm taking a different shake , not interested in promoting it , so I wo n't mention it . None the less , it is light years ahead of this one ... . let 's just leave it at that . Do some more extensive research on MEAL Replacements , you 'll stumble across the product I 'm currently using with no & # 34 ; neon urine & # 34 ; afterwards : - ) P.S : Even tried their pills with the same effect .	-1
I started taking these Daily Fiber pills because my diet is often out of wack , and I struggled to consume enough fiber . I was taking Fiber Laxatives because they were easier on my stomach than normal laxatives , but you can only take them safely for 1-2 weeks . I shopped around for some Fiber pills and came across these.You are supposed to start by taking 1 pill and ultimately working up to 3 pills a day . Within my first week of taking 1 pill I noticed some things : first of all , I have never had heartburn in my entire life . I thought maybe it was something I was eating , although nothing had been out of the unusual . Then I started to get the nauseous feeling . The only way I can describe it is by comparing it to the feeling of taking a multi-vitamin on an empty stomach . Just a terrible , terrible feeling.Because I did not notice any difference in my bowel movements ( I actually went longer periods NOT going , explain that to me.. ) and I had n't put two and two together that the pills were causing the problems , I upped my dosage to two a day . The problems became worse and would often keep me awake at night.It took me a while , but one certain night that I was awake due to stomach pains I decided I would quit taking the pills because it was the only thing that had changed in my diet . Within a day of not taking the pills I immediently felt better . I do not know what it was , and maybe it was just me , but my body did not at all respond well to this pills . For the record , I do have a strong stomach that can handle a lot , but not these.I am still shopping around for a daily fiber pill . Any suggestions I would greatly appreciate .	-1
I saw these recommended and hoped they 'd improve my digestion . They only make it worse ! I get heartburn with these things.I would not recommend them , but they may work for others .	-1
First of all it contains Saccharin and as most people know Saccharin causes stomach problems , not to mention it 's known to cause cancer ! Why would they use it ? It makes me think they are more concerned with their wallet ( because it 's cheap ) than the health of their customers . The taste is not so great either unless you like chalk . The alternative would be to buy a far superior product such as Udo 's Choice Enzyme and swallow it.B0010EBEQO . There are many excellent alternatives to this .	-1
I have been buying this brand of sugar-free DGL for a long time . I am extremely disappointed that they have recently changed the formula so that these tablets are now sickening sweet and leave an aftertaste similar to that of regular table sugar . To be clear , the principal ingredient , deglycyrrhizinated licorice , is the same . But they have added sorbitol , anise seed powder , and stearic acid to `` other ingredients . '' It is sorbitol , a sugar alcohol , that adds the hypersweet taste . I 'm looking for another brand and am returning this order .	-1
Each tablet has a lower potency of DGL than some other brand 's offerings . That means you have to chew up a lot more of these things to get the desired effect . I personally do n't like the taste of licorice , so I would rather not have to chew up more than I need to , so I went back to using Natural Factors DGL .	-1
Based on the HORRIBLE amount of stomach pain I was experiencing I decided to go ahead and give these a shot ... certainly they ca n't taste THAT bad , right ? WRONG ! These are probably the worst tasting thing that I have ever put in my mouth and the worst part is that once you chew them up ( you 're supposed to chew them because something about your saliva mixes with these to make it work better ) so you 've chewed these up , trying not to vomit , trying not to vomit and you 've finally gotten it all chewed up and swallowed , chug some water , chug some milk and you 've got these nasty pills still stuck in all of your teeth ! Then you 're scraping at your teeth trying as fast as you can to get the nasty stuff out of your teeth . After the first 2 pills , I swore to myself that I would rather be in a TON of pain rather than go through the terrible taste again . WRONG ! I was in so much pain again that I decided to try them again , worse than child birth kind of pain so I tried them again . I really almost puked multiple times and would NOT take these again no matter how much pain I was in.After that , I did a search again and read several positive reviews about DGL in the German Chocolate flavor . Since my experience with these was so horrible I had VERY little hope for those actually tasting good but they are actually YUMMY ! ! They taste like a macaroon or something , chocolate & coconut is what you taste , not any nasty flavor at all . I ca n't believe it is even the same thing.So SKIP buying the original flavor , it is HORRIBLE ! Buy the German Chocolate , I actually got the Ultra and you only have to take 1 pill instead of 2 .	-1
Did n't work for my heartburn , but the ACID EASE by the same company is a god send.I do n't know why some stuff work and some do n't when their targeted goal is the same i.e to heal the guts .	-1
This stuff hurts SO bad ! Before I tried , I read and saw many , many videos . I followed every step.Bottom line : IT HURTS LIKE HELL ! I do n't see why people even get this done professionally when shaving is 100 % pain-free.I am returning as soon as UPS picks up the package !	-1
Horrible barely took of any hair , stunk really bad and some of the bottles were open when I received this , I have been waxing since i was 13 I 'm 32 now and this is the worst wax ever in all my years .but I returned and the seller gave my money back with no hesitation that 's the only good this do n't buy this , the veet wax strips are better than this	-1
This was very messy , very painful , and impossible to clean up afterwards . It heated very quickly to a very thin consistency so when you use the spatula to go from the container to the bikini area it was sure to drip.I hear their other products are ok . But I wo n't be trying . For the cost it should be spectacular.I threw it in the trash .	-1
I usually get waxes done at a shop but I attempted at the suggestion of a friend to try this product . It is packaged very nicely all the products are clearly labeled , the smell is nice BUT this hurt like the dickens ! ! There is a handle on the kit I bought for when it comes out of the microwave which I founf very helpful , unfortunately timing hot/too hot time frame can depend on if this will work for you . I had to microwave it twice and just deal with the heat . It does create a little bit of a mess unless you have great aim and a great deal of patience . If you are a professional this is a great product to use , but as a novice I 'll stick to the shop .	-1
Waxing is one of the things I do weekly.This item arrived so fast , I was so happy.I had used other waxing products , to me this was the most painful one . I just wanted something faster , and it just stuck like superglue and it would not come off in one large piece.It was very messy , and not all the hair came off from my leg.I will stick with the ancient waxing of mixing lemon juice and sugar again and save my money , without using the other extra stuff.But this is my experience and it is everyone else 's decision to try it or leave it alone.If i have to get anything again with waxing , then it will be premade waxing strips .	-1
This thing cost 3 bucks at walmart . I went to get some swisspers exfoliating pads ( now those things work ) and saw this thing for 3 bucks right next to it . I thought it was just another exfoliating thing ... did n't know it was for hair removal . But decided to use it anyway as a exfoliater even though I do n't have that much hair on my face.I should 've kept my 3 bucks and saved me a rash.Dont know if I used the wrong side or not ... it never tells you which side to use . Common sense I thought the sticky/adhesive side was the side to stick the pink strip on the purple tool . It did n't look like it was gon na work ... all it was was a pink piece of paper with sticky stuff on the back . I rubbed the hell out of a spot right above my lip and then used the rest to exfoliate . And right after I wet my face and dried it with a pad it started burning like crazy and left the brightest red circle right on the spot above my lip where I rubbed it the most . The rest of my face blew up red too and now I 'm sitting here with itchy red rashy skin covered in avocado and olive oil . Have no clue what to use to get the redness down so I 'm trying anything natural.If you want a rash on your face get this.. if not leave this crap alone.The company should probably be sued for selling a piece of plain pink paper as a 'hair remover ' that gives you nothing but a big ass rash.Huge clue.. no ingredients on the box but says its natural..pssh.. natural paper	-1
I 've tried it on dry skin , on after-the-shower skin and either way , yeah , it smooths the skin but does n't do much for the hair.Hm ... There must be some magical formula to make it work ? ? Have n't found it yet.Frankly , for a piece of plastic and a few rough-out stickers , this should cost $ 2 max.I am not sure I can recommend this . No , I ca n't . If it was foolproof then yes , but it 's not .	-1
I have read many good reviews about this product but to be honest , I was disappointed . I have not reordered it since . It takes too much effort to remove the hair in my leg . But on my face , I felt it is too harsh .	-1
this is a waste of money ! it does n't pick a single hair of you face ! it irritates the skin on your face , and leave all the hair in place.. go for a waxing or buy a hair off cream or smething else , this does n't work at all .	-1
I tried this to get a smoother shave . I do n't have a heavy beard . My first attempt , I left it on for the full nine minutes . After scrubbing it off with a washcloth , I found that it had n't removed 95 % of the hair on my face . I tried again the following day with the same results . It 's useless but at least it was n't too expensive.Update : Thinking that with repeated use it might get better , I have continued to work with this product . This is what I have discovered.I do get a smoother shave than with a razor alone if I apply this product , leave it on for 10 - 12 minutes , then use a Gillette fusion razor with a new blade cartridge to remove the product just as if the product were regular shaving cream . The shave does NOT last longer , though so I still must shave daily.So what is the point ? For those special occasions , I do get a smoother shave than normal . Not sure it is worth the trouble or expense , though . I did bump my review up to 2 stars though.Since purchasing this product , I have switched to an old fashioned safety razor . Shaves are close , ingrown hairs and razor burn are a thing of the past . I 'll pass on this product in favor of an old fashioned solution .	-1
I really did not see any difference in my breathing . Nor did my wife , will not buy again . Maybe I expected to much from all the great reviews .	-1
I experienced iron overload ( excessively high ferritin levels ) after taking Cod Liver Oil ( Vitacost brand ) for several months . I have an acquaintance who experienced the exact same problem ( different brand ) , with skyrocketing ferritin levels after taking Cod Liver Oil . After discontinuing use , both of us returned to normal iron/ferritin levels within 1 month . High iron levels can lead to deadly bacterial infections . We both were hospitalized with bacterial infections ( separate occasions ) during our time on Cod Liver Oil . Looking back now it all makes sense.A case study needs to be presented regarding the danger of Cod Liver Oil on iron overload . Do NOT rely on iron serum levels to determine your total iron status . Mine were normal several times , even when my ferritin was abnormal . Doctors will only check iron serum , unless you specifically request ferritin . You MUST test ferritin levels if you are taking Cod Liver Oil . I suspect it is related to the high levels of pre-formed vitamin A found in Cod Liver Oil.Please add to this post if you have experienced something similar as I want to find more possible cases so we can raise awareness as to the potential iron overload dangers of Cod Liver Oil .	-1
This deodorant smells really good going on , and rolls on smoothly . Because of the strong smell of it , though , I did not try to put on any sort of perfume , for fear that the smells would clash . Within a few hours , the smell of deodorant turned into a rather nasty odor . Also , it seemed rather sticky and uncomfortable to me . I did not like this product , and will not buy it again . ( Review of Jason Apricot Deodorant Stick )	-1
I keep hoping that someday some company will come up with a decent nontoxic deodorant ( the HOLY GRAIL ) , but sadly this isnt it . I bought the mens thinking perhaps it would be strong enough ( Im a woman -- and not even a big sweater ! ) . Im back to my unscented mens Michum .	-1
I was hoping for a natural deodorant replacement that does n't have aluminum in it ; this one is n't it . We ended up throwing them away , as they 're really sticky and actually caused me to break out .	-1
In general , personal deodorants are an anti-perspirant , plus an odor absorber or masking agent.Jason 's zircon based deodorant/antiperspirant fails to provide anti-perspirant capabilities past an hour.Arrid XX Antiperspirant/Deodorant , Maximum Strengthlasts about 6-8 hours , but is aluminum based.Tom 's of Maine Men 's Long Lasting Deodorant , Tom 's lasts all day , 12+ hours , and is Zircon based.Tom 's seems to be better for sentitive skin as well .	-1
I really wanted to like this and it smelled great but did nothing to mask body odor . I smelled gross after a few hours of daily tasks . I ended up getting dessert essence tea tree deodorant and it works great . The accompany needs to do something to make it keep odorous down not mask it with lavender .	-1
This stuff is awful ! I used to use Secret 's clinical strength ( would use it like 2x a week , thats it ) but after I made a bunch of changes to our lifestyle I wanted to go the more natural route . I make my own deodorant ( coconut oil , arrowroot and corn starch ) and love it . I never smell , but I do sweat a lot with it , but the fact that I never smell is worth it ! The people I babysit for had a bit of a central air problem and the house heated up to 84 and we could not turn it down..somehow that melted my deodorant to a liquid ! I needed something to use for the next week while I was watching the kids so I ran to Sprouts and bought this deodorant . It really is terrible . I occasionally notice I smell ( I seriously never get BO , so that is weird that this makes me smell a little bit ) and if I wear a sweater or a long sleeved shirt my armpits pick up the color/the material and leave my pits looking filthy ! It 's disgusting and the only deoder to ever do that to me . Wont be buying it again !	-1
I tried to find an alternative to old spice HE because it stained my shirts . However , I 'd rather have stains over time than have sticky armpits and BO . I tried , but I 'm going back to degree , which does n't stain as bad and old spice but does n't suck as much as natural deodorants that do n't last and feel like dried sugar syrup under your armpits.Did n't like : - sticky and wet feeling under my arms- would not last : body odor showed up after 4 hours	-1
I really want to like this product , believe me . I 'm crunchy , what can I say ? However just because I am crunchy does n't mean I want to smell funk-a-licous ! Seriously ... I would smell better if I put on nothing at all . I do n't know what is in this , but it makes your B.O . super concentrated ! You can be sitting at home on your butt all day ... and you 'll start to smell like you 've been running a 5k in 90 degree weather . Seriously , this thing is impressive on how smelly and sticky it makes you ! It also gave me a red rash kind of thing.. no good ! Also what is the deal with corn starch in the aluminium free deodorant ? My armpits are not my mouth , and they definitely would not like to be a breeding ground for yeast , thanks ! All in all , the price is good ... try it ! Hopefully it works out for you.. cause right now I 'm stuck with 2 extra things of it , ha .	-1
I 'm open to the idea that there are various naturally occurring substances that have n't been exploited by the pharmaceutical industry and that actually have medicinal properties . Hence I tried Coldcalm . I actually used it once before , about a year ago , and I could tell if it did anything . I was in the middle of a cold , so that might not have been the best test . This time , I tried it at the onset of the cold . Well , it 's been several days , and my cold has progressed right along , no different than other colds I 've had before . So I can not honestly say that this product did anything for me . It did n't seem to cause me any unusual symptoms or side effects ( which is good ) . But as for treating or reducing what 's claimed on the box ( sneezing , runny nose , congestion , minor sore throat ) , it had no effect on me.I did look up the ingredients just for fun . Allium cepa is extracted from red onions . Allium mellifica is `` made from the entire body of the female honey bee . '' Belladonna is a commonly used extract from a plant . Eupatorium perfoliatum is the extract of the common Boneset , a wild flower . Gelsemium sempervirens is a flowering vine called Yellow Jessamine . Kali bichromicum is a homeopathic remedy also known as potassium bichromate . `` The creation of this homeopathic remedy involves diluting the original potassium bichromate with lactose , distilled water , or alcohol until it is so diluted no molecules of the original substance remain in the finished product . `` There are four or five others in this product , and there is a homeopathic rationale for each . Some may have some evidence , others have no peer-reviewed studies behind them . So at the end of the day , this product did n't seem to do anything for me . Then again , there has been some controversy in recent years because some publicized studies that showed that most over-the-counter non-homeopathic `` cold medicines '' do n't help much either . Some may reduce some symptoms temporarily , but it 's somewhat questionable how well they work ( and they also seem to be rather unhealthy ) .So until a commercially feasible anti-viral agent can be developed that can cure the common cold ( practically impossible because of mutation ) , I 'm not sure anything works . My best luck has been lots of water with dissolved high dose vitamin C and zinc . But maybe that was just the hydration ... ... .	-1
I 'm not sure whether as a supplement the quality of this particular vitamin B complex is good or not ; but the packaging is for sure SUBOPTIMAL , because at least one or two pills burst inside the bottle , and thus the other pills arrived ( and currently are ) covered in the powder of the ones that split open ... . The reason I 'm rating this with 1 start is because this is the SECOND SOLARAY product for which this happens ( the other being Choline capsules ) .	-1
I tried this brand for a liver detox and felt like some of the herbs in it were constipating , so I called the company to ask some questions because there 's a brochure inside that says you can call with questions . I had to leave a message . The person who called me back was very condesending and she seemed to not have time to answer my questions , she made me feel stupid . I did n't get great results either . I avoid this brand alltogether now .	-1
I ordered these multivitamins because I have had a very positive experience with the Nature 's Plus Chewable Iron tablets with Vitamin C. The iron tablets have a very pleasant berry flavor with a mild metallic aftertaste , similar to a kid 's vitamin with iron . I had high hopes for these , given all of the positive reviews and my experience with the company 's other chewable vitamin.I received it via Prime shipping . I gave the product two stars for value - a serving size is only one tablet , so 180 tablets is enough for a 6-month supply , which comes out to be about $ 0.20 a dose/day . The packaging for the tablets is also good . The bottle is dark , so the vitamins do n't break down and lose efficacy due to light exposure , and there is plenty of cotton padding at the top to prevent the tablets from breaking.When I opened the bottle , there was a faint but pleasant pineapple smell with a little bit of the expected `` vitamin-y '' smell with it . The texture is the same as the iron tablets - a little chalky but easily broken down during mastication . The very initial pineapple flavor was off to me , though , and as I chewed the vitamin it changed into a most disgusting , gag-inducing taste . I washed it down with some water , which still did n't get the nasty taste out of my mouth , and I ended up ganking a piece of my kid 's Halloween candy to cover it up . Later ( perhaps TMI ) , I had the bright highlighter-yellow pee that comes from the excess of B vitamins being excreted ... but I was peeing out the excess for the next 24-hours , and it gave my pee a weird sweet smell . Not good.I know to expect vitamins to taste like vitamins . I have had a lot of different brands ranging from easily dissolved to chewable tablets to gummies to pills . Many have strong tastes , sometimes unpleasant . These are among the worst I have tried . I 'm not sure how or why the same company can make one flavor of a METAL supplement taste so good and a general multivitamin that is so nasty.Save you money and get something else . Mine are currently boxed up to be picked up for a return .	-1
I was disappointed that this had no effect on me . Then I read that you should take specific acidophilus for your particular ailment . This obviously was the wrong one for me .	-1
The new E Plus High C scent is a definite step down from the previous one I used for years and had gotten from Amazon and the local health food store . I gave it one more shot because the ad for it showed a blue cap and described it differently -- but what I received is the same old ( new ) one with the dark green cap and the unappealing scent . I 'm thinking of switching to Weleda Sage -- more pricey but seems to work well , and it smells better .	-1
I was looking for an alternative to toxic deodorants , and decided to try Aubrey Organics -E Plus High C Roll On , per the suggestion of a sales clerk at a local natural supplement store . Made with ( potentially ) great ingredients like aloe leaf juice , grapefruit extract , lavender , and calamine and rose water , it sounded safe enough . What I did n't realize was how messy this would be , that it would smell awful and completely burn my skin ( after shaving ) . It does work against bad BO ( Body Odor ) , but , that is about all . I really wish I could give this a higher rating . It is just challenging to to find an effective deodorant made without aluminum , triclosan or other harsh ingredients.The search continues ... .	-1
Too bad this product did not work at all . I returned it and they refunded my money right away so the effort was worthwhile overall . Had to find out what works and what does n't .	-1
The bottle says Pure MSM in big letters , but below this is says `` 99 % pure No Heavy Metals ! in red . I thought I was buying pure MSM . This brand does not pass the sink test . When I put the powder from the capsule in warm water , it dissolves slowly , but the water is cloudy . I have only been using it for three days , so I do n't know if it will help with joint pain or not . Why does n't TriMedica put in big letters , 99 % pure . 99 % is not 100 . Hope I did n't waste my money . Make sure if you are going to buy MSM make sure you read the whole label . When I typed in 100 % pure MSM , this TriMedica MSM came up . I was told pure MSM is what I need , not 99 % . TriMedica did n't lie , it says on the bottle 99 % pure ; they just put that in smaller letters .	-1
It 's now known as Natural Balance instead of TriMedica and I bought it in the 500 mg. size . It also comes in powder and 1,000 mg capsules.After taking this product I have experienced slurred speech , an arrhythmia that sounds as if someone is constantly hammering while I 'm trying to sleep , widened blue blood vessels , discoloration in the ankles , very pink lips , more exhaustion than normal , and problems concentrating . Mind you , I 've taken other brands of MSM in the past and I credit it with helping me regain the cartilage in my feet years ago , when I was walking bone on bone and feeling as if I were stepping on shards of glass . Over the years , I have n't paid much attention to the brand names , but if memory serves me well , one of the initial brands was Puritan Pride . However , I 've had the negative symptoms before and never made the connection until this past weekend . When I first started taking MSM over two decades ago , the recommended dose was approximately 16,000 mg/day , considerably higher than what TriMedica recommends . Recently , I had n't taken any MSM in months , but since the hands are getting worse , I reintroduced the TriMedica recommended dose and started to re-experience the slurred speech . Still not making the connection , I increased the dose a few days ago and it was definitely the wrong thing to do . That brought back the heart thumping and my hands would fold into fists as I slept . Four days later , I 'm still sounding like the Kripke character from the `` Big Bang Theory . '' Luckily the heart is n't racing as badly and will hopefully return to normal , but I 'm still tired and sort of restless . No one has to tell me that I made an idiotic decision ; I 'm the first to admit it and wholeheartedly regret the stupidity.MSM stands for methylsulfonylmethane . I 'm not a chemist , but I recommend that you research methyl , sulfonyl , and methane on line to get a better idea of what MSM is.Two days ago ( 01.07.14 ) PBS aired the American Experience documentary based on Blum 's book `` The Poisoner 's Handbook . '' For me , it could n't have aired at a better time as they mentioned over the counter medications that people thought were safe in the 1920s . Among them was a product of salts sold to calm the stomach and bismuth ( of Pepto Bismol fame ) was one of the ingredients . Unfortunately , the bismuth was laced with arsenic and an elderly woman died after ingesting it over a period of time . A substantial amount of the program concentrated on the hundreds of consumers that died from methanol poisoning during the days of Prohibition . At the time , people were distilling the liquor from wood ( including their furniture ) , hence producing wood alcohol , aka methanol . Methanol is methyl alcohol ! And , the manufacturers of TriMedica MSM boast that their MSM is made from pine , which is wood ! Unrelated to the PBS program but similarly , Lysol was once recommended as a feminine hygiene product . In time , we eventually learn the truth of things that were once considered benign , e.g . lead , asbestos , and formaldehyde.Bottom line , no matter how desperate you are to seek relief and how disappointed you might be with your doctors ( as I have been ) , please seek their advice first before you try such strange over the counter solutions . Sometimes the benefits do not outweigh the risks.UPDATE : Consider this statement ( found at the very end of an article from drugs.com ) : '' Adverse ReactionsWhen orally administered MSM was given to rats at 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended dose in humans , no adverse events or mortality were observed after 90 days . 18 In one study , similar rates of adverse effects were seen in the MSM and placebo group . 8 Possible adverse events included bloating , constipation , decline in concentration , fatigue , headache , indigestion , and insomnia . `` The complete article is at : [ ... ] I 'm taking the Knox gelatin twice daily , which I 've also taken in the past and had discontinued . In less than a week , I 've noticed that the skin on my feet is n't as dry as it was . Gelatin is supposed to be good for cartilage growth , nails , hair , and skin and it 's probably wiser to stick to it instead of the MSM.Advice : Consult a doctor before taking this or other similar products .	-1
This product will clog your pores if your have big pores and you can get an allergic reaction to it if you have sensitive skin . This product is most likely better just for other body parts except the face . I bought this for my face and it was a big mistake .	-1
I bought two jars based on what I read about this product ... I am very disappointed , the jars I received do n't have aloe vera , retinyl palmitate ( vitamin A ) and many other main ingredients , the company took away excellent components but the ones as Cetyl alcohol and Benzyl alcohol still in there ! ! ! . I have n't use them yet , but what makes a product works wonders is the ingredients in it ... I 'd like to return them .	-1
Maybe I will try it in juice like another reviewer suggested . . .in water it is not pallatable .	-1
I do n't know if it 's this particular brand or if it 's just the product , but it did n't work for my nursing/breast milk issues . I did n't think it would work , but I was willing to give it a try .	-1
These did n't really do anything for my milk supply , which is the whole reason I purchaes them . I had heard that it worked for others but it did n't work for me and it was quite a lot of pills to swallow .	-1
I have to agree with some of the other reviews . My kids ( 3 and 6 ) , kept putting up a fight when I tried these . Finally , I did my own taste test . Now I understand . Horrible aftertaste ! Not sure why . Almost like they have gone bad .	-1
I purchased this product on Oct , 2012.The taste is really good.The product really works great to relief my fatigue before and during menstruation . I am very very please with the taste and the potency.But even the product has an expiration date of 2015 , due to oxidation , the pills have turn to black colors . So I threw away half of the bottle.If someone needs a daily pill of [ 150 % Iron ( 27mg Iron as amino acid chelate ) + 167 % vitamin C ( 100mg ) ] it might be fine , but the person will definitely ends up having serious signs of Iron toxicity.But for person like me who only need two pills per month , it is not for me to purchase this product again , because I will end up throwing 80 % of it.If the company can make smaller size , such as 30 chewable tablets , instead of 90 . Then I would purchase it again ; otherwise , no ! ! !	-1
These are quite palatable but , unfortunately , caused gastro side effects such as cramping . I prefer the & # 34 ; gentle iron & # 34 ; product I purchased on Amazon .	-1
When I saw a chewable tablet I was very happy but it made me feel really sick afterwards . Previous iron has done the same thing which is so odd because in the past it never made me feel that way so I do n't know why now . But I took this once and threw it away . Your experience may differ .	-1
My wife bought these to help her milk supply when she was still nursing . She took it according to directions and did n't see any increase in her output . To be fair , as with all supplements , they have different effect on different people . These just did n't work for us .	-1
I am sending it back to Amazon headquarters do not take this product unless you are breastfeeding I thought it was for weight loss .	-1
I purchased this product because it was touted as being all natural . I am going through radiation for breast cancer and am not permitted to use an anti per-spirant or deodorant containing aluminum . I figured this would be a great alternative to use during the six weeks . Unfortunately , after buying two bottles , my doctor said it contains alcohol which can not be used on the radiated area . I realize I should have been more careful in reading the ingredients , but was still very disappointed . Is the alcohol really necessary ?	-1
Too bad . I liked the list of ingredients but the `` nose '' did n't deliver , I just do n't like the smell . Also , as far as effectiveness goes , I 'm much happier with the Weleda deodorant sprays ... .those are divine !	-1
I noticed nothing when taking this . Maybe the other lithium versions might be helpful like lithium citrate or chloride .	-1
I tried taking this and did n't see any results for my chronic yeast infection after a couple of weeks . However it did give me headaches , might be the tea tree oil . You also have to take 6 a day and they are huge pill and smell like tea tree oil .	-1
wast of time..tast badd.. mean reaallly bad ..the worst tasting protein you can experience with ... if not i guess i from outer space	-1
I wish I could say this will be a fantastic review like so many others but I am not going to be anything but honest . My Dr instructed me to try a B Complex vitamin to help with my low energy levels due to Fibromyalgia . I picked this one in hopes that it being chewable would be easy as honestly I am rather sick of swallowing large pills.While I think Solaray is a good company I am very disappointed in the flavor of this supplement . It says it is Strawberry-Kiwi and while I love both of those fruits I really dislike the taste of this round chewable . It is about the size of a quarter , pale pink , and not tasty at all . Taking this is torture and I honestly do not think I will be able to finish the bottle.I think I am going to see if they have another flavor !	-1
please stop saying fuel suggesting it will go somewhere .no change in libido or appetite nor energy level.just sweat and jitters , also dangerous change in blood pressure which you warn of .	-1
This Olba inhaler did not help my sinuses as well as the Vicks inhaler and I did n't like the smell of the peppermint in it . It smelled like sweet stale peppermint candy canes instead of a nice fresh peppermint . I like the peppermint in the Neti Stik better .	-1
Lots of positive reviews for this product , so I 'm glad it helped those people . For me , however , it was totally useless and did n't even put a dent in my sinus congestion . I used the product multiple times .	-1
I have developed many serious health issues after taking too much iron over a period of time especially this one . Liquid iron is more potent because the body does not have to break it down first like iron pills . Please be very careful if you are going to take iron and only do so with very strict doctor monitoring . This is very easy to take too much of because it tastes like a juice and it is liquid form and the B vitamins make you feel good . It is easy to forget how much iron it actually contains , just because it says herbs it is still a serious iron supplement , not just an herbal drink . It would be wiser to get your iron from your food , especially if you are pregnant or nursing . I took too much of this by accident over a weeks time and did n't even realize how much iron I was actually taking . I was also breastfeeding at the time and it has affected my kids . This is very very potent iron , be very very careful.Thank you	-1
Not sure what it is doing ... not much I 'd say . Try another brand . Also , BOO Amazon and manufacturer : I wrote to you both and said bottle open when arrived - had a few drops only to use . Did eiother of you replace ? ? ? ? ? ? ? NOPE .	-1
I got this stuff after other scuba divers recommended getting some ear drops that helped water in your ear evaporate after a dive to prevent stuffiness and infections . This stuff *caused* stuffiness and gave me some dangerous reverse blockages as I was coming up from depth . Do n't use it if you 're scuba-diving - use the alcohol-based stuff , not anything with oils in it . It may be fine for other applications , but I do n't need it for any other applications .	-1
not enough pill power -- for real . This does nodding , , , nothing .. solgar did a lot of cheating on the old family receipythe ingredients are underpowered need to be beefed up , ,more of , in short , , , perfectly legal , , , yes , not a performancevitamin , a waste of money ! ! ~Solgar needs to live up the their reputation please ! !	-1
These used to work wonderfully for me when I was in my 20s . For some reason , they no longer do . I just wonder if the formula has changed , mainly because they do n't even relax me anymore . I used to use them to fall asleep .	-1
Tastes bad , did n't work , and upset my stomach . Fail . I wish I could return it . Heels Calming is a little better , I will be ordering that instead .	-1
there are better tasting brands out there . I wo n't get this again.I use Aloe Life Cherry Berry and it tastes great !	-1
First let me say I 'm a big fan of Jarrow products until I hit this one . I 've certainly given them a shot . I 've gone through maybe 10 boxes of the darned things working on some digestive problems . Well I would still be using them but I on a whim bought some live cultured raw sauerkraut . I liked it so went through a second jar and bingo things started and have continued to improve with my digestion . I can even see it in my stool size and consistency . So I can only agree with the other reviews who think this product does n't do squat .	-1
Instead of being sent by UPS which would have been on my porch in the shade , it was sent by the USPS system . My neighborhood has the steel boxes for many residents and it was in a hot steel box for the day until I could fetch my mail in the evening . I opened the container and instead for a fine powder it had clots probably due to the heat . I have used this before but I returned it without consumption . USPS is not the way to go pertaining sending this to the consumer . It was in the high 90 's degree wise when this was stored .	-1
I 'm hypoglycemic , and I 've learned through experience that there are certain herbs and herbal products that can profoundly affect my blood sugar.There is little clinical study of many herbs , and reliable reporting on side effects ( or even beneficial effects ) is anecdotal . Herb popularity tends to run in fads -- there 's always a hot new herb everyone is enthused about . And the excitement over the new one lasts about as long as it did with the last one.Still , because of the buzz , anything with herbs is considered by most people to be better than anything without herbs . Manufacturers get around the `` what 's hot '' thing by throwing in the kitchen sink -- every herb that sounds good goes in the pot.Unfortunately that just increases the chances that some people are not going to be able to use the product . Or will use it and have reactions or side effects ( or even long term effects ) they do n't realize are coming from an herb or herbs in the product.Green Vibrance happens to be one of those products with a kitchen sink full of herbs in addition to the green foods like spirulina and other beneficial ingredients.I did n't realize this when I took a serving . I had been looking forward to trying Green Vibrance because I had heard so much about it and read so many glowing reviews . A few hours later my blood sugar was way low -- I had the familiar and unmistakable symptoms . I was on schedule with my meals . The only thing I had done differently was try the Green Vibrance.I read the Green Vibrance label carefully and , among the many , many ingredients , discovered the likely culprit -- silymarin ( milk thistle extract ) . I 've had a similar experience with milk thistle before , as well as goldenseal . Do a Google search and you 'll see silymarin has been noted as causing blood sugar drops.I really wish companies and corporations would get past the obsession with adding faddish herbs to every manufactured good out there . If we want herbs , we can easily buy them separately . Or the company could package and sell them as a separate adjunct to the product.For those who do n't have blood sugar problems , Green Vibrance may be as wonderful as many people claim , but I 'll just look for a green drink without all the added herb stuff .	-1
I finished the 60 day supply and did n't really notice any great benefits from it . It tastes awful unless you mix it with Apple Juice and water . Typically it would make me have to go to the bathroom pretty shortly after . Other than that , it was pretty expensive and I did n't feel much impact which was disappointing after reading all of the great reviews . I tend to eat pretty healthy though so maybe it works for those who do n't like their veggies ? ?	-1
I 'm in my fifties and am pretty average with few exceptions . One exception , though , is that I tend to experience the side-effects of medications rather severely . Therefore , I seldom take medications of any kind so I am sure there were none in my system to counter act with this product in a negative way . Nevertheless , after a couple of weeks , my navel itched non-stop . I checked myself : same soap , same bubble bath , same laundry detergents , etc . The only new thing in my life was this product . I stopped taking it and the navel stopped itching in less than 48 hours . Several months have passed with no more itching . It could just be me so that 's why I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 . However , I thought I should mention my reaction in case someone else gets the same problem .	-1
Updated post : I tried this product because an employee at Whole Foods ranted and raved about how wonderful it was . On top of that the reviewers here did so as well . I was expecting something good , but found NOTHING . I did not experience an increase in energy , my digestive system was the same , my overall sense of well being was not improved , and I did not notice any reaction whatsoever . I have always taken herbs and can tell when something is going on . There was NOTHING going on . I 've since moved on to my Nature 's Secret products , and immediately after only 1 day of use , I can feel them working . Now that 's what I 'm talking about . Give me something I can feel ! Original Post : I GAVE THIS ONE STAR BECAUSE OF ALL THE RAVE REVIEWS THAT MADE IT SEEM LIKE IT WAS SO AMAZING . I HAVE BEEN USING IT AND HAVE NOT NOTICED ANY DIFFERENCES IN THE WAY I FEEL . I KNOW OFTEN TIMES WITH VITAMINS AND THE LIKE YOU WO N'T NOTICE ANY DIFFERENCE , BUT EVERYONE WAS RAVING ABOUT HOW THEIR ENERGY AND DIGESTIVE SYSTEMS SHOWED MARKED IMPROVEMENT AFTER USING THIS . I FELT EXACTLY THE SAME .	-1
Okay , I am not sure on this ... .I have drank this , and please do so with juice , cause it does not taste good in plain water ... .I have noticed no change in the way I feel or look ... .one thing I do know is that things definitely come out green .	-1
Tastes TERRIBLE . While it has a wonderful nutrient profile and makes a nice way to pick up things that those of us who hate most veggies are missing in our diets ... it tastes like ground up month old gym socks that have been steeped in soured milk.Seriously , it 's absolutely horrid !	-1
I have been using Poliquin Primal Greens for the last few months , and I asked a friend for a less expensive alternative . On hisrecommendation , I tried green vibrance . There are tons of great reviews . I do n't get it . The taste was awful . My wife , son and Iall tried this and there was no comparison . So I am returning it . I dont know if this was a bad batch ( thought I doubt it ) , but I cannotunderstand how anyone could stomach this product , despite the health benefits .	-1
I have been using this product every day for a week now and I feel NO different than I did before taking this product . It does not give me an energy boost ( in fact , I think it might be making me more tired than usual ) , my digestive system does n't seem any different , my skin and hair are the same - there has been NO benefit at all from taking this product . I 'm really angry I spent $ 33 dollars on something that does n't even do anything to make me feel better . If I do n't feel or see any difference in my body from taking it , what 's the point in spending so much money on this ? This stuff is definitely overhyped and I 'm not sure I believe all the glowing reviews on here . I would say do n't waste your money and try something else .	-1
It might be good to my body , but I ca n't force myself to drink it , it 's horrible ... I have tried all the recommended serving and mixing suggestions found on the 'reviews ' pages but ... .	-1
I have almost constant heartburn that started about six weeks ago after I took antibiotics for a bacterial infection caused by a cat bite . I have been using these tablets before breakfast and dinner , and again before I go to bed . The taste is OK , chocolate with a hint of coconut , but they do n't seen to be helping me . I am really disappointed because this heartburn is making my life miserable , and I had high hopes for this product .	-1
I switched to the true dgl powder . I am too health conscious to take this product . Way too many additives . The sweeteners in this product serve no useful purpose .	-1
Sorry , I did n't notice any improvement from this product and I used it as directed . I tried it while seeing if it was effective when I did cognitive therapy exercises the the mind ... ... nothing ... If you think this sort of thing works..then it might be worth a shot ? My opinions that I wasted my money .	-1
Took the whole bottle ( not at once LOL ) and could n't tell any difference . I wo n't re-order and will continue looking for something better.Several years ago I took some kind of Andrew Lessman memory pills . They worked , but were expensive , the dosage was 5 or 6 pills , and they smelled and tasted bad . I may end up going back to them .	-1
I took this product as recommended for over a month with no noticeable effects . Perhaps it has helped others , but not me .	-1
The taste was unpleasant despite what others describe . Everyone said this brand tastes the best . Well , I 've only tried this brand , and the taste is hard to describe . Basically , it was terribly unpleasant . I was hoping this would increase my breast milk supply . It did not . I tried it in juice , in cottage cheese , in yogurt , and mixed with peanut butter . I will say that in lactation cookies , the taste is well hidden .	-1
This brand was specifically recommended to me by my dr , as it 's natural and ( she said ) it would not produce constipation . I need iron , and that seems to be a problem for me if I take any iron supplements . And despite paying a much higher price for this product on that assertion ... I 'm really disappointed . Caused constipation within a week .	-1
IT DID NOT WORK FOR MEDID NOT CARE FOR IT AT ALLTHAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY	-1
I purchased this after reading so many excellent reviews . I have long known of ginger 's abilities to decrease nausea and aid digestion , so I thought I would give this a try.I took one capsule the day after receiving this when I had a bit of nausea . I ended up with horrible burning reflux throughout my esophagus and to the back of my throat . The best way to describe it is similar to the burning of a severe mint without the mint flavor , but all of the heat and pain . Needless to say , I was in extreme discomfort.So , this was a big disappoint for me . At least the price is super reasonable . I feel it was worth trying as everyone may have a different experience . I do have lupus , and GERD , and other chronic ailments . I was hopeful that this could be used as a natural replacement for a prescription medication for nausea and general digestive health.Others may have a better outcome . Certainly , many have written about them . I wanted to share one experience that was not great , but may be isolated .	-1
I read it was a great addition to a weight loss but from all the time I took it as prescribe there was no change at all . Waste of money ! ! !	-1
Did n't do anything ! ! Probiotics and plenty of water helps digestion . These did nothing . I would not totally recommend , but ty anyway .	-1
I was hoping for better results from this product . I do n't feel like it makes my hair stronger nor does it help with thinning hair . I feel like I have to use a lot more of this conditioner just to get a comb through . I will not buy this again .	-1
Ended up using this more like a shaving lotion . It was too runny to be moisturizing to my hair , I could n't work it through at all .	-1
Tried opening the capsule and taking only 60mg but tastes horrible . Should 've read the recommended dosage before ordering but was in a & # 34 ; desperate to lose weight moment & # 34 ; .	-1
With only 1 % Foreskin this product does not contain enough of the essential ingredient to make a difference . Research this carefully before you buy . I was fooled by the name .	-1
I 'm not sure what I was expecting -- probably something which really built more on the boswellia herb rather than the menthol ingredient of similar `` A-bomb '' type products .	-1
I love the taste of these bars , it 's fantastic . However , when eating them I noticed that I was craving sugar much more than usual . I stopped eating them and my sugar cravings dissapeared . I assume that whatever artificial chemicals exist in this are the culprit for these cravings . It 's sad that such a delicious treat has such negative side effects .	-1
I got this and raspberry leave to help with fertility and was not impressed with either of these products . I wanted to do things naturally rather than with prescription meds .	-1
I did n't find this item on Amazon , I bought mine at a local health food store & then I saw it advertised here . I 'd never used a lecithin supplement b4 , so I took what they told me they had in the store - which happened to be the Fearn 's brand . 1 ) Taken alone , this stuff tastes about 1 step away from glue , 2 ) it sticks like glue , to anything it touches , including teeth , 3 ) I address the taste/viscosity issues by spraying a tbsp w/Canola cooking spray , holding my nose , swallowing quickly and hoping I do n't alert my gag reflex . The points raised by other reviewers about quality could be a concern , especially as the distributor was apparently not very forthcoming when queried . The label on the Fearn bottle does n't suggest it , but : soybeans are very often the source for lecithin production nowadays . And the U.S. grows tons of soybeans . That said , China imports large quantities of U. S. beans & exports tons of soy oil . Given the spotty QC history in the manufacturing sector of the People 's Republic ( as well as some other non-U.S. countries ) , one would do well to avoid assumptions re : food content . Summing up : since I do n't need to cook with lecithin , I plan to buy granules in the future - hopefully , granules that are produced 100 % in the U.S .	-1
OK boys and girls , ladies and gents , here it goes : Ingredient : Liquid Soya Lecithin1Tbsp=15.5g / 32 servings ( for a 16oz bottle ) Calories per serv : 120 , from Fat : 95Total fat : 11g =17 % Saturated : 2g = 10 % Trans : 0MonoUnsat : 2gPolyUnsat : 7g1Tbsp : 250mg inositol , 450mg cholineDo not refrigerate1 . Great brown-glass bottle , cool font lettering with impression that it was 'home-made ' , 16oz or 1pt.2 . Very thick , yellow , when put on a spoon and eaten the spoon becomes so 'fat ' that it takes a 'hard ' scrubbing to wash the very sticky grease off it.3 . The liquid is so viscous and 'fatty ' it has a hard time breaking down or dissolving in your mouth ! Do n't even try to mix it in a glass of water or mixer , it will cover its walls worse than clay of a river bank.4 . I wanted to find out if it was a US product or Chinese made , looked at the address and it said : Mequon , WI , 53092 , USA . Just above the address , really not so conspicuous it says : distributed by : Fearn Natural Foods , and the address in WI , USA.5 . Get it ? DISTRIBUTED BY ! I wanted to find out who MAKES the product and how , from what , the process they use , etc . If I eat a product , I want to know all about it . Since anything I put in my body essentially becomes part of me : brain , heart , all little cells , RBCs , immune system etc . Lecithin is good for you but you have to know what kind is good and what kind is bad for your body : soy or yolk , natural or organic , chemically derived with residues or not , is the company honest and knowledgeable , are they truthful and giving you all facts and treat you good as a customer ? Company 's attitude reflects their products ! 6 . I called the company , got a lady on the phone -'Jeane ' was her name . I asked her 'how YOU guys make it ? ' , She told me a general process of soy bean and mentioned that soy oil is being added , when I asked her how much soy oil 'YOU ' put in there , she said `` I do n't know , enough to make it pourable '' . Next I asked : `` Where do you have the facility to make it ? '' I hear : `` Ahhh , we 're in Mequon , Wisconsin '' . I say : `` I know , I am from WI as well , but where is your facility located when you make lecithin , in WI or somewhere else ? '' She : `` It 's somewhere else , I do n't exactly know where it is ! '' Then I said : `` Are you the maker or the distributor of the product '' and she said : `` We package it '' . `` Where does the real product come from ? '' I asked , `` That 's what you need to find out from the person who does the purchasing '' she replied . `` And you know nothing about the product ? '' I said , `` That 's right , I gave you all information I knew ! '' she replied.In my opinion : It 's a small company , not a huge corporation , and I think the customer service should know where the product is from ! 7 . She transferred me to a person who does all the purchasing as he was not in . I got his voice mail and asked him to call me back as I had important questions I needed to ask him about the product since `` Jean ' was the one who referred me to him and was not able to help me with questions . I waited a week ! He NEVER called me back ! I then emailed the company and after another week ( 7 days minimum ! ) someone without a name or identifying who they are in the email , basically said that the information about their product is proprietary and they can not reveal the name of the company that is the source of liquid lecithin ! I then emailed back and asked them to please identify themselves as I wanted to know whom I was speaking with , and I was a concerned consumer of their product , and I wanted to know why there was a secrecy about where their product comes from , and why they had to put an umbrella term such as `` proprietary information '' thus limiting all communication and questions and misusing the word itself ! I NEVER heard from them anymore.Proprietary ? `` You have got to be kidding me with this word ! `` -I say to myself ! I get the point : The company has no integrity , the manager is not concerned about the consumers , and hiding information is in their interest or else the product wo n't sell . I believe if the company hides something then the consumers wo n't like it . Chinese product ? chemically extracted with residues ? -possibly , I would n't risk it ! I had to deal with the company and tried their product , and both are bad ! Trust me , I call most companies and I talk to them and about their products when I use them . I make opinions based on my online research about how the ingredients are made and extracted , what 's added and how much , analysis of purity for chemical and metallic inorganic compounds , can they provide that to me , how far will they go to ensure the safety of the product , do they test for pesticide / chemical residues or it 's not mandatory and they do not ? The gist : do n't buy the product ! I had granules from 'NOW ' and they were great ! Since then I searched for even better and tried this to my horror . RUN !	-1
This product has a cooling effect and smells nice but does not relieve any type of migraine symptoms that I have .	-1
This burned my eyes and made me feel ill from the smell . It is So tiny , what a rip off.this is the cheapest lavender i ever smelledi do n't like wasting money , , , ,and so do n't buy it , , , ,it 's NO Head On.so , to make my point i 'm returning it ... it 's just a bunch of smelly oils , , , ICK !	-1
I got this for a friend who gets lots of headaches from stress . Another friend recommended it so I went ahead and ordered it ( kind of expensive , considering the size and simple ingredients ) . It did absolutely nothing for him . Yes , I was disappointed , but that 's life .	-1
I have ordered many essential oils on line and AuraCacia is a great brand - I think the problem is with who shipped it . I received this product with the top taped on - which was my first clue something was wrong . I have never had a leak problem with a bottle of essential oil so it seemed odd to me . When I went to open it - the smell made me sick to my stomach . There is a faint odor of peppermint and a large odor of rottenness.Again- I do n't think it is the brand or even the typical smell of this oil . I am guessing it is old and rotten . It is not able to be returned - so I am just putting this out as a warning.Update- Amazon contacted me and although not returnable - they have opted to refund me for this and allow a reorder at same price with free one-day shipping .	-1
I have n't been seen any improvement in the candida symptoms I was taking the garlic for ; but , in all fairness I have n't been taking full doses . I would take more , but the tablets are really hard for me to swallow . Their shape is a bit awkward and they get caught in my throat . I wish I had gone with a different product , preferably something in capsule form .	-1
I bought this a while back and recently started taking it again.. OMG.. Just read a review on B-12 ... Happened to mention the ingredients and what to look for and what to avoid..I guess I should have noticed the word cyan ( close to cyanide ! ) might be a indicator of what it contains..SeeCyanocobalamin is a cheap , synthetic chemical made in a laboratory . It 's virtually impossible for you to find this form in nature . Low-end vitamin manufacturers use it because it can be bought in bulk and added to products with claims that they `` contain vitamin B-12 ! '' What they do n't tell you is that the vitamin is bound to a toxic , poisonous cyanide molecule that must then be removed from your body by your liver . Cyanocobalamin is also up to 100 times cheaper than the higher quality methylcobalamin which we 'll talk about below.As Wikipedia explains : `` A common synthetic form of the vitamin , cyanocobalamin , does not occur in nature , but is used in many pharmaceuticals and supplements , and as a food additive , because of its lower cost . In the body it is converted to the physiological forms , methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin , leaving behind the cyanide ... '' ( [ ... ] ) Heads up.. Just wanted to let folks know ... Susan	-1
I purchased this product because it was recommended for hot flashes . It did not work for me , and it upset my stomach .	-1
I did not receive what is shown in picture . Not happy - Hope to have resolution ASAP . Picture shows One a day and I received a 2 a day bottle instead of the box shown .	-1
The product has nothing on the label to help you know what is in it . But the box has some information . I found this and figured it would be helpful for people who want to know what they are getting . I tried the product and found that it has lots of extra stuff in it that is not needed for hot flashes and moodiness , etc . I used to get a great product at half the cost from Walgreens called Estroven which was Walgreens version of this product and it was the best . Unfortunately , Estroven stopped anyone from competing with their products so they can charge a lot . Here is the ingredients and I hope it helps . Note that the `` other ingredients '' are all the fillers and junk that they put in the tablets . The tablets are hard as rocks and the fillers give me a stomach ache and are hard to digest . If you have a sensitive digestion , these fillers may be hard to break down in your gut .

I have rheumatoid arthritis and after hearing all the benefits of cherry juice decided to try these as I thought they 'd be easier than drinking the juice daily . I took them for two weeks and did not feel any different after using them . I have since started taking 2 tsp of concentrated juice , and have felt better . I will continue with the juice and would recommend people skip the pills and try the juice .	-1
If you order this you will NO LONGER GET the Great Product the reviews on here are referring to.You will get : Apple Juice concentrate , Grape Juice Concentrate , Citric Acid , Elderberry Juice Concentrate , Natural Flavors , Sodium Benzoate and Potassium Sorbate.While it will make an expensive and good tasting juice if diluted . It has None of the Health Benefits of Elderberry Juice Concentrate.I Highly Recommend the trusted and more expensive brand of Gaia . I like this product which is made to higher European standerds.Gaia Herbs - Black Elderberry Syrup 5.4 oz [ Health and Beauty ] You get what you pay for , and some times you get really ripped off - Like with Natural Sources Deceptive Labeling.I complained to Amazon and so far the deceptive image on their bottles label has been removed . I recommend that if you care about deceptive selling and mislabeling you contact both AMAZON which I have notified of this huge problem , especially for those of us who use this instead of antibiotics , and that you notify the manufacturer Natural Sources - who believe this is legal an perfectly fine to mislead us with calling Apple/Grape juice `` Elderberry '' , and to do it under the same label of their previously good product so that others will think this juice blend will keep them healthy . You can reach Natural Sources at 949-361-8829.Amazon and natural Resources need to hear that we do not appreciate being deceived like this . This is an Honesty and a Health problem .	-1
We used the Natural Sources 100 % elderberry concentrate for several years , faithfully taking 1 Tbsp . each day ( per person ) . No colds , no flu . The label always said 100 % elderberry concentrate.Like a LOT of other people , the last bottle I bought now lists apple juice , grape juice and other ingredients with elderberry being way down on the list , meaning there is not much of it in the bottle . In addition to this gross dilution of the elderberry , the ingredients do not specify organic . `` Conventionally grown '' apples and grapes consistently make the government 's DIRTY DOZEN list every year for having the highest pesticide residue of any produce.From a really healthy supplement to a bottle of pesticide-laden watery junk . Absolutely no more for us ! And - no - I did not contact the Natural Sources company . There is no contact information either on the bottle or on line that I could find . If I could find a contact phone number , address or email I would definitely let them know how disgusted I am.I have been looking for another brand of pure elderberry concentrate . Alas , there does not seem to be one out there . Every other brand has undesirable additives . If anyone out there knows of a pure 100 % elderberry concentrate , please post a comment here and let us know .	-1
My husband took these for about 3 months . He noticed that he had a lot of bloating and gas after taking these . After he stopped this all went away .	-1
I took these probiotics for nearly a year discovering the enteric coating they use contains toxic phthalates -- a plasticizer which is linked to cancers , endorcine disruption , hormonal abnormalities , infertility , and obesity.If you research phthalates online , you 'll discover the risks . Nature 's Way uses this phthalate-based coating as a gimmick to say it dissolves better , but at what price ? Whatever benefits are accruing from the bacterial cultures are undone by the massive health risks from the coating.These same phthalate placticizers are banned in Europe for use in children 's toys . Why would you want to eat plastic with your pills ? Please do n't make my mistake . Avoid this product at all costs . Nature 's Way clearly does n't care about the health of their customers . There are many safer probiotics that do n't contain enteric coating -- which is n't even necessary to begin with . The small intestine and stomach wo n't destroy the bacterial cultures . The use enteric coating is just marketing hype in a toxic chemical form .	-1
These do seem to oddly work . But I just ca n't seem to get over the taste and texture issues with these cough drops . These do not taste good , and the texture is just so bizarre I ca n't wrap my taste buds around them . It 's about like taking a chunk of chalk and just sucking on it , overall it just is n't a good experience.I would highly recommend something like the & # 34 ; Halls Breezers & # 34 ; instead which I have found to be a much better experience . The breezers have a great flavor , and a mild numbing effect on the throat . The breezers are basically like sucking on a hard candy , they do n't feel like a punishment .	-1
While this product is better than nothing I wo n't be buying any more . It does very little for me ... . and a small stick of ginger root in a microwaved cup of boiling water seems much more effective .	-1
I get terrible headaches after moving the grass due to allergies . I bought this hoping it would relieve some of the symptoms . The product does NOTHING for pain . Perhaps other are different , but it was useless to me . Not recommended .	-1
This Jarrow Bone- up has a good type of Calcium in it , as from what I have read it Absorbs pretty good , Hydroxyapatite.The bottle says to take 6 caps a day , which I think is uncalled for . Although You would take 2caps three times a day , . And I think that is a pain in the neck.We can only absorb about 300mg to 500 mg calcium at a time ! We also get calcium from vegetables which is better absorbed then eating dairy , or taking calcium vitamins.The oval capsules might be considered big for some people to take ! I do not think taking 6 capsules is enough of 1000iu D3 . From what my Dr. say 's , we should be taking 5000iu of D3 a day.There are other minerals in this , but for me , I do not think enough . I do not think there is enough of everything , so this is a waste except if you want to take calcium.I do have Osteoporosis . I 'm not so sure it is the calcium we need . Magnesium might be more important ! If this type of calcium helps our bones , we would only know it unless we had a DEXA Scan.There is K2 Mk-7 in this . But K2 MK-4 is more important then Mk-7.Mk-7 is inexpensive . We need to take K2-Mk-4 which takes the calcium to our bones and not our arteries/soft tissue . I do not see Mk-4 in this , as it is expensive , and has ashort shelve life in the body.We need to take Mk4 about every 5 to 6 hours with some healthy fat for it to absorb . K2 Mk7 we do not need to take everyday , as it stays in the body for about 2 to 3 days . Depending on how much you take ! As far as taking calcium goes , I think this is a pretty good choice , although Food would be a better choice .	-1
This would be great supplement if only I did n't have to swallow 6 pills daily ! I found it outrageous especially when other calcium supplements are available in higher doses in 1 pill.here 120 capsules makes 20 day supply only so this is not a great option if you need calcium everyday in a pill form .	-1
I quit on prozac 20 mg and after a short while started this product.No effect as prozac ( it brand name kind , fluaxitine generic was not working ) would do for me in controlling depression.Anyhow even prozac ( best brand ) after 2 month my body get used to it and I need to quit a while and restart to get similar effect ... .I wish I could find omething that has permanent effect : ) )	-1
It did n't provide the result that were expected . I hope that you have better results . Good product , did n't get expected results .	-1
Does n't seem to make any difference to my boys ( ages 9 and 6 ) . It really is like they did n't take anything at all . We 've finished a whole bottle and will not be buying any more .	-1
After using it , I got bad cramps and I immediately stop using it.Although , it made my skin beautiful , I think my estrogen levelIncrease and I do n't want that .	-1
Below was my initial review . Today , I realize DIM was most likely causing some very weird , scary headaches , swollen eye ( s ) , and blurry vision . I even went to my eye doctor I was so concerned . Then , I thought it was a virus , or my sinuses . Finally , I traced back when this all started for me and realized it was almost to the day I began DIM Plus . So for whatever reason , this stuff messed with my eyes/head , and I do think it inflamed my sinuses ! So , even though headaches are listed as a possible side effect , I did n't correlate the eye popping , head splitting headaches to DIM . Now ... .how long to get this out of my system entirely ? I have been taking for one month . Seems to help with some of the symptoms I had indicating estrogen dominance . I am almost 42 and have experiencing what I believe is the beginning of perimenopause for almost two years . Anxiety , depression , tingling in fingers at times ( yes ... this is a sign of peri ) , irregular periods , fatigue , etc . I think perhaps this has been helping alleviate all of those to some degree . Will update when I reorder .	-1
I took the pills for a good 6 months and stopped a couple months ago . I never noticed a difference with anything . Maybe they just do n't work for me or maybe they are a placebo and thats not what I need .	-1
My doc found a couple of small ovarian cysts , so I went searching for a natural cure . I tried yarrow , which was wonderful for lessening PMS and easing my period . But somewhere in my googling , I read that one should first take DIM , to balance one 's estrogen ( since an excess may be causing the ovarian cysts ) . I 've been taking DIM for about 2 weeks now and have experienced uterine cramping , low back pain , fatigue , and weepiness -- sort of extreme , extended PMS , and this is a week or so after my period has ended ! Anyone else had this effect ? A firm believer in things generally getting darkest before the dawn , I want to stick this out for another week or so and see if the side effects fade .	-1
I typically have a high tolerance for supplements but for some reason this product was making me horribly dizzy to the point I was almost passing out . I did n't make the connection at first , but then remembered I had just started taking this DIM , tried going without it and sure enough not dizzy anymore . Just a warning incase someone else has this happen .	-1
I found conflicting articles how this supplement affects someone who is hypothyroid . Since a hormone panel showed me to have high estrogen/low progesterone , I decided to give it a try . At first , I felt more energetic but within a couple of weeks I began to get very weepy and depressed . Since nothing else had changed , I decided to eliminate the DIM and my mood returned to normal . I had a blood test to check my TSH ( thyroid ) levels soon after and they were way out of range . Everyone 's body responds differently to these things so I would recommend consulting a good Naturopathic doctor before and during supplementation with this product .	-1
It was n't for me . It gave me headaches & messed with my cycle but maybe I 'm not ready for this yet in my life . I think if you were having issues this probably would work . It obviously does something with your estrogen levels & that 's why I had headaches but I 'm also a migraine sufferer & need to be careful .	-1
Headache city . Bought this for my Mother and myself . After two days of taking it , we both had the worst headaches of our lives . Mom 's was just in her head , but my headache extended all the way down my SPINE . It felt like my entire spine and head were throbbing with pain . Some say it 's the extra ingredients in this one - bioperine , maybe ? Not sure , but I 'll never be able to convince my Mom to take another try without the & # 34 ; Plus & # 34 ; - whatever & # 34 ; Plus & # 34 ; consists of . Probably , sadly , our last bout with Dim . We were both taking 1 pill AM one at night .	-1
I thought this would help with , what I think , is an excess of estrogen in my body . Unfortunately , this made me so over emotional , when nearing my time of the month - I was a wreck ! Crying for no reason at all . My periods did seem easier . But not worth the extra emotions .	-1
I used this product - 2 tablets once a day - for over a month.I use thyroid medication , and apparently this interferes with the medication , because my energy levels totally tanked . I do n't have a whole lot of energy to begin with , but using this product all my energy disappeared . Also , being post-menopausal , and this changing the types of estrogens ; in the time I was taking this , my breasts began shriveling . NOT what I want ! So , I am done taking it.By the way ; within a couple weeks of stopping this , the problems above were going or gone .	-1
Title reads : DIM-Plus by Nature 's Way - 120 Capsulesnow , how many capsules do you think you 'll receive ? yes , there 's an option for 1 or 60 , but when I 'm ordering off an ad that titles itself `` 120 capsules , '' I think that reads 1 or 60 bottles.CHANGE THE TITLE ! ! !	-1
It 's not the product fault but I took it when my thyroid was too low and it increased my hair loss . Not knowing exactly how your hormones are going to turn out , I recommend that you ask your physician before to use it . May be good for most of people but do n't take any chance if your thyroid is n't working at its full potential . Thanks for Biotin though !	-1
I purchased this product to improve hormones in my body . I suffer from PCOS ( Poly-cystic Ovarian Syndrome ) . No improvement was noticed . People commented a difference in their skin , weight loss , improved energy , and short menstrual cycles . I increased my dosage to six pills a day with no improvements noticed as other people commented . Genetically everyone body is different so what works for others may not work for you .	-1
I 'm not sure if it was the high amounts of some of the vitamins or what , but I could only take this product for about a week before I realized it was the culprit of my intestinal discomfort .	-1
My dad is allergic to bees but I am not . After taking 2 tsp . with a few tablespoons of lukewarm water ( as the directions said to do ) I started to feel like I was having a mild asthma attack and was wheezing when I breathed through my mouth ( I do not have asthma but I do have seasonal allergies ) . I tried just taking 1 tsp . a few days later and did n't have the same reaction . I might try to take it again as I am taking it for fertility reasons , but the directions are so restrictive that I ca n't hide it in a smoothie or anything like that . You ca n't refrigerate it , and you ca n't put it in hot water ... so tea is out , smoothies are out , etc . You 're supposed to take it on an empty stomach twice a day but I ca n't stomach it - the smell and taste both make me wretch . I have a strong gag reflex to this stuff . All in all , I guess I wish I had gotten the capsules although I read that this is what you need for fertility purposes ( the gel form ) . Disappointed . I guess I 'll just stick to Metforin , Maca , and baby aspirin and hope that works . I have PCOS and was able to get pregnant and stay pregnant with my son after two miscarriages with Clomid , Metformin and aspirin last time . I 've already had two more miscarriages trying for # 2 since then . I am 32 and not overweight . The Metforin makes me nauseous so I was hoping to go a more natural route this time .	-1
Just an FYI - You can buy this ( 30 day supply ) from Krogers or most grocery or pharmacies for the $ 19.99.Curious why the price jack on this ?	-1
This shaving cream is so thick that it clogs up my razor and causes it to skid over my skin without actually cutting my facial hair . I have to put the razor under water for longer than usual after each stroke to break down the shaving cream and flush it from the razors.I was much happier with the Alba foam shaving products , but those are becoming harder and harder to find .	-1
Unlike other applications where you squeeze the bottle to get the solution out , this you need to squeeze the tip ( which harder to grab with adult fingers & its also easy to get the solution on your fingers which is n't good at all ( you might grab something to eat or touch your eyes ) So far ( one day ) no difference from other easier & SAFER to use brands	-1
These ear drops helped one child with ear ache pain but it did not help the other child 's ear ache pain . The drops did n't help me either when I had an ear ache . None of us had ear infections , which this is not designed for anyway .	-1
This product is ok , but spirulina packs more bang for chlorophyll content . The spirulina also gives more BM odor control than chlorella in my experience .	-1
We bought this and it caused burning so we did not continue to use . I would be careful if you have sensitive skin .	-1
I actually got MORE migraines while using this . This is the ONLY thing I did different in my daily routine and I got more migraines than I normally do while taking this . This was my last ditch attempt on using herbal remedies for my migraines before going on blood pressure medicine to try and help control the migraines I get a month.Do n't get too upset though , I am usually the exception when it comes to meds . If there is a small percentage that has issues with a medicine or supplement , I am in that small percentage .	-1

60 % alcohol ! ! ! ! do they want ppl to get drunk on it ? seriously awfull smell and teribble to take itany real company like Dragon Herbs or Jing herbs dont put any alcohol in to their herbswe want pure herbs not dilluted with water	-1
Not the most effective of this kind of product in the world and way too much alcohol ! . Least effective brand I have found !	-1
I had one from a different company ( unknown , unfortunately ) that lasted many years . I 've only had this a few weeks , and i 've already got a hole in the mesh bag . Dimensions of the bags are smaller , making this less usable.After 3 months , already has long tear in seam on side and must be tossed . Very unhappy with this product .	-1
This review is written just to disclose that the product contains alcohol 61 % -71 % .The other unlisted ingredients are hydrangea root , celery seed , and burdock seed.Since I have HCV I do n't appreciate the alcohol and feel that should have been listed.I will not buy it again and will look for a non-alcohol containing formulation .	-1
I 've used this off and on for quite a while , but do n't plan to do so in the future . Why ? I ca n't see that I feel any differently whether I take it or not . Lots of folks swear by this stuff , which is why I tried it . But for me , no .	-1
silly product and another gimmick dont waste time or money as it does not work for crap Ill be very careful about what I buy in future	-1
Well , contacted this company because I did n't receive product in a timely matter , they responded that they would ship it out as soon as they received it from the manufacturer . I thought , okay..I know this is a hot item now ... I understand . I waited and kept tracking the package after I was notified it shipped . I saw on the USPS tracking site ... incorrect address . I double checked the address that I entered , sure enough , I entered the correct address . Two bottles ( 1 oz . each ) were to be sent to my daughters address ... 1 for her and 1 for myself . I contacted this seller via e-mail once again , asking if they could correct the mistake . They responded that they would have someone contact me responsible for this , no one did . Today I received a call from my dtr . Only 1 2oz . bottle was finally delivered to her ... Not ( 2 ) 1oz . bottles that I ordered . SO ... I do n't get a bottle after all ! ! An enclosed note explained that they had to use a different manufacturer than their current one , and the 1oz . bottle is out of stock , hence the reason for sending out the 2oz . bottle . I looked up the manufacturer that they used ... the Electic Institute at Pharmaca . Currently , their 1 oz . bottle is selling for $ 7.49 , regular price $ 9.99 ... .much lower than what I paid to this company ! ! ! ! ! They do n't have a 2oz . size available on their site . Looks like Herb Pharm ( Herbs Pro ) pocketed and profited from what should 've been my savings ! ! ! ! ! And ... I did n't receive a bottle for myself ! ! Very unhappy ! ! Needless to say , I ca n't tell you if the product works . I can only inform the next person of my personal experience with the order/shipment process . I have no other experience with this company , perhaps they have a good track record the majority of the time ... this time , they dropped the ball .	-1
I bought this because it was on the Dr. Oz show . But , it turns out I couldn & # 8217 ; t continue using it as it knocks out my thyroid medication . Anyone using any thyroid medication shouldn & # 8217 ; t be using lemon balm . And , I had done some web searching on Lemon Balm before I ordered it , but it wasn & # 8217 ; t until after I got it that articles started pulling up about it & # 8217 ; s interference with thyroid meds .	-1
I purchased the Herb Pharm Lemon Balm extract mineral after seeing Dr. Oz recommend it for stress/anxiety . I have tried it over 10 times and can not tell a difference after taking it . I can tell that it tastes disgusting . It tastes like a shot of Bicardi 151 . I do n't know if the objective of the product it to calm you down buy getting you drunk or what but it definitely tastes like pure alcohol . I would not recommend this product . It would be cheaper and easier to take a shot of alcohol rather than take this product .	-1
I am disappointed because this bottle reeks of alcohol with a slight vanilla smell . I ca n't believe it contains as much of the herb as stated .	-1
The Country Life chelated magnesium tablets were purchased before learning that magnesium oxide , which is what these tablets are , is the least absorbable form of magnesium . Still , I hoped these chelated magnesium tablet6s would break down and be absorbed . To determine whether the tablets dissolved well , I placed one in vinegar and left it for 30-40 minutes , adequate time for it to dissolve , or at least show some progress . The outer 'layer ' had barely begun to break down in that time . The tablet was still solid . Since I have a bottle of 180 tablets , I 'll crush them , or cut them into smaller pieces and add to milk shakes , until they are used up . I will look for another form of magnesium that can be absorbed more efficiently next time , and in capsules .	-1
For the price this is OK , I could feel a difference within the first few days , trying another product to compare , but , I gifted others this one and no complaints .	-1
HAVE ONLY BEEN USING THIS FOR 3 DAYS , WILL GET BACK TO YOU .	-1
I had previously bought the biotic plus version of this and my mother LOVED it with all her heart . It made her hair and nails thick and long . This one made her feel sick and she could n't sleep at night . The time-release made her feel jittery and awful and she had to stop taking it.Though it helped with her hair and nails , she was n't able to stay on it to see as good as benefits as the biotic plus .	-1
They say , `` If it 's not broken , do n't ` fix ' it '' and this applies for this `` Improved '' formula . The original worked way better for me . I received tons of thickness and growth with the original , HOWEVER , if you are looking to just thicken your hair , this product will definitely accomplish that for you . Nevertheless , you can get BOTH thicker and longer hair with the original .	-1
The first time I tried these vitamins I thought they gave me some baby hairs and stronger shinier nails . This time , I do n't notice any difference at all .	-1
This is the worst , it does nothing but increase the pain you have . I do not reccomend this product for heartburn relief .	-1
I have had heartburn since I was 13 . This is a family thing . I wanted to get off the proton pump inhibitor because of the side effects . Unfortunately , Heartburn Free did not work for me , I had hoped it would . Perhaps it would work for someone who has not had heartburn for a very long time .	-1
Ok , ok ... before I get negative remarks for this low review , let me explain . The single star rating states & # 34 ; I do n't like it & # 34 ; and I do n't like the flavor AT ALL . While I realize one does n't purchase this product FOR the taste , I feel it 's worth mentioning that it induces a vomiting effect in both myself and my young son ( and HE loves mint ) . It 's just too darn strong . It tastes like pure spearmint oil to me . I would actually prefer a Green taste and just mix it in with some diluted juice . Does anyone have any recommendations ? To each their own , but beware of the potent flavor .	-1
maybe I did n't use it long enough but it did n't work for me . I will be trying the liquid form soon . Would not recommend .	-1
This did n't work for me.Makes your stomach hurt sometimes.Only good is that it contains some copper.I take it as a supplement.Will not buy again.Does NOT do what it says it is supposed to .	-1
I purchased this product thinking it was a root . The Amazon description was not very clear . After I received the product I realized it was not made from the root . The roots are potent and work quite well .	-1
I did n't notice I single thing one way or the other . I fixed my hair and skin by changing my diet . These were of no help whatsoever	-1
I find it very difficult to offer a glowing review for this product . What may work very well for one person , may not be so good for the other . I had been using it for years , however with little or no results . So , obviously I had to stop taking it and not spend the money . Thanks for reading and I hope this helps.Tony	-1
Only had for a couple months but does n't seem to do anything for teeth or hair . Does n't seem to help much with pain either .	-1
Latest medical research says that this product is not effective for its advertised use . SO , as a retired RN I chose to discard and no longer use it . My joints are in the exact same condition as while taking it . Stopping has had no adverse effects .	-1
I tried taking this with 5-htp , but I found that it was of no help at all . The only thing I noticed were random stomach aches ( some of them quite painful ) , that went away when I quit taking it . Not sure what triggered them , but between those and no detectable benefits for my body , I quit taking them . Always worth a try , though , to see if it works for you !	-1
Folks , I know adaptogens . I know how they make me feel ( wired , edgy ) . I also know St. John 's wart ( clear minded , outworldly ) . This product is a mix of the two . I mean I can order adaptogens if I want them . But the label says nothing and yet they lace their product with adaptogens anyway . This is a plague on the supplement industry . It is not just dishonest , it can be dangerous too . There are several other brands of St. John 's wart including solaray and Swanson . And I can attest to both these brands being pure with accurate labels .	-1
I purchased this because in the past , Nature 's Way brand has done the trick for me . This is not on the mark , however . I use St. John ' Wort for mild depression . I may play with the dosage to see if that will work . Better yet , I think I will purchase some from my local vitamin shop because that worked better .	-1
there are studies which confirm it may cause eye problems with connection UV light . there is a disclaimer on the package warning against UV exposure . not something to experiment with .	-1
I have been looking for something to help with some minor anxiety . Did not want to take any heavy medication , so was looking for something to take the edge off . I tried this and other products , they had no effect on me.I am posting this review so that others may know that while this works for some , it does not work for all . Each case will be different .	-1
This was n't really effective for me . I took it about a few months but did n't really notice a difference in how I felt .	-1
I took it for a while but did n't find very many benefits . I could n't really tell if it made my mood better . But I took it at a time when my Anxiety was very bad.I do n't think it was worth it for me just because of how many other medications it interacts with . I wo n't be taking St. John 's worts again .	-1
My sister said `` this is the one to buy -- -it works ! `` So I bought it - she takes several tablets at a time - I took only 2 . Several hours later I got the most horrendous stomach cramps imaginable . I actually moaned out loud and scared my dogs ! ! ! After a couple of HOURS of stomach cramps I finally got `` results '' , but it was by no means EASY.Will never take these again .	-1
Previously I always used Puritan Pride Herbal Laxative and decided to go back to that brand . It agrees with me much more .	-1
We have been taking & # 34 ; Experience & # 34 ; by Awareness and wanted to find something cheaper . This stuff was cheap , but it did n't do anything .	-1
I got these because of all of the wonderful reviews on how gentle this stuff is and the fact that I needed something to relieve mild constipation . I was in SO MUCH abdominal pain . If you use these you need to be near a bathroom when they affect you because you will be in trouble if not ! It cleans you out alright , in a very crampy painful sort of way . such a complete waste of money , I recommend avoiding them . I am a very healthy active 28 year old mom who has a very clean bill of heath .	-1
First time I tried it two did n't work second time tried five and finally worked but gave severe terrible cramping took more that 12 hours to work and only produced a small painful bowel movement	-1
First of all , I 'm 64 years old and have never used HRT ; have been using NOW Indole-3-carbinol for several months with great success in overcoming symptoms of Estrogen Dominance ( bloating , water retention , insomnia ) . Tried this Calcium D-Glucarate after reading that it aids in ridding the body of xenoestrogens and took it along with the I3C . I started out with 2 tablets per day ( 1000 mgs ) with no apparent results , then went up to 4 tablets . Symptoms returned with water weight gain , a very bloated belly and trouble staying asleep . I discontinued use and within a couple of days those problems were gone . Indole-3-carbinol and DIM enhance & # 34 ; good & # 34 ; estrogen production , while getting rid of the harmful ones . Think in my case the Calcium D-glucarate got rid of the good stuff and left me with symptoms of too little estrogen , which are a lot like estrogen dominance . I base my one-star rating solely on my experience with this product . It may work just fine for others .	-1
These taste like a corroded battery Warhead . I think I 'd rather die of liver failure than put one more of these in my mouth .	-1
I never felt anything from it . I had a million reasons why it should have been helpful for me as I have multiple health conditions that point toward glutathione deficiencies . But alas , this supplement did n't alleviate any of my symptoms . Could be a dosage issue , but who knows .	-1
THIS IS 27 % ALCHOHL ! ! ! ! ! NOWHERE WAS THIS STATED IN THE DESCRIPTION , AND I BOUGHT IT TO GIVE TO A CHILD ! IT MADE MY DOG VERY SICK . I AM CONTACTING A LAWYER .	-1
I purchased this for my cat when he suffered a traumatic leg injury and had to be taken to a specialty Vet 30 minutes away once a week or more for over a month . I also read about this product inThe Natural Cat : The Comprehensive Guide to Optimum CareHe 's a rescue and skittish to begin with ( runs when there 's a knock , hides when new people visit etc ) and I was very worried and upset at the amount of stress he was going to be under with the frequent trips to the vet , medicines , surgeries and daily care . I was hoping this would work but I saw absolutely no difference in his demeanor after administering this per the directions . I even dropped some of the liquid in his carrier in the corner he liked to huddle in and still nothing . In fact , my cat started to associate the Rescue Remedy with going in the carrier/to the vet so then it became impossible to give this to him.I also tried this on my female cat who freaks out in the car and the carrier and again , no change.I tried one last time to see if this Rescue Remedy would work by trying it out on myself and it did nothing . My job is mentally stressful so I am open to using holistic means of relieving stress and was disappointed this did n't work.I 'm glad it has worked for others but this did not work in any way , shape or form for me or my cats .	-1
I tried this for two weeks based on the recommendation of a cat rescue organization , but I have not seen any improvement in my cat 's behavior . It is tasteless , he eats whatever I put it in - and that 's the one star I can give it , because normally he eats around anything I add to his food - but unfortunately it has not calmed him down .	-1
This is loaded with alcohol and does n't do too much for me . I actually bought this on accident because I wanted to get it for my dogs and did n't know there was another version . I still use it from time to time , but a small shot of vodka would probably do the same .	-1
This product seems to have two major reviews : It either works or it does n't . It 's hard to find anything about people having adverse reactions , but they 're certainly out there . Personally I found that this caused my anxiety to worsen and made me hyper-aggressive . I think before investing in herbal remedies it 's important to evaluate your responses to previous experiences .	-1
We bought this on the recommendation of a local groomer as a way to relax our long haired cat who does n't like brushing . Our cat took it without much problem , but he started running around like crazy . He fought the brushing process with his usual `` stop pulling my hair or I 'll bite you '' demeanor . So , it did n't hardly relax or `` rescue '' anybody . I noticed before we purchased it that the main ingredient is alcohol , so I suggested to the missus that we skip buying this product and spend a few dollars more to just get a bottle of Jack Daniels . At least that way , I could have been relaxed if my cat was n't . The missus was afraid I would n't give the cat the right `` dose '' of Tennessee medicine , and she really wanted to give Bach 's a try . It just did n't work . So now we 're stuck with an expensive medicine dropper in a tiny bottle of homeopathic booze . My wife 's disappointed and frustrated . My cat 's tangled and matted . I 'm dry and sober . Sigh .	-1
I saw this on the Dr. Oz show and thought it would be the nirvana for stress relief . I must admit that I do NOT think it has made any difference in my life . It might work for you but it does nothing for me .	-1
Tried this product because Dr. Oz recommended it but it did n't seem to do much for me . Only used it a couple of times but I did n't notice much difference .	-1
A friend recommended this product to me , and I ordered it without really reading a lot about it . When it arrived I read the label and realized the main ingredients are alcohol and water . Maybe this product does work for some people , or maybe it 's the placebo effect I read about , but it did nothing for me except give me booze breath.Sorry , but this is one homeopathic remedy that does n't contain enough of anything to be effective.I gave the bottle to the friend who recommended it .	-1
This is just watered down booze . Might as well save your money and take a shot of the real stuff . Plus , do n't use this on your animals without researching first ! many dogs/cats are allergic to herbs and giving an animal alcohol is never a good thing !	-1
Never did . I have nothing to say on the subject of this stuff cause i never actually used it . yup	-1
I gave this to my cats before a long car ride , and it did nothing to calm them down . They screamed anyway , and one even got out of the carrier . I would say that this stuff made them more excitable . ironically , They 've never behaved like that in the car before . Go figure .	-1
I had high hopes for this spray but so far it has not done a thing for me , it could very well be me . For someone else it could work just great you will not know until you try it .	-1
I have to re-evaluate how much credibility I give to reviewers after this one . This did absolutely nothing for me . Taste 's like a shot of booze . Gave it to my boss , in case she needs a `` shot '' during the day.Not recommended .	-1
My wife was using this product for her canine massage business to help calm new 'clients ' and a events where a calm atmosphere was not simple to maintain . The claims are that this will assist with anxiety in pets and help them deal with the stress of new situations.So - I think the main question here is 'does this work'.Over the course of two years and using this on dozens of dogs , the answer is 'I do n't think so'.I fully understand the premise - flower essences are easier on the canine nose than essential oils - that makes logical sense . The reality here is do these specific essences work ? We have seen no evidence that they do . We have researched , tested and utilized this product as directed with no noticeable result.All I can say is that in our experience over a couple of years with dozens of dogs , we do n't see it being useful at all.Hope that helps .	-1
I have a 2yr . old blind dog who sometime gets anxious when we leave him home alone , so I thought I would try this item . It has n't seemed to help him much with his anxiousness , according to the video that I 've recorded of him when we 're gone , so not sure it works .	-1
Dr Oz is the one that suggested this . I think he get 's a kick back on all the products that he talks about . I can tell no difference .	-1
Tastes like watered-down rum , as others have stated.I do n't feel much , if any , effect . I spray 4 instead of 2 , hoping to feel something , but I ca n't say for sure that it does anything .	-1
I do n't know how well this works on helping you relax and fall asleep . It does n't really do that for me . It tastes bad when placed directly in your mouth . Kind of like rubbing alcohol . Better off diluting it in water . The price is good . I have seen Bach Essences priced at up to $ 20 in health stores and spas .	-1
Sorry to say this product did absolutely nothing for ant bite I received . This time it was a carpenter ant bite on my hand . By the time I noticed it on my hand it had already bitten it . It is swollen and so itchy with a red speck in the middle where the ant bit . In the past I have tried Sting Stop for fire ant bites as well and no relief . I was hoping it would work for this different type of bite . It has been 3 days and I am so uncomfortable . I wished it had worked .	-1
I have using 90 % DMSO for years . I thought 70 % would be more gentle . This is the opposite . It has left red sunburn type burn in areas where applied . It has been days and I am waiting for them to go away . The 90 % never left redness . The seller wo n't refund unless it is unopened .	-1
This stuff tastes like honey mixed with vodka . No bad , but the only problem is that there 's hardly a sip in each bottle . Do n't waste your money on this phony elixir . Does nothing for my virility .	-1
Stick with the Tablets . I 've seen this in three versions . Liquid , Capsule , and Tablet . I had always used the tablet ( big horse pill ) , but I thought this would provide better absorption under the tongue . Bad guess , had to put about 30 drops in another liquid ( water , milk ... . ) twice a day , and it not the best tasting stuff in the world.I 'll go back to 1 tablet a day for health maintenance over doing this twice a day .	-1
I purchased this thinking it would be the perfect oil blend and I noticed after I got it that Soy is in the ingredients . Soy is literally in EVERYTHING ! Do people not know that soy is a common allergy ? I 'm sure there 's many other things that can replace soy .	-1
I use this stuff daily and keep buying it , BUT I just ca n't get past the awful taste . The blend of oils in this stuff is amazing . Just wish it tasted better . I 've tried mixing it with everything possible to disguise it and I ca n't . If anyone has any suggestions to get this down easier , please reply to this post !	-1
Bought this this to take daily and still got sick ... . Yea , I know it 's not a perfect prevention but since it 's taste is worse than competing brands I 'd rather have not taken it at all and just gotten sick ...	-1
The nutrients and health benefit is outstanding in all the regular Emergen-c but I remember from a few years ago that the super orange tasted half like real orange and half like a good artificial orange , like Tang or orange soda pop . It used to be my favorite by far but the orange flavor is now pure chemical orange and there is a strong off flavor that distracts from the main flavor . I 'm giving it 2 stars only because the lemon-lime is definitely worse.I must admit that the super orange still produces the least fizz when mixing so you can mix a larger batch without overflowing the container with foam.The only flavor I can recommend now is the pink lemonade , which tastes good with no off flavor or aftertaste , though I hesitate to call it natural tasting.update : 6 Jan 2013My mom actually still had a bunch of the old formula emergen-C flavors . The old super orange was fine - 3 stars . The new super orange is really awful - 1 star . The only difference I found in the ingredients on the packages was that the old one listed malic acid , orange juice powder , natural flavors . The new one listed natural orange flavors , malic acid , orange juice powder.The new acai berry is still good - 3 stars . The old black cherry heart health was very good - 4 stars - so I 'll try the new one and report back in that product if the new one is also good.update : 2 Mar 2013The new black cherry was unusable . Stick with the pink lemonade or acai berry .	-1
At it 's core you get 1000 mg vitamin C. But they throw in a bunch of B vitamins to get you going . Not sure that 's what I want to do if I 'm sick or if I 'm coming down with something .	-1
Like the concept , but I stumbled upon Sufficient-C and was much more impressed with how they used Stevia to create a lemonade type drink mix that my kids love ! We drink it with meals and my kids have come to ask for it without prompts from me . It is our primary beverage among the adults in the house too ! Thank you Sufficient-C .	-1
Feb 7th 2012 : The brush is wooden which is nice and the bristles are on a plastic piece . There is a slight curve to the angle of the handle and the length is just right to reach everywhere . Now , for some the bristles on this might hurt - they are a bit stiff and pointy . I like it , it feels good and exfoliates well . Lather it up with some body wash and your back will love it . Get a good scrub and clean feeling - just what I needed . Oh , and there is a nice loop on the end so I can hang it to dry.REVISED:12/30/12 - one year later with very light use if any the bristles are falling off and the plastic cracked - see my pictures posted . This brush is going in the trash -	-1
It was nice while it lasted . It material that holds the bristles cracked and the bristles started coming out rendering this useless in just two weeks . Avoid this !	-1
ilove the natural products , im tyring to incorperate more natural products into my lifestyle . being summer in florida i have to apply more than usual	-1
I really do not like this product . I wanted to find a deodorant that did n't have all of those bad for your skin ingredients but this deodorant was no good . As I applied it , it felt like a glue stick . It was very sticky and smelt sort of strong and manly and did n't leave me feeling fresh .	-1
I got this item for myself and my daughter when we were coming down with bronchitis . I never noticed anything happening , and eventually we both had to go to the doctor for antibiotics . My daughter has asthma , so I was really hopeful that this would work . I am a fan of other chinese formulas , and we are never without Gan Mao Ling in our house .	-1
I found that it did not work for me at all . and I could not see anything that it did so I will not purchase this again..	-1
I thought this was the one with natural flavors , but I was wrong . The Naturally flavored Orange and Berry are 5 Star products , and they do not upset your stomach like this one does .	-1
The product I rec 'd from this company was watery . I 've purchased this product for years and it 's *never* once been watery . Both 32 oz . bottles were equal consistency . I 'd like the ability to block this vendor from my future purchases .	-1
I had one of these chests in the past and really liked it.But eventually the snap used to close it tore and then fell off , preventing the box from closing.I was very dismayed when I received this one and the snap was already torn ! I ended up getting a storage box for nuts & bolts from the hardware store which is much sturdier and works much better than this one ever could .	-1
I do n't even know if these work because every time I start a course I develop a sore stomach within a couple of days . If you 're sensitive , this product is not for you .	-1
I did not like this product . It did n't detox me like it claims it supposed to do . Nothing in my & # 34 ; habit & # 34 ; changed . And the taste was very bland , did n't mix well . Very disappointed	-1
This product did not help my system but everyone reacts differently . It just upset my stomach and tasted pretty terrible .	-1
I was really excited to get these log cramp tablets because of all the wonderful reviews . Unfortunately , they do not help my leg cramps at all . They taste good , and I 'm really glad that so many people have found relief from them ... just wish they would have helped me . I 've found some relief from a combination of magnesium powder , magnesium soaks , and transdermal magnesium . I will continue to try these tablets until they are gone and will update this review if anything changes .	-1
I was hoping that this would be a good replacement for Legatrin ( which was taken off the market several years ago ) . It was n't . I 'm now left with drinking a small bottle of Diet tonic water to get the little bit of quinine my leg cramps and restlessness seem to need some evenings .	-1
These insoles give a lot of support across the arch , thats the good part . The bad part is there is almost no padding , which isnt really mentioned anywhere .	-1
these are nearly impossible to get on the door knob , bought for my mom who has rheumatoid arthritis and ca n't get them on the door knob not a good investment	-1
I probably should have looked a bit closer or read the reviews closer . With my MIL 's current pill box - each days worth of meds come OUT of the main container - she then keeps them in a pocket or on her walker tray . But this med planner - although large - just is n't nearly as handy . She would have to carry the whole week 's worth of meds around with her :0 ( I may save it 'just in case ' but will probably never use it . I was disappointed - AGAIN.The Apex Medi Tray is the one we have now or one very similar - but when I ordered another one on Amazon - it came in BLUE and you can not see the pills inside - impossible to tell is the pills have been taken unless you open each window . So , another one hits the dust :0 ( http : //www.amazon.com/Apex-Medi-Tray-Times-Days/dp/B000KI5QVU/ref=pd_sim_hpc_3If someone knows where I can find The Apex Medi Tray or similar in CLEAR like the one we have now - please comment here.Thanks .	-1
Bengay Cold Therapy , nice product look , right size , the scent was not over-powering . So that 's the pro 's . Con 's - The product really goes on gooey , very wet , slick . More than any other product I 've tried . It did n't help the ache in my lower back at all . Perhaps it works only on minor aches and pains . I wish I could give it more of a review but it just did n't work .	-1
I do n't like writing 1 star reviews , but in this case , at least for me , this product did nothing but stink up my bathroom until the smell `` vanished '' . So I feel the 1 star is warranted.I play racquetball and my knees take quite a beating . Normally I take Advil before I play and the soreness I feel afterword is really minimized . Every once in a while I forget the Advil and I am very sore later.When this happens I ice my knee for 20 minutes and it feels better . So when I had the opportunity to try this product via the Vine program , I did.I wanted to see if it would work for me . I skipped my Advil and played racquetball . When I got home instead of icing me knee , I tried the Bengay cold therapy.Boy did it smell , but like everything that smells , it does vanish after a while.The worst part was that I did n't feel anything . No cold , no muscle relief , nothing.I waited about 30 minutes and gave up . Went and got my ice pack and put it on.So while this may work for some people , it did nothing for me .	-1
I was pretty disappointed with this product as far as its pain-relieving abilities go . It really did n't do much for the pain . Something like icy hot is much more effective . The cooling sensation is nice , and it does not smell horrible ( it 's not great , but better than other pain-relieving creams ) , and those are the only two reasons I gave it two stars instead of one . I would not purchase this product . Icy hot or aspercream are more effective . This was nothing more than a mild cooling sensation , and it does not perform the way it is supposed to . Save yourself the trouble and buy another brand .	-1
I honestly did n't see that this product worked any better than the generic blue cold therapy product I buy at the drug store . ( Twice as much product for less than the Ben Gay . ) Of note , this product 's main ingredient is 5 % Menthol and my generic is only 2 % . This product does seem to have slightly less of a pronounced menthol smell than my generic .	-1
It may have a vanishing scent but I have no sense of smell and I can smell this stuff . Also , I expected it to be deoderant hard or at least like a roll on , it was very messy and I had to rub it all in plus it got all over my shirt and I had to wash it immediately . I will stick with other remidies .	-1
Did n't like the product . It is not a vanishing scent , the scent lingers for sure . It is greasy and after using it once , I threw it away . It was not the answer I was looking for . I thought I could use this instead of ice packs , but the cold does n't penetrate .	-1
It made me feel lightheaded , so had to stop taking it . It may have been the other products that I was taking it with .	-1
I did not notice any effect from this supplement . Maybe it is not something I am in need but I would research them a bit before purchasing .	-1
I originally purchased this item because I thought it might help with a gut issue and perhaps allergies , as my nose had started running profusely at the time . Admittedly , it did not help with the gut issue because I needed to follow a manufacturer-prescribed regimen , which I was unwilling to . Sorry , feeding my system with that much silver per day was not for me . However , my nose kept running , even after I 'd finished the bottle and now I have the first real cold I 've had in probably three years . Coincidence ? Who cares ? It 's supposed to be this immune-support hottie and , to repeat , I now have the first real cold I 've had in nearly three years . I probably would 've been better off not taking it in the first place . To all of those who think this product is the second coming of sliced bread -- woo-hoo for you . Not me .	-1
I ordered this for my 9-year-old grandson who has a lot of trouble with motion sickness . I ca n't really say yet how well it works because I just opened the package . I 'm writing now because I 'm unhappy with what I received . They wo n't let you choose a color , so I assumed they would surely send a gender-neutral color . Was I ever shocked when I opened the package to find PINK bands . My grandson is at the age where he is anti-girls and anti-pink . I wonder if I 'll even be able to get him to wear this . I 'm tempted to return it . How much trouble could it really be to allow your customers to choose a color ? ? Update : I am returning the bands today . Just as I suspected , my grandson would not entertain the notion of wearing pink wrist bands . I wish they would replace them with a more appropriate color because I would certainly like to find out if they really work .	-1
Sorry guys , did n't notice anything . I watched some youtube video and someone advertised it and I thought of trying it . But it 's just sitting on my shelf . It did n't help me . I tried it for 2 weeks .	-1
This product has not changed my reaction to poison oak when I 'm exposed to it . Zero , zip , nada . My best defense now is a good scrub with Tecnu right after potential exposure . Mostly I just try to avoid poison oak at all costs as I do have a serious reaction to it.I also notice that many of the 5-star reviews on this product were written by reviewers who ONLY reviewed this product several years ago , then reviewed nothing else . Very strange ... ..	-1
I have hard time falling asleep and any of the over the counter meds works . So after taking this i felt nothing at all but i might work for others who knows . I give it 2 stars because it doesnt make you crazy tired the next day like some other meds	-1
I bought this product on because of a recommendation on the Dr. Oz program . I found that it did not help me to sleep at all .	-1
contains sorbitol which is a powerful laxative . It gave me diarrhea . Buyer beware . I had to quit using . bought another melatonin product and it did not help me sleep as expected .	-1
sometimes i do n't understand the good reviews some products get , i just took one of these pills , put it under my tongue over an hour ago , it is 3 am now and i am more awake than when i took it , more money i wasted , needed tea spoons so i bought a whole flatware set , tea spoons not a regular size teaspoon , rag you wet and shake to keep you cool , just a wet rag , hair clippers , blade dull does n't even cut after one day , not really blaming amazon , but out of 100 things i bought over last 3 years , i have thrown away half , that were total garbage .	-1
Returning this lamp to Amazon since all it did was give me terrible , awful headaches . The light is insanely white , stark , and dreary . It reminds me of a hospital . My husband even remarked it looked nothing at all like daylight- just stark florescence . It actually made me feel like it was night time , since that 's the color light you generally see in buildings at night .	-1
The seal was brokem and the bottle oily , some was missing . It smelled heavily like pine oil that made me sick . I threw it out .	-1
I tried this but it did n't do anything for my asthma or health . Plus like someone said its really hard to take because of the strong chemical like taste . It is nasty even for me .	-1
Could never get this to do any good . Do n't know it it 's helpful to others , but it was not helpful for me . It is hot to wear .	-1
There are no clear instructions on how to put it on and when I finally figured it out it would not stay on . it ended up in the trashcan -- a complete waste of hard earned money . I wish I could give it a no star rating	-1
This did n't work well for me . I found it uncomfortable and that it did n't really do anything positive or useful . This could 've been because my particular issue was too advanced or that it required surgery , but in general I found this thing difficult to use and wear and found it very uncomfortable .	-1
So we 're trying to get pregnant and needed a conducive lube to facilitate , but unfortunately this made me feel like I was getting a yeast infection so I had to discontinue use .	-1
This did absolutely nothing for me . I still got razor bumps . It does n't work as well as a regular foaming shave gel . I feel like I just used soap and water . Never use it again .	-1
Every time I take this tablet ( just one ) it makes me feel kind of sleepy and tired . I bought 2 bottles of this because I have never had side effects with any supplement . I have taken 1 daily for about ten days , and every time I took them , I felt these side effects . So I am sure that they are responsible for this . You can search google for this kind of side effects , I have found some articles . I do n't know if it is paticularly this brand or others also , but I will not be buying this supplement anymore . A total waste of money the remaining tablets I will not use . Also did not feel or got any minimum result in losing weight while taking this . I bought this product because of all the 5 star reviews it had when I bought it , Amazon was not selling this product at the time and amazon recommended me to buy it at another online distributor .	-1
Not sure this stuff really does anything to help sleep or relaxation , but it does smell like feet for whatever that 's worth .	-1
I 'm not sure if this works because I could n't get it down.The smell is SO LOUD . As soon as I opened the container the smell slapped me in the face . It 's was indescribable . Like something died in there.No Thanks .	-1
Perhaps I have allergy to metal but I developed a zit like bump on the side of my lips . I cant say what caused that reaction .	-1
I understand that there are differing opinions on this trimmer , but after using it back to back with the Remington Precision Pro MB-400 Titanium Vaccuum Mustache and Beard Trimmer , there is no comparison on the following counts:1 ) quality of the trimming accessories - the Norelco has a flimsy cutting guide , and its all on the verge of breaking everytime you use it . Anyone who has had a previous Norelco product points this out.2 ) a ridiculously designed sideburn trimmer - It is so hard to get the trimmer set-up ! a poor design3 ) A terrible cut - if you have even a medium beard , the trimmer is very uneven . you can certainly do better.The items above are enough to walk away from this device . The reviews that critique the vaccuum are probably being unrealistic . It is in part Norelco 's fault - they set you up to expect more from the vaccuum than you get . But simple physics will tell you it is going to miss a lot of hair.It was such a bad experience , I had to review it.The Remington is superior in every way .	-1
A complete waste of money , the vacuum feature does n't work , it cuts poorly and the first time I took the cutter off to clean it , it came apart needing twenty minutes to put back together . The beard height adjustment never worked correctly after that and I had to throw it away within 6 months.JUNK ! Must be made in China	-1
This device has serious functional and aesthetic flaws . On a functional level , the vacuum is virtually useless so that at least 2/3 of the hair winds up on the counter or in the sink . I could have stayed with my non-vacuum trimmer ! Also , the blades clog and everything comes apart to clean with a flimsy , I hope I do n't break this , kind of plasticity.On an aesthetic level , this is very noisy and the noise is extremely unpleasant , sort of a sick screeching sound that I do not associate with quality . As soon as I turn it on , I want to turn it off as soon as possible . This just does not feel like a quality product . It is within a hair of it being worth the trouble to return it .	-1
The blades cut nice , but battery life could be better . The vacuum does actually work well , I was surprised . However the curved long design at the end makes an even shave under the nose impossible . Hair directly under the nose is noticably longer than at the lip . Frustrating !	-1
When my ( non-vacuuming ) Norelco trimmer would no longer take a charge , I ordered this item , not too concerned over whether the vacuum was effective or not.What I received was a poorly designed trimmer:1 . To hold the trimmer , one must place one 's hands over the vacuum air exit slots , thus throttling the vacuum.2 . The guard was so complex to attach and detach that it took 10 minutes each time to do it.3 . The closeness settings do n't actually lock in , and tend to `` wander '' toward ( 1 ) , the closest setting . And so I would find myself completing my trim with 3/4 '' length hair on one side of my face , graduating to stubble on the other.I finally threw the thing in the garbage after a week and bought a leftover non-vacuum Norelco model like the one I previously had - $ 19.99.So , if you see some poor soul walking down the street with long whiskers on one side of his face , and a 5 o'clock shadow on the other , be kind . He 's probably not dimented - just the victim of this `` new and improved '' beard trimmer .	-1
I paid $ 100 or so for this item here at Amazon and after little more than a year the little plastic clip head keeps coming off and the whole razor head assembly falls off ! My husband and I are really disaapointed with the cheap parts this razor assembly head is made of . Neither one of us can figure out why it wo n't stay on ... the metal wire clip on the inside does n't appear to be bent or broken , just refuses to stay on.To clean it now we just leave the head closed or risk fighting it trying to get it back on . Takes forever to dry that way and does n't get very clean.Yes , guys , my husband and I both use this razor ! The women 's versions ( foil type ) of a leg shaver are horrible ! I 'd bet most women do n't use them because they do n't have forever to shave their legs ! Women 's leg hair vs. men 's facial hair ... not much difference.Other than the cheaply made head assembly falling off , this shaver worked very well , except on longer hairs . If you repeatedly missed one and it gets longer than say 1/4 to 1/3 inch , be prepared to have it yanked out ... painfully ! My husband also noticed this when he got too close to his sideburns . Our advice : use the long hair attachment first .	-1
I bought this really excited . I used it the first night and I notice my face could not breathe well . I used it tonight ( the 2nd night ) My face could not breathe My pores were really clogged . I looked in the ingredients and found some ingredients like mineral oil and propylene glycol and googled them they were on the worst ingredients in skin products ... . I went to wash my face off then noticed ( near my noes left side and right ) my face was completely inflamed ... This is going straight to the trash what a waste of good money	-1
I took this for several months , and I did n't notice any improvement . It came very highly recommended , and I think it is probably a good product . It just did n't do anything for me . I have switched to Stop Aging Now 's joint product to see if it helps .	-1
I tried these for three days and they seemed to work . But then on the third night , I got a terrible case of acid reflex and had to get out of bed to take a prevacid , which worked . So I threw the licorice pills away . Waste of money .	-1
DO NOT BUY THIS HORRIBLE TASTING PRODUCT ! ! ! ! ! Natural Factors . its manufacturer , had a great pleasant tasting STANDARDIZED FORMULA Dgl but the formula was altered with no notice to this consumer . I bought four bottles via Amazon.com , which did not advise potential buyers that Natural Factors was supplying a version that is NOT STANDARDIZED . The non-standardized formula is so horrible tasting that no one would want to use it . Because I did not discover I had received 4 bottles of non-standardized Dgl formula until more than 30 days after my purchase , the seller refused to allow me to return it . I have had several communications directly with a representative of Natural Factors , which have been totally unsatisfactory . End result : I , senior citizen on fixed income , am stuck with about $ 38.00 worth of TOTALLY UNUSABLE non-standardized formula Natural Factors Dgl .	-1
Five stars for fast delivery but one for how this supplement worked , which it did not in a favorable way . Check your blood pressure while on DGL as mine spiked despite the component in licorice that is removed for this product . Had a headache for a few days and stopped taking immediately thereafter .	-1
This product offers minimal support at best . Pads tear and lose shape easily . For maximum effectiveness , use these pads in addition to achilles tendon support straps in order to alleviate strap irritation .	-1
I just waisted my money . The product has no support and slides around the foot and tendon area , so the jell pad does not stay in place . It 's not refundable so do n't waste your hard earned money ! Slipos is a good name for it . I usuall do n't write a negative review , but if I could save someone time and money it 's worth it . I have chronic tendinitis in my both feet , worse on right due to 2 surgeries but the Achilles pain is the worst and I was hoping for relief . If it sounds to good to be true it usually is ! ! They should at lest offer money back ! !	-1
The elastic works for about a week . I guess it does what it said it would do but does not last past the 7 days mark without falling down and stretching out . Good if you only need something for a week .	-1
My husband found them to be a bit too uncomfortable to wear . We bought a night splint for him to use instead .	-1
Found much better quality , do the job at the pharmacy , half the price . My pt even said there is not enough support for plantar fasciitis , which is why I purchased them .	-1
I hated to do this , but I must.Wife needs some relief for her heel pain and she saw this infomercial and wanted to try this product . No problem , it 'll only take a minute for me to research this . So I get on amazon , read a few reviews , decide to buy it from amazon to save the shipping cost and because I just like amazon . I found the product , no problem . I 'm ready to order , only to see these stupid size icons - a `` medium '' , a `` m '' a `` Xlrg m13-15 , and then `` large : w11-13/ m9-12 '' Ok , I can figure some of this out - if you select that last one you 'll get a women 's size 11-13 which is the same as a mens 9-12 , I get that . And then maybe the `` xlrg m13-15 '' means if you select this one you 'll get a men 's 13-15 which is the same as a extra large men 's . Or that could mean it 's a extra large womens ? ? ? ? ? And then there 's a `` medium and `` m '' . To me , either of those means medium . Medium what ? Men 's or women ? I 'd have to think the reason one is a `` M '' and one is a `` medium '' must be the men or women 's thing -- - but which is which ? Are they all the same ? Wife wears an 8 1/2 . So which one should I order ? If there is one thing that really gets me going like this when I 'm shopping is an unprofessional listing . Do n't companies and individuals who try to sell things on amazon check their work ? Or , is the manufacturer of the product the one 's to blame ? That would surprise me . I think it 's either just a matter of someone just does n't care about their job or a lack of education . But it 's really not too hard to figure out how to create an ad and put the proper interactive size selections in it.I was going to email amazon to clarify for me . But I changed my mind and decided to bag the whole thing . I 've already got about 1/2 hour into this , when I only expected to get a quick item for my wife , maybe 5 minutes from my busy schedule.On the other hand , I 'll note here that I want to be notified if anyone else comments - so feel free . Then maybe I 'll get my answer . If I do , maybe I 'll order it .	-1
I bought these heal cups because I was suffering from Plantas Fasia . They did n't seem to do any good for my problem so I stopped wearing them .	-1
Completely useless ! ! ! ! My feet hurt so badly after veering those for one day that I had to be not walking the next two days , just rest and ice	-1
The price is too expensive and FootSmart charges excessively for shipping . Not worth it .	-1
I do n't know how this can happen , but these blades are DULL ! I have used Venus blades for years , and have always been very impressed with how incredibly smooth the shave was ! And the blades themselves would last me forever ! I have very fine hair to shave , too ... so it 's never been an issue . But even if I used my prior Venus blades for months and months , the shave was STILL better than these right out of the box ! Strange . But I know that I will go back to using the regular old Venus blades instead , and I 'm not going to buy them online ! ( Mine were from BelowCostJML on Amazon . )	-1
For years I used the Schick Quattro for women and I always got a great shave with it . I decided to give this a try and was unfortunately VERY disappointed . The blades are so dull , even the first time you use them that you find lots of missed spots ( no , not from me forgetting to shave there.. ) - it was like I did n't even shave at all ! I had to shave each area twice just to get a halfway decent shave . You 'll also find that you have to change the blades every few shaves , which as expensive as these are , is going to cost you a small fortune . Save your money and get a better brand . Back to the Quattro I go !	-1
Very sticky . Do n't buy . I 'm picky so this might work for others , but trust me there are better lubricants available .	-1
I do not feel any effect of this product on mosquito bites at all . I do not recommend it . I am still looking for other products which maybe effective .	-1
This stuff made my gf smell like pancakes , which may not be a bad thing but it was a little disturbing . We found no benefit to this stuff over regular fenugreek pills , which are much cheaper and dont taste disgusting .	-1
This product made me feel terrible . After 3 weeks I was bloated , had back pain , and my hair growth did not improve . I do not recommend this product .	-1
Did not work and was a waste of money for me . I will not order it again and really wish I could just get my money back ! The company should have to do that !	-1
This powder 's flavor does n't even come close to the good flavor of Syntrax Nectar 's Fuzzy Navel , and it does n't dissolve nearly as well either . Live and learn .	-1
way overpriced , the gold standard or ON by optimum nutrition is a great deal , but this Jay Robb protein does n't work , i did n't even use it ,	-1
I know taste is subjective . What tastes terrible to me might be great to you . But I found this shake to have a terrible aftertaste that I 've never experienced with any other protein powder I 've used during the six or eight years I 've used protein powders.I know it is supposed to be made of high quality ingredients . I do n't know how much arsenic and other heavy metal might be in it as it was not one tested by Consumer Reports . Moreover , there is ( as of this writing ) nothing on their site about it and they do n't seem to have a contact number readily available.- Susanna K. Hutcheson	-1
I purchased a bottle 100 Vcaps , and the vitamin E was in the form of d-alpha tocopherol succinate , a pure ALPHA form and NOT the much superior mixed forms of vitamin E. The various products listed here are NOT all the same.Look at the zoomed labels for each before you buy . I am a college professor who teaches an upper level nutrition course , and I PERSONALLY feel the evidence to date suggests that the only the MIXED should be used as a supplement . The Dr. Weil brand is one such product , as are SOME of these options on this page . Order with care ! Amazon , check into this .	-1
I like NOW Foods Zinc Picolinate 50 mg but I will never buy it again because it contains gelatin capsules instead of the vegetable based capsules . Gelatin is made from animal byproducts and is not suitable for vegetarians.I like the benefits of Zinc Picolinate but I will have to find some other brand .	-1
I tried this product because of the wonderful benefits of Apple Cider Vinegar . Unfortunately the smell of this product is so intense it makes me feel sick when I open the bottle . I have tried other brands that are better and do n't stink as bad .	-1
I developed horrible canker sores within a few days after taking Now Apple Cider Capsules . I do not know if this product was the cause , but soon after stopping the sores disappeared . I have taken straight apple cider before and never had any problems .	-1
I only took one pill and it made me sick . My stomach felt heavy , I could taste vinegar all night long and my throat felt like something was lodged in it and would n't go away . I 've taken pills before but this one really made me feel ill. A waste of money . I think if you are slightly sensitive to pills , skip this .	-1
did n't work for me . Funny thing about this product , it caused me to have insomnia . Do n't know why , do n't know how . It was the only thing different in my life , that caused it . When I did n't take the product I slept fine . Just not for me .	-1
No matter what the bottle says it will do for you , it did NOTHING . I might as well have swallowed a gummy bear	-1
I was on this for two weeks , and felt horribly depressed . I talked with my doctor about it and he immediately had me stop taking it , because it clashed with my anti-depressant medication . I already knew not to take St. John 's Wort with my prescription medication , now I know to add L-Glutamine to my `` no no '' list .	-1
I ca n't recommend this . It sped up my heartbeat , and I think made me a little grouchy . As for helping with muscle and body fat , I ca n't say since I did n't use it very long .	-1
Did n't notice any difference in anything . I know this was only a limited supply , but if a supplement is going to work , it should show some sort of sign by this point.Not recommended .	-1
I was worried about using these L-Glutamine tablets since there are many warnings that this product can induce mania . While I do n't have any history of depression and I 'm not bi-polar , this was n't exactly the most settling thing to read . While the L-Glutaimine did n't make me feel anxious , it did n't make me feel anything else either.Those thinking about trying this product should know that the pills themselves are fine . They 're a bit bigger than many other supplements , but I would n't say that they 're too large . I also did n't feel any stomach aches as I 've felt with other supplements.This is a supplement that you should consult with your doctor before sampling . I did n't feel any negative side effects , but the possibility of them suggests that those seeking to use this should make sure that it 's right for them .	-1
I thought this might be a good product for me as it talked about possibly helping with mood in dieters . For me though , I need seratonin and this effects seratonin in a negative way.If you are taking any psychiatric medicine , I suggest consulting with your doctor prior to taking this.I only took a couple of these before I had to stop .	-1
I did not realize how big and heavy these compressed caplets are . The bottle itself is quite heavy . I had a gut feeling this is not right to be putting in my gut . Will they even dissolve in there ? ? ? Maybe I can use them for my chalkboard . Ca n't let good rocks go to waste .	-1
Ever since I first was struck with kidney stones I have been very aware of supplements ' dissolvability . My urologist suggested I place the pill or tablet in warm water for about an hour . If the pill dissolves it is ok if it takes much more that an hour it is not , it is that simple . To have pills sit in your body for hours or days does no good to your system and can lead to excessive stones.Unfortunately this MSM does not dissolve quickly , It sat in the water for over a day , this I am not going to risk another stone attack .	-1
Love this product but I bought 120 pills for $ 28 in August . No way I will pay $ 40 or $ 20 a month to use this . What a shame that the price increased so much . I really hope this increase is n't because New Chapter sold to Procter and Gamble .	-1
From the marketing story of these vitamins , I always thought that all the vitamins and minerals were contained and produced solely by the yeast and whole foods in this product ... WRONG.I always wondered how they were able to produce a vitamin product from whole foods that contains 100 % of all the RDA of every vitamin , when other foods-only supplements cant . Well , it 's because THEY ADD THE SAME SYNTHETIC VITAMINS AND NON-FOOD MINERALS THAT EVERY OTHER VITAMIN COMPANY USES.Read the description carefully : '' Every Man is a whole-food complexed multi-vitamin `` '' Each of New Chapter 's whole-food complexed multi-vitamins is independently certified organic . The whole-food ingredients are grown without the use of added chemical pesticides , herbicide residues , or genetic engineering . `` Yes , there are certified organic whole foods IN THERE . BUT , there are also synthetic , non food sourced vitamins and non-food minerals in there , too . THEY ARE JUST MIXED IN ( `` COMPLEXED '' ) WITH THE YEAST AND FOODS.In other words , they make a yeast culture broth , add the same synthetic vitamins that everyone else uses , culture the yeast with a few organic foods added to the mix , and then they take that whole soup and desiccate it and make pills out of it . THE VITAMINS , EXCEPT FOR TRACE AMOUNTS CONTAINED IN THE FOOD AND YEAST , ARE ALL SYNTHETIC , ADDED VITAMINS . That 's the only way they can get a consistent , assay-able 100 % RDA of all those vitamins.This type of marketing is MISLEADING and should be outlawed . After taking these overpriced vitamins and not feeling any particular positive effect except for that `` feel-good '' feeling that I was consuming whole foods and not synthetic vitamins , I now find myself angry and upset that I was conned in this way , and that I WAS consuming synthetic vitamins . If a product says it is made from whole foods , it should NOT contain synthetic , lab-produced vitamins . The sneaky thing here , is that they never say that it contains ONE HUNDRED PERCENT whole-food ingredients ONLY.The reason that these are `` gentle on your stomach '' is because they are so low-dose . If it 's vitamins you want , you 're paying three times as much for a fraction of the dosage of most vitamins . If you want to take a vitamin supplement , just get yourself a good inexpensive brand and take it with a meal because the same USP raw ingredients are used in all of them . The main difference is the binders and fillers.I will never buy this brand again . My trust is shaken . I have moved on to MegaFood brand , but I am very skeptical of all supplement companies now that claim `` whole-food '' or `` organic '' . These are just buzzwords to make you feel good but if there is not full ingredient disclosure then it 's just a scam .	-1
Is n't everyone of you CONVINCED THAT THIS PRODUCT IS ALL NATURAL FREE OF ANY SYNTHETIC ISOLATES ? Is n't THIS THE REASON that you CHOOSED it and highly paid for it ? Of course , ( included myself ) , THATS WHAT THEY WANT US TO BELIEVE , and they manage well ... ... please try to contact them and ask.. .if you 'll ever manage to get an answer you will be surprised .. ! ! If i was living in USA , i would bring forward this matter for legal investigation , not because these companies use what they use , ( it 's their right to use what ever is legaly available in the market , as all common synthetic vitamin producers ) , but because in a very sophisticated , elaborated way they mislead , they take off you the right to choose what you swallow by disguising the truth . And i consider sometimes this may be risky , there are people with allergies and intolerances ... ..After research and a lot of effords to have an answer from New Chapter regarding the kind of ingredients-vitamins they use for their `` cultivations '' ... , came out that they DO use SYNTHETIC isolates eg . : B12 cyanocobalamin , ( the cheapest , less absorbable form of b12 , the toxic cyanin ... ! ) just to mention one , as well as oxide minerals ! ( magnesium , zinc oxide ) etc..They said `` yes we use them , but we cultivate them with food , yeast ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .. '' Well its not nice to be treated as a fool , what ever cultivation is done the fact is that : the less effective CHEAPEST FORMS OF SYNTHETIC vitamins are used , and the final amound of vitamins in these supplements , is NOT the result of Pure Food Process , as i was so glad to beleive at first place ... and i guess all of you too ... After all , i dont think that the toxic cyanid ... evaporates in the final product ! When somebody goes for a high quality NATURAL product , presented in this masterpiece way , and available to pay that much , expects and needs in first hand that no synthetic isolates are used or , if this is the only way , at least the synthetic vitamins used , to be mentioned and of the safest effective , absorbable , non toxic forms , ( eg.vit.B12 as Methylcobalamin , or hydroxycobalamin , vit.B6 as P5P ... etc ) .Yes of course these forms cost much more , but This for me is called ETHIC.The question is , if companies like New Chapter and Megafood ( they also use harmfull binders as stearates , hidden under the name `` vegetable lubricants '' ! ) , are disguising truths in that way , presenting their products as `` NATURAL '' , `` WHOLE FOOD '' which kind of supplements should i trust ? Well after all this research , i ended up to believe , that the best safest way to supplement , is either certified Organic Green formulas , that they have all kinds of vitamins , minerals and aminoacids in natural form anyway , or choose products that : First : they mention all the ingredients analytically and have no fear to answer about them , andSecond : they use the highest quality first ingredients available . ( ofcource without use of binders and fillers , etc , yes , ... there are a couple of companies like this ) , For me , these are the important criterions to understand the quality of the final product , besides the GMP certificates and awards ... ...	-1
In all honesty , I really ca n't say if I experienced any real benefits from this stuff because I could n't continue taking it after it made my face breakout for the two weeks I took it .	-1
Makes me feel fatigued . Maybe it 's the combination of trying to lose weight and taking taurine ( blood sugar reducer ) that yields such an effect .	-1
Daughter did not like the flavor . She 's only 9 , so this flavor may appeal to adults , just not kids since it 's not fruity or bubblegummy flavored .	-1
March 1 , 2012 : I ordered this gum from this same store before because they did n't sell spry with titanium dioxide in it . I read the ingredients again before I ordered this time and it still said ONLY `` Ingredients Xylitol , gum base , peppermint oil ( natural flavor ) , vegetable glycerin ( humectant ) , gum Arabic ( texturizer ) , non-GMO soy lecithin ( emulsifier ) and beeswax ( glazing agent ) . '' Yes I copied and pasted it here to show you all just in case it gets changed . I refuse gum or anything else that has titanium dioxide in it . Why you ask ? Here you read for your self . `` Titanium dioxide has recently been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer ( IARC ) as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen `` possibly carcinogen to humans '' . '' [ ... ] AND `` Titanium dioxide is an inorganic compound used in a range of body care products such as sunscreens and makeup . It appears to have low skin penetration but inhalation is a concern . '' So I do n't want to chew something that is bad if I breath it in . I am VERY upset over this discovery , being I give this gum to my kids . Now I have to find a Xylitol sweetened gum for my family , again . I have been chewing this gum for years and loved the ALL NATURAL ingredients , not anymore ! By the way here is the ingredient list for the new bottle `` Ingredients Xylitol , gum base , peppermint oil ( natural flavor ) , vegetable glycerin ( humectant ) , gum Arabic ( texturizer ) , non-GMO soy lecithin ( emulsifier ) , titanium dioxide ( natural coloring ) & beeswax ( glazing agent ) . `` I DO N'T CARE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE , I CARE IF IT IS HEALTHY ! UPDATE July 27 , 2013 : I wanted to let everyone know after much research my wife found a new gum to try . Upon calling the manufacturer ( in Rhode Island ) they sent a free sample of all of their flavors in original packaging like what would be sold in stores . Another company was also contacted just before this one and the samples sent from them were packed only in a small brown envelope ( way too unprofessional and unsafe in my opinion ) plus the gum got hard and lost its flavor very quick . However , this is not the case with the second company we contacted . The gum stays soft quite a bit longer than Spry , but not as long as the Xylichew did . They have a wide variety of flavors and types and I have tried all the flavors except one so far . Amazon does carry this gum but you need to put in the correct name of the gum to find it . However my wife found better pricing from iherb.com plus with an online coupon code from retailmenot.com saved even more money and got free shipping . There is no titanium dioxide , high fructose corn syrup or soy lecithin and says to be Vegan , Gluten Free , and Soy Free . Now this gum has ingredients that must be looked at for those who are on diet restrictions in regards to certain types of vitamins , in order to prevent any problems be sure to note this and talk with your doctor first . This company also has Energy gum that is Caffeine Free and still only sweetened with 100 % Xylitol that I do enjoy a great deal . The name brand of the company is B-Fresh which you will find is because they add vitamin B-12 to all of their products . Here is a link to their website [ ... ] This does also seem like a small US company as every time I call I seem to be talking to the owner . I did have one issue when the gum arrived by UPS and so called because the gum was way overheated during transport consequently I wanted to be sure that the gum would not be a problem to chew still which the gentleman I spoke to assured me it was safe , however he wanted me to call if I noticed any problem with the flavor . There has not been any flavor issues . Now I also need to mention that the 100 ct bottles of B-Fresh gum seem to be softer and take longer to harden while chewing than the individual packages that were sent as samples to us . So I suggest buying the bottles unless you are planning to resell or pass out the individual packs . Meanwhile , here are the ingredients on the flavors we purchased : B-Fresh Breath Freshening Gum Cool Spearmint : Xylitol , Gum Base , Natural Spearmint Flavor , Vitamin B-12 500 % RDI , Gum Arabic , Carnuba Wax , Calcium Citrate , Calcium Gluconate.Solar Energy Gum Moon Melon : Xylitol , Gum Base , Natural Melong and Cantaloupe Flavor , Vitamin B-12 ( cyanocobalamin , 376mcg ) 300 % RDI , Caranuba Wax , Gum Arabic , Taurine ( amino acid , 2mg ) , Ginseng ( 1mg ) , Calcium Citrate ( 0.25mg , pH regulator ) , Calcium Gluconate ( 0.25m , pH regulator ) .Solar Energy Gum Peppermint Planet : Xylitol , Gum Base , Natural Peppermint Flavor , Vitamin B-12 ( cyanocobalamin , 376mcg ) 300 % RDI , Caranuba Wax , Gum Arabic , Taurine ( amino acid , 2mg ) , Ginseng ( 1mg ) , Calcium Citrate ( 0.25mg , pH regulator ) , Calcium Gluconate ( 0.25m , pH regulator ) .	-1
I really wanted to like this insole , give it a good review , and buy a few more for my other shoes but that is not the case . I wanted to like it because I think it is very creative to sell an insole you can mold yourself at home ( in case you are not aware , you put this in the kitchen oven for 2 minutes at 200 F and then stand on it for 2 minutes . The heat softens it so it can mold ) . This was n't an issue.The HUGE problem is I noticed my foot tends to fatigue with these insoles and I am pretty sure its because of the foam blend they use . The best analogy is that the effects are similar to walking on sand ( your foot gets fatigued faster ) .SIMPLE TEST : I placed this insole in the right shoe and a generic quality $ 10 insole in the left shoe . The right foot with this insole seemed to work twice as hard as the left foot during regular walking . I would pick almost any quality cheap insole over this one . I really ca n't walk more than 100 meters in these insoles because although someone can joke its good exercise ( like on sand ) , I really do n't like my foot getting fatigued early . For me , they did n't work out .	-1
I tried this and saw no difference at all in levels of stress or anxiety and such . At best I think it sometimes made me suddenly sleepy in the afternoon ( I was taking it at lunchtime ) and other times no effect at all ( so the sleepiness could have come from something else ) . Disappointed but we do n't all react the same way to supplements ... : - ( I have better results for anxiety with [ ASIN : B00016QT7Q Rescue Remedy ( 20ml vial ) ] ]	-1
Pros : It 's cheap.Cons : It does nothing. -- I know the main page of this product does n't specifically claim that it does anything . So in that regard , I ca n't technically find it at fault . But , I CAN.I know most of you reading this learned of this stuff from Dr. Oz . I know many of you think that this stuff helps curb your appetite , or calms you down , or makes you drowsy . I did not feel that it caused any of these effects in me whatsoever . I did not find that it did anything at all . But at least it was cheap. -- -- ** UPDATE **I 've taken this before bed at night and have noticed some differences . This stuff works like a more gentle melatonin . When I take 1-2 of these before bed , I have more frequent and very vivid dreams . I also find myself awake at 3 AM and toss and turn until I have to get up at 6:30 . This is similar to results I 've seen with melatonin . So , this stuff does do SOMEthing , but it 's hard to quantify it as good or bad ...	-1
I just finished taking these and I still stress eat and I think maybe I even ate more so than before	-1
Once again I find myself thrwarted by Dr. Oz . His promise that Relora would curb my cravings by reducing my stress level had me hopeful - so once again I ran to Amazon to purchase my `` promised land '' remedy.Did Relora reduce my stress level ? Absolutely not , if anything it increased my stress level knowing I paid so much for yet one more snakeskin oil . I think I should stop watching Dr. Oz - he 's costing me a lot of money . Something to ponder .	-1
Did n't find that this product did anything for me . It was touted for helping one reduce food cravings and for stress relief . Did n't see any difference on either .	-1
If you are suffering from adrenal fatigue , mental fogginess , restlessness , you need this vitamin , do your researchand see what is good for.Memenne .	-1
This product did n't have the results I expected . Did not raise my Low T level as advertised . I will not be reordering . In fact if it had a gurantee I would request one .	-1
i gave it 2 stars due to the allergic reaction that i experienced . more than likely this is the real thing .	-1
I found research that said this possibly may help get your cycles back and so after finishing the bottle the cycle never came . I guess if you keep it up after a few months is what might help , but I decided instead of buying more and hoping it would help to talk to my doctor first .	-1
I noticed I was very tired and headachy after taking Vitex , but I read that is a common side effect and that it was temporary . After the first week , I only noticed the tiredness increasing . I would feel almost confused at times and just plain strange . When taking it during the day , one time , I completely drove past the shopping center I was going to . I 'd go through these spells where I felt very heady , like I was going to pass out . I was only taking 250mg per day . I had high hopes for this as a treatment for PCOS , but I could n't continue with it . This does n't seem like a common result , but malaise and confusion are listed among vitex 's side effects . Maybe I should have tried vitex fruit which is less potent than vitex extract , but this is something I 'm not messing around with any more ! Back to progesterone cream !	-1
I bought this brand in a local store when I ran out of the Enzymatic Therapy brand I usually order from Amazon . The sickening sweet aftertaste led me to read the listing of 'other ' ingredients . Well , no wonder . These tablets contain three sugar alcohols - xylitol , manitol , and sorbitol - which metabolize more slowly than ordinary sugar and which the FDA allows manufacturers to include while claiming their products are sugar-free . Well , OK , scientifically they are n't literally 'sugar ' . But all sugar alcohols can cause a loosening of the bowels and intestinal distress , as attested to by Josh in his review here , and other problems have been reported associated with their use.In addition , this brand contains 'dextrates ' . Dextrate is a saccharide with a dextrose ( SUGAR ) equivalent of from 93-99 % . But here again , the FDA does not require inclusion in labels as sugar - because scientifically it is n't a sugar.It 's quite possible you will like the sugar aftertaste , especially if you still eat refined sugar products , and it 's also possible you will not suffer the intestinal distress that Josh did . Just be informed about what you are ingesting . I threw mine away .	-1
This was my favorite DGL for years . Amazon did n't have it for a while . When I saw it was back in stock , I ordered 2 bottles . Big mistake.Either I got a bad batch , or NL has changed the formula . The tablets have a different taste and texture than before . They burned my throat rather than soothed . I opened both bottles and both were the same `` new '' flavor and texture.I 've tried most of the other brands and the NL is the only one that worked . Now I 'm stuck with 2 bottles I ca n't use .	-1
My wife is very sensitive to sleep aids ( medical or `` natural ) . This did n't work at all for my wife and actually caused an allergic reaction ( despite her not being allergic to anything listed on the product label ) . I called Source Naturals regarding some of their `` natural vitamins . '' Learned that while they do n't use GMOs , they do use some synthetics . Buyer beware .	-1
I 'm not giving this 2 stars for simply not *working* for us because everyone is different . I 'm giving it only 2 stars because our friends love it but we saw literally no difference , even when two tablets were taken . Additionally , it was giving my husband very very bad stomach aches . He tried to take them two or three times for a week and the stomach aches arrived the day he took them and stopped happening the day he stopped taking them the next week .	-1
I do n't think this product works very well . Then again , I have serious sleep problems and have kind of surpassed a lot of natural remedies . So maybe it is just me . I found these to be mildly relaxing but not necessarily sleep inducing . Also you have to take several -- four -- and the pills are large . I would n't buy again .	-1
They simply did n't work , if you look at my reviews I usually always give 5 star reviews but unfortunately not with this one . I simply could n't take three horse pills every night with no results . Do n't let my review discourage you from trying these , I have serious insomnia and have been prescribed just about everything for sleeping ( Ambien , Lunesta , Xanax , etc ) . A friend told me about these vitamins but they 're cute for my situation . If prescription pills barely make a dent to your insomnia then stray from buying these as they will do nothing but give you vivid dreams ( which can make sleeping even harder at times ) .If melatonin works on you then try these they will definitely work as I have given them to family members and friends and heard great results . If you have a hard time swallowing pills then find an alternative . I consider myself a vitamin enthusiast and even I had a hard time swallowing three of these monsters .	-1
I just put hardwood floors in the kitchen and wanted something for quick sweep ups . This is not the product to do it ! It missed most of the dirt . My son tracked in some cake mud and it just pulverized it and left it on the floor . It was a bit better on the area rugs and door mat , but not worth the space to store it so I returned it .	-1
What 's a sweeper without a reliable handle ? Handle was installed according to instructions , fell apart and repaired multiple times . This product defect has persisted for too long . Until it is corrected , this sweeper will be of little use .	-1
The swivel seat arrived on time , and is , for the most part , what the manufacturer has promised . I find it a little too hard to sit on , and to use it in the car , one has to be a rather short person or have a very tall car . I am apparently too tall , because it brings me up right under the roof of the car , which is not comfortable , plus there was no room for my knees under the steering wheel . I very recently had back surgery , so this was my main purpose for buing the seat , to make it easier to get in and out of the car . Now I use it on a dining room chair by the table .	-1
the pad does not cover the & # 34 ; lazy susan & # 34 ; base . the hardwood base will cut across your thigh buttocks area . i got a small laceration on my upper thigh . proceed with caution . the only reason i am not returning it is because it is covered with my blood . '	-1
The user needs both legs to rotate the body into the car for the & # 34 ; swivel & # 34 ; to be effective . The user needs to have more control of movement than the person I purchased this for , ( stroke patient with one sided paralysis . The price was right , just did n't work for us .	-1
Fell apart after 6 months ! ! ! ALSO the elastic band is poorly sewn into the fabric and the stitching tears ! ! WORST PART ? There is a piece of wood in the back that actually rubs through the fabric . The product description should explain that there is literally a piece of wood the size of a phone book wedged into the back ! ! ! ! ! AVOID this at all cost ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I had a back injury and needed more back support but I just found this one to be too stiff such that it was n't comfortable during a full work day .	-1
Bought this to replace my old one , it is too bulky to be comfortable . Ca n't use it . Not worth the effort to return it , bought another .	-1
I ca n't understand how so many people liked this product . I suffer from lower back and neck pain . I thought this would be perfect for my car , as my back starts to ache when I drive . I 'm a small-framed woman at 5'5 & # 34 ; and 106 lbs and this back support was huge for me . In addition , I do n't know how others can use it in the car when for me , I had the seat as far back as it would go and felt like my face was right on the steering wheel . It was so thick , big and bulky . It was more uncomfortable to drive , as I was too close to the dashboard . In addition , it made my head neck farther from the head rest and made my neck hurt more . Did more harm than good and I returned it .	-1
Be warned this thing is as hard as a concrete slab , and the wings that so profusely jut out of the sides ( not really represented in photos or description ) do n't help , maybe I 've been too spoiled with Relax the Back tempurpedic products which cost 5x more , I guess you get what you pay for .	-1
Every back problem needs different types of support . I decided to give this a try and it was extremely uncomfortable for me as it was much too hard . I have upper thoracic and lower lumbar back problems . I need relief not a board.I recently bought another back pillow that worked great for me , but I decided to try this one . The one that worked for me is found on Amazon as well : AutoLogix 5834 Ortho Lumbar Wedge Seat Cushion .	-1
It is a little softer than a brick ! Does not support the bag at all ! Does not fit a back shape . The fabric is ugly , cheap , does not sit tightly on the pad , looks awfully cheap , loosing . The main material ( pad ) is aslo very cheap , hard , smells bad . It is absolutely not so accurate and nice as the picture shows . Returned within 5 minutes after the delivery . Thanks to Amazon , provided shipping label .	-1
This back cushion appeared to have the lumbar support that was mentioned in the description . Actually , it has `` flaps '' on either side but is flat in the middle -- -NO lumbar support . In my opinion this is not a quality product . I would not recommend it because it serves no purpose .	-1
I just got this item and I am so bummed because it smells horrible ! It smells like it just came out of a chemical factory even though the tag says it was made in 2012 . I am 5 months pregnant and ordered this so that I could have back support in my office chair , but I just ca n't be around this toxic odor . I put it in the garage to off-gas , but if the smell is n't gone within a couple of days I 'm sending it back . I am extremely disappointed with this purchase because I looked through the reviews and saw that other pregnant women enjoyed the product , but I guess they either did n't get toxic-smelling supports or they did n't care ... ? Even if I was n't pregnant I would n't want to be around this smell - it smells so toxic ! Ugh ...	-1
I 'm 5'3 & # 34 ; and the product felt like it was built for taller folks . In addition , the board is hard and it just was n't comfortable at all . I hope it works for talker people .	-1
The real item is much thicker than it looks on the website . After you put it into your chair , your back is very far from the back support.I regret that I bought this .	-1
Thought this would be good for support but does not fit well and pushes middle back away from seat making it unvomfortable .	-1
I have 3 others in a different brand and LOVE them , this one does NOT feel the same way , it 's too hard and uncomfortable and bulges out on the bottom too far for me .	-1
I specially got this back support for my car seat . It did not fit in the seat . I can not imagine that it would fit for many car seats because the cushion is so wide and most car seats are concave , which will not fit with cushion because it is flat .	-1
Right at this moment I do n't believe this cane is worth more than 3 STARS . I am open for suggestions after you read my humble opinion of this Duro-Med adjustable folding , attractive cane . Firstly , this is my first time every using a cane , absolutely none and no association with any user of a cane . I have compression fractures in my back and a bad knee . Presently , I am using a STRONG quod-cane , the one with the large four pointing prongs and sturdy rubber handle . Instantly using this cane I felt secure ( sure do n't with my Duro-Med cane ) and stable , meaning not about to fall down . The drawback to using this cane is vanity and my physical appearance going out in public . My stable cane makes me look ( in my mind ) sick , crippled and ailing . So being vain I checked Amazon for attractive canes , reading hundreds of reviews , checking colors , stability , etc . and pricing . Taking into consideration the pricing , appearance and reviews I decided upon the Duro-Med adjustable folding cane . Price certainly is fair and affordable . Appearance in pictures unquestionably attractive , however , I think the reviews sold me entirely . Great reviews on this product . If this Duro cane came with a storage bag - I did not receive one . ( anyone who knows about a storage case please let me know in the comment section , would greatly appreciate it . ) Firstly , this cane is constantly falling over in public places which is exceedingly annoying to me , drawing attention that I do not want to receive . I find the handle ( plastic ) not the same as the contoured rubber handle on my in-house Quad cane with large four prongs at bottom- which never falls over -NEVER ... ..My husband checked out Amazon and found the Hugo ( very popular item ) Quad-pod which we purchased and attached to my new cane . Well , after attached it swivels from where we originally placed it with the key lock , it still slips around and places itself where ever it wants or decides to stay . Annoying , for sure . Granted just a turn of the wrist and it moves back to where you actually placed it in the first place . Pain in the tush doing this constantly over and over . Now the cane stands up BUT not in our house which has plush carpeting in every room except kitchen and den . I use my old reliable four ( 4 ) prong cane in the house.When venturing to a restaurant I feel uneasy using this cane . Folding this cane is awkward ( one has to bring either an elastic or velcro ) - remember I have NO carrying case . Also with the Hugo attachment it is more cumbersome and awkward to place in one 's handbag . I am so discouraged I hate going out in public . As Bette Davis once said & # 34 ; Old age is n't for the weak & # 34 ; . Anticipating the arrival of my new cane quickly turned to tears , anxiety and disappointment . I 'm really open to suggestion on what type of cane I should purchase to feel a sense of security , comfort and eliminate the feeling of falling down in public . I know this cane is n't it.I	-1
This is an absolutely beautiful and feminine styling of cane . However , the first one I ordered had a chippedhandle and so did the one they sent in replacement . If it were not for this it 's a keeper !	-1
It amazes me to see these companies expecting us to buy their products without us having the chance to read what 's in them . Are they hiding something ?	-1
This salt was way too intense for me . I had been using another brand 's packets and they worked just great , this one however is very hard for me to use , not only is it intense , but it leaves a kind of after-burn .	-1
I do n't know if it 's the & # 34 ; Oaken & # 34 ; or some of the other botanicals in this , or a combination of any of them , but this stuff is absolutely no good for me . I 'm attempting to clear up some skin ulcers that developed subsequent to eczemic outbreaks . The ulcers have serum scabs in them that the corticosteroid cream ( that fights the inflammation ) will NOT soften , even with Eurcerin Cr & egrave ; me in conjunction with it.I remembered a situation from about a decade ago when I developed such ulcers , but was hospitalized due to mistaking these horrid eczemic outbreaks for infection that would n't respond even to intravenous antibiotics . Such sores developed , and were managed with a wound gel . Whatever gel it was worked great , and the ulcers cleared quickly . But I ran out of the gel , could n't get the exact thing from a med supply house , and reluctantly decided on one that said it had vitamin E oil in it . Wrong . That 's usually soy bean oil ; but since the gel did n't name soy bean oil as an ingredient , I tried it . It was soy bean oil , alright . I broke out in hives , but knew immediately what it was . Prednisone and another , prescribed gel soon controlled the outbreak and sped the healing.I thought something in this might not be good for me , and it was n't . I returned it , earlier today . I 'm assuming the credit will be forthcoming just fine .	-1
This is a review for the 4 ounce Avon SKIN-SO-SOFT Bug Guard PLUS IR3535 Insect Repellent Moisturizing Lotion - Clearance SPF 30 Gentle Breeze scent . Manufacturer claim : Effectively repels mosquitoes , deer ticks , black flies , sand flies , gnats , no-seeums and biting midges . PABA-free . Nongreasy . With vitamin E and aloe . Keep out of reach of children.For years I 've heard how great Avon Skin So Soft is for repelling mosquitos and how all kinds of outdoorsmen and women swear by it . So I bought 3 bottles at $ 6.95 each ( free shipping ) . Wish I 'd only bought one , wish I had gone to a local Avon dealer . If I had , I 'd have been able to try it out first , and I would have known it was not for me , not worth the price I paid , or any price.I give it one star because I 'm not able to give it zero stars . It gave me zits all over my face ( clearly not noncomediagenic as I expected it would be since it claims to be `` nongreasy '' ) .And the smell/scent was so strong it gave me a horrible headache . I eventually had to wash it off because I could n't stand the smell.But , even though I only had it on my skin for about 30 minutes it was long enough to cause me to get a face full of pimples . I 'm in my 50s and have n't had to deal with zits for years , until putting this crapola on my face.The headache lasted for hours , until I took sinus meds that made me sleepy so I had to take a nap . The entire day was ruined , had to sleep off the headache . Took several days to get rid of the pimples.Adding to this mess , even worse than the smell , the headache , and the zits - I got a mosquito bite while wearing it ! I know because I watched the mosquito land on my arm and felt it bite me . Skeeter must have loved this stinky crap . Seems it attracts them - it does NOT repel them.Also , the following two issues were not included in deciding my star rating , but some consumers might find it helpful ... > The message `` Please note that in your shipping confirmation you will be asked to let us know if you are currently receiving service from an Avon Representative . If you are , please follow the link provided in the confirmation so that s/he can receive proper credit for your Avon order placed through Amazon.com . '' was posted on Amazon 's website when I ordered this item and I was happy knowing someone local would get credit for the order , but that did not happen . I was not asked anything during shipping confirmation and the seller is in Texas . My billing address is currently NY and it was shipped to me in WA . Not even close to TX . I 'm sure they could have found a dealer closer to me , but they did n't even try . This is another reason I wish I had dealt with a local Avon dealer in person . I was expecting a local Avon dealer to get credit for the sale , but they did not. > The Amazon seller who sent me the item was Moshya Home Furnishings . The items ( 3 bottles of this useless stuff ) were shipped later than expected and received after the July 4th weekend . I was sent an email saying the shipment would be late , but not until it was too late to cancel the order and find it locally . Had I known it would be late when I ordered it I would not have placed the order from this seller.NOTE : After I made the purchase and posted the above review I noticed the title of the item has the word `` clearance '' in it . Maybe it 's discontinued because they know it does not work well ? NOTE : Feeling ripped off and lied to I did further research about Skin So Soft and this product . I was under the impression what I was getting was the ORIGINAL Skin So Soft ( the stuff people have raved about for years ) packaged as a bug repellant , but in fact what I got is NOT the original Skin So Soft . What I got was a smelly lotion with a chemical added to it with the Skin So Soft name - clearly it is not Skin So Soft lotion , which I find deceptive on the part of Avon . The chemical in this product is called IR3535 and this chemical is NOT in the original Skin So Soft . Deceptive because the original Skin So Soft , using the original formula , was the product so many people raved about for years . This new product , which they are calling Skin So Soft , is not the same product , is not the product or formula outdoorsmen and women loved as a bug repellant . Avon knows this is not the original formula , is not the product that made Skin So Soft famous as a bug repellant , and this should be made clear on the label and in advertising - NOT THE ORIGINAL SKIN SO SOFT PRODUCT OUTDOORSMEN DISCOVERED AND RAVED ABOUT FOR YEARS ! ! ! !	-1
Have used other Spry products and like them . This just has an awful taste to me . will bring them in to work and hope that someone else might like them . Each to his own . This was a real `` yuk '' for me .	-1
I was hoping this would n't be so very sweet and would not actually taste or smell so strongly of strawberry nesquick , but was disappointed . I will give these away to a friend I suppose , and stick to the gum flavors I know I like .	-1
I eat the exact same macronutrient split every day at the exact same time , so I know what I am consuming and when . I am very regular . I find that I must be particularly sensitive to Xylitol because , at least with this item in particular , 2 grams of it consumed once will create bad karma in my intestinal tract , to say the least . It says not recommended more than 4 grams on the container but you can eat these things like candy as another reviewer notes . As an alternative I tried Xylitol gum from another company and it has not produced these effects . Shop around .	-1
I order a ton of stuff on Amazon , but this was the worst thing I ever purchased . They were uncomfortable to wear first of all and a pain to wash . I put one through the washer to try it out and it was completely warped as well as torn . The little strings were hanging everywhere and it shrunk like crazy . But honestly hand washing did not help how uncomfortable they were . I would not buy these again , please try another product .	-1
I 'm so glad I only bought a three pack . I purchased these products from this brand as well as two others . These shrunk in the dryer quit a bit and I had trouble getting them to lay flat and go back to their originial shape after washing and drying . I also purchased Fuzibunz brand- and they held up much better in the wash and for wear ! But for the price , none of the brands are really worth it . If you sew , google for a pattern . I made an entire month 's worth with 22 dollars worth of material and supplies . I love the ones I made so much better than the three brands I bought .	-1
I took this product as directed for 3 weeks and NOTHING truly happened . Initially , I had a little rumbling in my intestines and had watery stool for about a day and then absolutely nothing happened after that . My intestines substantially cleansed after one day , I do not think so , so I 'm moving onto another cleansing process .	-1
Would have found something else if I had known how big these caps are . Could n't care less about the other b/s they put in them beside vitamin C .	-1
NOT GOOD	-1
I 'm not a doctor , but my doctor told me to try some Saw Palmetto berries when he said my flow rate is kind of low and could not find any other problems with me . I honestly did not feel any difference after taking them , I 'm glad it worked for other people but it does not seem to affect me much .	-1
Plain and simple . This product does not do what it claims .	-1
ive taken quite a few different kinds of natural pills to control weight , i would say most of them have worked , except for this one , in fact i think this one may have made it worse , so i honestly would not recommend these	-1
I am a big fan of Dr.Oz and have tried a few of the supplements etc that he has recommended on his show , this being one of them . I was disappointed in the results . To be honest , I do n't need to lose weight , I am a personal trainer and a female bodybuilder but I do like to test products that may benefit my clients . Can 't say I was impressed by this product . The only thing I got was digestive upset . Very disappointed .	-1
I knew that this product has been banned in some countries because people have actually choked too death using this herb . I purchased it anyways and followed the directions thinking that perhaps others disregarded the directions and did not drink enough water with the pills . I took my first pill with 8 oz of water and within 15 minutes experienced moderate choking . My next pill , I increased my water to 16 oz and only experienced a milk choking feeling . I used this product for two month with a slight choking sensation each time and never lost a single pound . My doctor said this product is dangerous and has never been proven to result in weight loss . The entire two months , I went around with a suffocating strangling sensation for no reason .	-1
I do not know where the positive reviews came from but they were the primary reason I went out to get these pills . I took the recommended three pills 20 minutes before meals along with water . I didnt feel full before the meal and even after . I still felt hungry and even hungrier . I am wondering if the people praising this product think it works because of the amount of water you need too drink with it.You need too drink at least 24oz or else you will get a `` stuck '' feeling in your throat or choke . Its midnight and im eating a PB & J ; sandwich , yogurt and apple juice because im hungry . Its a `` healthier '' snack compared too what I could be eating but the question is why am I eating at midnight packing on another 500+ calories I need too burn off ? I read these pills are supposed too curve my cravings and I am not taking 4 or 5 pills to feel the effect because three is hard enough too swallow as it is . I just hate wasting money . I would sell the rest of the bottle if I didnt feel guilty about selling products to the American populace that I know dont work .	-1
I finished the whole bottle and I do not see any improvement with my BP readings.This product also gave me an acidic stomach as the side effect .	-1
does n't help me with bruising	-1
This works but the taste is god awful . I will go back to using the pellets that do n't taste like chalk .	-1
Got this along with the Arnicare Cream . Used these on many occasions with absolutely NO noticeable benefit . Easy to take , just put the little tabs under your tongue and let them dissolve . They dissolve very quickly , and have a sweet , sugary taste - candy-like.No pain relief came from using this ALONG with the cream , and I had a bruise that did not go away very quickly while using these tabs AND the cream at the same time . Put the cream on my sore muscles , and on the bruise at least 6 - 7 times a day for over two weeks . Absolutely NO benefit ! Save your money	-1
Why does this vendor cover the dosing directions with another bar code label ? I was able to remove part of it to barely see the directions . Makes me wonder about the quality of the product and the vendor.It would have been helpful if these same directions were included in the Amazon product description . These pills are intended to be dissolved under the tongue not swallowed . Dosage is 4 pills - 4 times a day . The bottle provides 15.625 days of medication . Why not dispense a quantity equal to full days ? Hope the product works !	-1
I read the reviews and did no further research . Bad mistake . I took these pills for about two weeks sometimes at the max dose . Yes they did help my TMJ pain but they made me sick . They made my heart flutter , upset stomach , nausea and finally vomiting . Google it and u will see it is also called Wolfsbane ... what they used to kill wolves with . This stuff is dangerous and toxic and can cause heart problems . My bottle did a slam dunk in the garbage can . It is criminal not to have a warning on this bottle .	-1
I really wanted to like this , but it is just not something I seem to be able to adjust my taste buds to . I had read reviews other omnivores liked it , and it was n't just for vegans or vegetarians , so thought it would be better than it is . The quality of the product seems fine - even flakes and nice color , but oh , the taste is something that ruins oatmeal or anything else I 've tried it in .	-1
I was dissolving this in cider vinegar with the aim of increasing calcium in the body . However , was still experiencing calcium being pulled out.However , did more research and on the way discovered Dr. Robert Morse , ND and his over 800 YouTube videos , AND at the same time learned about bio-available silica AND the liver 's ability to `` transmute '' ( yes , `` transmute '' , something I did not know before ) it into the calcium the body needs and can use.So , I 'm letting go of purchasing isolated solutions , or `` isolates '' as the answer to health issues and I am starting my water fast de-tox as the first step . It 's rigorous and best to read up about it first , but instead of throwing money at chancey solutions , I 'm taking responsibility for and trusting in my body 's innate ability to heal itself , and balance itself out.I doubt I will ever again purchase Dolomite Lime , LOL ! What a silly girl I was : - ) )	-1
Not really worth it , does n't control appetite nor help you lose weight , is not worth buying , save your money , just cut out sugar and starches and you will lose . I always say I am going to do this and I do n't . Its bad habits , if you break bad habits then you can lose .	-1
I ordered this product because so many reviews were saying the health benefits were so wonderful including enhanced memory , better digestion , etc . As soon as I received the product , I took one per directions . About an hour later my stomach began cramping ( and I was shopping so I had to rush home ) . I was up all night with stomach cramps and diarrhea . The next morning I had a terrible headache . I had planned on giving these to my mother for her memory loss . No way will I do it now . Perhaps the FDA should be more observant of this product and the & # 34 ; too good to be true & # 34 ; claims .	-1
I tried this because I read it was good for calming , but it made me feel odd . Ca n't really explain how , just not right . I prefer GABA for relaxation .	-1
I had my gallbladder out 4 years ago and I did n't notice anything while taking these enzymes . I took one at every meal for over a week and felt no different . Oh well .	-1
I used to use this product a few years ago and it seemed to work fairly well . It seemed they changed the formula and I seemed to notice a negative effect . I did not seem to need enzymes for some time but in the last several months I have needed them . I finally went back to try the Source Naturals - this time the side effects in my body bordered on feeling toxic - as if I had put poison in my body . I will never put one of these in my body again . Please listen to you are own body.The enzymes that have been both working well and have been causing no side effects that I have been able to discern are the Life Extension enzymes - I have been pretty happy with these ( yes , I was surprised that a less known brand would be so much better than Source Naturals ) .	-1
it might work for someone not in my case ..i have a hard time digesting foods like carbs i get gessii ... so iwould not recomment	-1
As someone who has been battling sleep issues , I have become reliant on prescription meds to get a full uninterrupted night of sleep . This melatonin was recommended to me by a couple of friends AND I also read several reviews on Amazon.Unfortunately for me- after a week of trying/ these did absolutely nothing to help me relax/sleep.I was thinking that maybe people who believe this works were experiencing the 'placebo effect ' , but I really wanted it to work , and it did n't . The taste too was enough to get me to dry heave : ( I actually threw out the rest of the bottle .	-1
I started taking this to boost my testosterone levels but I had to stop taking it a week after starting due to terrible headaches and upset stomach . Those issues stopped the day after I stopped taking it .	-1
Zinc should be taken in a ten to one ratio with copper . This much zinc alone can cause a copper deficiency . Research this carefully and proceed with caution .	-1
Source Naturals Phosphatidyl Choline 420mg , 90 Softgels is not a vegetarian product.Other companies are able to make softgels that do not contain any animal byproducts . Source Naturals is using gelatin in their softgels . I had assumed that gelatin in softgels had been phased out because none of my other supplements use them.If you are vegetarian , you should avoid this product and probably anything else made by Source Naturals.In the future , I will be buying a choline supplement that does not contain gelatin.I am very disappointed that a company that has the word `` natural '' in their name would still use gelatin when most other companies have stopped using it . I am also disappointed that the Amazon website did not list that it contained gelatin in it 's product description .	-1
Update 10/15/2012 : I appreciate all of the comments to my review . I just want to say I know what ppm means . With much research ( mind you I am not a doctor , nor do I play one anywhere ... ) my research finds that the optimal color for colloidal silver is clear to light/pale yellow . Colors that are dark gold , orange , red , blue , black , etc . are a sign that the silver may have begun to `` clump '' together . I still use colloidal silver , and I still buy Sovereign Silver brand . The main thing is for you to do your research and buy what you think is best for you . That is one of the great things about feedback/reviews.I have used colloidal silver for many things . I usually buy Sovereign Silver brand . The last bottle I ordered of it had a broken dropper ( they have a glass dropper ) . I decided to try Source Naturals brand as it has good reviews , and price per ounce is comparable ... Well , I got it in , and when I opened and went to use it , I noticed that it is a dark yellow gold color ... looks rusty almost ... Well , I thought maybe that is not unusual , maybe it is just the brand ... as Sovereign Silver is always clear , looks like water . I did some research , and found that colloidal silver really should be clear , any color is a sign of an inferior product . Now inferior does not necessarily mean bad for you ... but I did n't want to take the chance . I sent it back and re-ordered Sovereign Silver brand ... It came in today , I opened it and it is clear as a bell . So , for me , I will be sticking with Sovereign Silver brand .	-1
This did not do anything for me . After going through two bottles I felt zero difference . I take other supplements and notice improvement so this is just not worth buying for me .	-1
Heard about this spray at Dr. Oz 's show . Did n't do much with my sore throat and the spray on the bottle is too strong making me gag . Tastewise it 's not too bad .	-1
I bought this to see if it helps improve my tinnitus . I have taken it for over 6-7 weeks and no positive result . I was hoping the Bioflavonoids will help . In fact , my tinnitus is getting louder than ever .	-1
I ca n't really say it 's the lack of efficacy of the product . I still have the terrible ringing in the ears . I really could n't believe a vitamin supplement would help , but I hoped . Just a learning experience . It may be of better use to others with less severe tinnitus .	-1
The Nature 's Life brand , even with 30mg zinc is not as effective for me as http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019GVXHS/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1 ? ie=UTF8 & psc ; =1 & smid ; =A3SY7P2NFH5KUXThe Nature 's Life is in vegetarian capsule form and the Country Life is in tablet form although all other ingredients are the same.Even though the Country Life is 5mg less , it gives me a more consistent libido ( well known zinc effect ) whereas the Nature 's Life has no libido effect whatsoever . This is noticeable by the end of the day after taking the first dose . I used a half bottle , approximately 125 capsules before I went back to the last few tablets in the Country Life bottle that had been sitting in the back of the shelf for 125 days . Each day , by the end of the day , there was noticeable libido improvement *and* the bottle 's expiration date is February *2013 ! *All I can figure out is the Nature 's Life capsule is just not absorbing as well as the Country Life tablet .	-1
that is Utah company sources their raw materials including minerals like magnesium , from China and other less than reputable environs , then manufactures the pills and tablets in Utah ? Do you trust the legitimacy of magnesium , or any minerals or herbs coming from China ? I do n't .	-1
When I opened the bottle , I got an unpleasant surprise . One of the capsules had burst in transit and emitted a cloud of white dust over everything within three feet.I gamely tried a capsule with my breakfast the next day , but it left my stomach queasy . I never had this problem with the tablet formulation by Nature 's Life . Amazon , please bring back the company 's magnesium tablets . I ca n't tolerate the capsules ' muss and side effects .	-1
Sadly , I just went ahead and returned these when I realized that if I trimmed them down they would frey , and I would need to trim a lot to be able to use my hands because they are pretty thick . Could work for nighttime , but I use cotton gloves and these are just too bulky for overnight . I think if your fingers are really long and you watch a lot of TV and sit around they could warm your hands , but I 'm far too active for these .	-1
do n't know how so many people gave this a good review . Terrible , After washing them by hand , it lost its tightness . Even then they were not comfortable . Did not work for me .	-1
I tried a pair of these to see if they would help my arthritis , but I was disappointed . They were quite tight , even though I measured my hands to choose the appropriate size . Because they were so tight it was difficult and painful for me , with my arthritis , to put them on . I did n't like the feel of the fabric either .	-1
Needs to be More Flexible To Hard Protection Fine To High On The Heel For Plantars Foot , May Help With Your Arches	-1
The heel part is great but the rest is too thin . It actually makes the rest of my foot hurt more since the heel is cushioned and the rest is not while I walk.I had bought several pairs from Footlocker through the years and had hoped these were the same ( certainly look identical ) . But they were a waste of money .	-1
These claim to be for high arches , and my arches are HIGH . Upon arrival I had to open them to try for my foot pain- and I could not feel any support under my arch at all . The cushion is OK , so if that is all you want I am sure there are less expensive versions out there . This is NOT a high arch support .	-1
I felt these were too light for me . Not at all as nice as some other insoles that I 've come to depend on .	-1
I ordered 2 pair from Amazon at the same time . One came directly from Amazon and the other from Therapyyourself , Miami , Fl thru Amazon . I did not open pkgs until I was ready to take to Podiatrist to adjust them to my foot problem . We opened the pkg and they were not only dirty they had been cut around the toe box to make them smaller ! Since I do n't know which one they came from I had no recourse . This is just disgusting and I hope they did n't come directly from Amazon as I have had very few problems with Amazon.Secondly , I have worn these Spencos for years and they were great . These have different bottoms and do not work from my foot problem so I wasted my money.The only positive thing I can say is they were cheap . I always paid $ 22 + tax and these were $ 12.99 and $ 13.23 . Now I see why . Quality and design leave a lot to be desired . I would not recommend these .	-1
I ordered size 11-12 . So these should fit in size 11 shoes , right ? They do n't . They do n't even fit in my size 12s ! They are about an inch too long.Definitely order a size down.I ca n't comment on how well they work , since I ca n't get them into my shoes .	-1
i did not buy these but did two other spenco inserts . and this is what was at issue with each of them ... and if it with two others then is it with these as well ... this is what happened with the two i bought..the intense chemical smell was strong enough for our mail carrier to comment , what was in the box . we opened the amazon box and WHEW ... such an ultra strong chemical smell . i have smelt the same in other items originating from china , where these inserts are made.i set them outside the house as they make the house reek . by morning they still were horrible in smell.i called spenco and while the rep was nice , the quality control person could have cared less . his attitude was the smell will go away . WHEN ? , i wonder what the chemicals in the ahhesive were and what effcet they would take ona person 's health . even after a long time IF the smell were to go away , would these chemicals remain and cause health issues.i have gone thru stage 4 cancer treatment and want no more of that . that is the worse pain i have ever gone thru and i am a tough sonofabitch . that i lived is owing to my toughness . but cancer is scary . and if these can in any way be a cause , then i want no part and take this time to warn you of your choices in this item.it may well do what it says , i will not know because i will NOT even slightly take THAT RISK.i was disappointed in spenco 's attitude about this issue . oh they would have taken them back ( at my expense ) BUT that was not my issue nor the issue at hand . safety is the issue , and they were not concerned about that . yep , just let them air out and all will be ok . NOT ! !	-1
Product is definitely misrepresented as a `` cooling wallet '' because it does NOT keep insulin cold . I trusted Frio 's misleading promotional baloney and ruined four full insulin pens on a recent road trip . All four pens were ice cold from the refrigerator when I put them in the wallet -- which was prepared exactly as instructed -- and all four pens were warm by the time I got to my first destination ( five hours in the car ) . I had to drive an extra 35 miles to find a Walmart to refill my prescription , buy an Igloo cooler and load it up with ice from the motel . If you read the fine print on Frio 's website you 'll see that they actually promise only to keep the temperature of your insulin between 77 to 79 degrees , which makes it useful ONLY for an insulin pen already in use that can be stored at room temperature ... not for unopened pens that require refrigeration ! Shame on them for using phrases like `` refrigeration not needed , '' `` keeps insulin safe without the need for refrigeration '' and `` lasts four times longer than an ice pack . '' Save your money .	-1
Did n't make a noticeable difference in patellar pain . I would give it 1 star but I bought a more expensive strap ( Procare with two straps to pull and tighten in addition to the velcro ) and gave that 1 star , and this one was MUCH cheaper and had about the same impact , so this one can get an extra star for cost .	-1
Like one of the heavier Mueller braces , this one has a round plastic tube sewed into the strap . I can not for the life of me figure out what purpose this serves , other than allowing the strap to migrate up and down below the knee as it rolls with the leg movement . The strap , and any sewn in support or stiffener for the strap , should be FLAT ! I will return this as worthless . I gave it two stars because it is well made . So while it is engineered poorly , the quality is good .	-1
I did n't realize these had minimal support until I tried them on . The support bar that goes under your kneecap is so small I did n't feel any pressure or support at all . I could n't use them .	-1
Just wrote a kicking review about a knee braces and theKneedIt Knee Braceand should have copied it here so please hit that link and you 'll know why in detail backed by medical facts that bands and braces are BAD for your knees and legs ! ! Please do n't use them ! !	-1
I too was preparing for a wax and it did absoutely nothing and I even waited about 3 minutes just to make sure it set it ... still nothing . There is a stinging pain after you spray it on , it was very uncomfortable . Save yourself $ 8 .	-1
THIS PRODUCT DID NOTHING FOR ME.. MY TEETH ARE THE SAME AS THEY WERE . GLAD IT WAS ONLY 1.33.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE , IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS JUST PUTTING WATER ON MY TEETH .	-1
I used this product but could see not difference in my teeth shade . Maybe good for someone but not for me .	-1
I only wore these once and once was enough . The band at the top came loose and soon the stocking was down around my ankle - embarrassing enough that I would never order them gain .	-1
Does n't provide any pressure support and got a huge run the first time I put it on . Was very surprised because Jobst is usually good quality - maybe I just got a crappy pair.If you 're looking for any level of compression support , go with the higher compression levels . This provides less support than non-compression hose . I do n't have ultra skinny legs and the hose fit loosely .	-1
one of the pair tore while pulling up , the other on would n't stay up it would fall down to the knee . I will be returning this product .	-1
It does nothing for calming , or even sleeping . Has a horrible smell I can only imagine how it tastes . Stopped giving before full bottle cause the was NO effect	-1
This does n't have the same effect on kids as the regular Valerian has on adults . My daughter is 21 months old and it barely did anything to her the first time she took it , and the second time and there after it did n't do anything .	-1
I purchased two different brands of 5-HTP both in 50mg capsules , the first brand I tried was a small bottle of Natrol 5-HTP which seemed to help somewhat with my sleep for the first weeks , then I started to have nightmares one after the other awakening sometimes 5 to 20 times a night , I decided to stick with it and ordered the NOW-5-HTP and after taking 50mg once a day at bed time the side effects were completely different then the ones I had taking the NATROL brand , I could not get to sleep and I had the reported muscle weakness along with ringing in my ears , Needless to say I will look for something else to help me get a good nights sleep , I was really hoping this would help me as it has for the many people who have reported their satisfaction with it in helping them .	-1
I regularly use 5-HTP for depression with insomnia . But this brand tastes truly disgusting . I gag every time I take one . I finally just purchased a different brand . This was a waste of money .	-1
Lactose supplement medications seem to come in two strengths : effectively take one at a time or take three at a time . So far as I can tell none of the various lactose supplement products on Amazon actually state the strength/dosage . I guessed wrong on this one , expecting the one at a time version . At three per meal , it turned out a good bit more expensive per dose than the locally-available Target or Rite-Aid house brands .	-1
I must say this is absolutely the worst taste for MY taste buds and therefore can not get it down no matter how diluted ... anymore . I did give this 2 stars because the 3 times I managed to hold my breath and get this stuff down , it gave me this very clean energy if that makes any sense . I felt good and I suddenly craved a big garden salad instead of junk food for lunch which tells me if you can stomach the algae taste your going to feel a lot better physically over the long run . I LOVE my barley grass and hate wheat grass so I guess I just have sensitive taste buds ! I will try to mix the 1 tsp . in my next green smoothie but the after taste will probably still be there .	-1
I dont know why it made me very dehydrated and gave me headaches , then i read that i need to refrigerate it after opening wich i didnt do , which maybe was the problem .	-1
Spirulina is LOADED with PURINES that raise uric acid levels hugely ! I never had any gout symptoms in my life until I started taking spirulina a couple of years ago . After a week or two , I started having bizarre and scary pain in my toes during the night and in the morning . I researched and discovered that spirulina has an extremely high purine content ( purines - > uric acid - > gout ) . My symptoms disappeared the day after I stopped taking it.I had never had gout before , and no one in my family has ever had it . No human group has ever been known to eat spirulina , except Mayans/Aztecs who ate it in small amounts before battle , and destitute people in Chad who harvest it from a lake.Spirulina is 99 % marketing , and 1 % health benefit .	-1
This WAS a very good product . Now - who can say ? I 'm scared to reorder.Radiation in the Pacific is reaching very worrisome levels. [ ... ]	-1
I take a LOT of supplements and noticed increasingly severe gastro upset . It took awhile and several Dr appts before I discovered on my own what magnesium stearate was doing to me . Just a word of advice/warning . Be careful with products that contain this artificial product .	-1
Directly from the company . & # 34 ; Rainbow Light products are not gmo free . Rainbow Light is working with the non gmo project and with vendors to source non gmo raw ingredients , this is a huge task and certain challenges remain with a few ingredients . These include vitamin C ( originally derived from corn dextrose ) and vitamin E ( originally derived from soybean oil ) . & # 34 ;	-1
I take the rainbow light prenatal and I really like it , so I thought I would try these for my four year old . I was a bit worried she would not like the taste , which she does not . But I get her to eat it with her Omega gummy vitamin and she is able to tolerate it . But ever since we started with these vitamins , she has had very painful gas to the point of screaming in pain . I was very worried when she started these symptoms , but can only conclude they are the result of these vitamins . Nothing else in her diet had changed . I really wanted to love these vitamins , but they just do not settle well with my daughter . Plus the fact I could only get her to eat one a day , so she never recieved the full does of two for a four year old . Has anyone else expirenced this ? Do n't get me wrong , I LOVE Rainbow vitamins , but not for my child .	-1
No changes with my digestion issues .	-1
You may have a wonderful product but if you ca n't improve the lid ( does n't stay closed ) on the top of bottle while in the fridge ; what 's the point . I had to find and empty plastic bottle with a good top , wash it and transfer the Now Foods Acidophilus to keep them in the fridge . Yeah , the fridge where we thaw out chicken , fish , and store left over . 8 billions good bacteria ... what is it worth when the lid ca n't stay on ? In the future I will buy cheaper , less powerful stuff in a better container .	-1
But it sure does cause bloating of 10-12 lbs . After being on an 800calorie diet per day for 10 days and also taking CLA , my body weight went up 12 lbs . How is this possible on that low calorie diet . I began researching and it appears many people experience bloating from CLA . That could be part of the science of reducing body fat by forcing it out , or maybe it actually is building muscle , however I did n't see that kind of increase . The only increase I saw was on the scale . Gaining 12 lbs after 10 days at minimum calories per day was n't working for me .	-1
I have used both the Mach 3 and the Mach 3 Turbo razors and so I decided to give the Power version a try as well . I expected an improvement over the shave I get with the Mach 3 Turbo . I have been trying it for about a week now and overall have decided that the Power is not worth the extra cost . I do n't feel it gives me a better shave than the Mach 3 Turbo and I will not be purchasing additional blades once the ones that it came with wear out.In addition to the lackluster shave , I found that I often turned the razor off by accident due to the poor location of the power button . I also did not really like the feel of the vibrating razor on my jaw because the vibration is transmitted right to the ear drums which is annoying.In summary , I do n't think that the Mach 3 Power is worth the extra cost . If you are looking for an improved shave , I would recommend trying the Schick Quattro instead because I think gives a better shave than any of the Mach 3 razors .	-1
Not a fan - LOOKS awesome on the package - I had high hopes for this hoping it would taste even better than the Super Cookie Crunch ( which is great ) . It has that phony protein bar taste and almost turned my stomach when I had it on an empty stomach . I threw the rest away ... .	-1
Incredibly rich and tasty ! Lists lots of protein , so that 's good . But , watch out for sugar overload ! Why it has to contain so many grams of sugar -- for a health bar -- is beyond me . 26 grams of sugar in the Apple Crisp ! OMdiabetes ! To my knowledge , all the Colossal protein bars have extremely high sugar levels . The wrapper is super noisy ; try handling one in the quietness of your home without waking up or disturbing someone ... forget it . Again , on the plus side the bar is really tasty and alleges high protein ; on the down side , sugar quantity is sky high and the wrapper is really noisy .	-1
I hate to say this product did not work for me . I have insomnia as a side effect of an antidepressant I use , so not many things are helping , even prescription aids . This may work great for those who have an occasional insomnia , but not so much in my case .	-1
I have bought natrol time released melatonin a few years ago and it worked , but now it makes no difference when we take it .	-1
This was a gift for my girlfriend and they are not working . Better to try something else . Not sure what that would be .	-1
If you do n't take any other supplements and just want a sleep aide or something maybe this is a good cheap option for you.I take many different supplements and they all & # 34 ; helpfully & # 34 ; will try to throw some b6 in . 10mg here , 15mg there . It adds up . B6 is the only B vitamin you have to watch out for with toxicity ! Upper limits have been set to as low as 25 mg per day and max out at 100mg . You can get nerve damage and neurological side effects if you take too much of this stuff so do n't ! If you are taking a multivitamin - CHECK THE B6 CONTENT . If you are taking some & # 34 ; energy shot & # 34 ; - CHECK THE B6 CONTENT . It adds up.In addition , they give the generic pyridoxine hydrocholoride form that you see in every junk vitamin . A good portion of the population does not even metabolize this fully ( myself being one of them ) . Even if you do n't know , better safe than sorry and get the P-5-P form ( Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate ) . If your vitamin has this , you know it 's above average quality , which this is not.In addition , if you suffer from mood issues , try 5-HTP instead of melatonin . It activates melatonin in a similar way but also stimulates serotonin for mood . I basically just got this while I was waiting for my 5-HTP to arrive because it was on sale ... bad idea !	-1
This was for my son who needs to focus and calm down . We used this but did n't notice any difference .	-1
I 've taken this mySelf and so has my son . I do n't think it 's worth buying again . It does help calm but wears off quickly and causes some indigestion . It tastes extremely sweet and bitter at the same time . Terrible taste . And also has some irritability when wearing off if taken everyday	-1
We 've tried using this off and on for a period of nearly a year and it simply does n't work for our little guy . If anything , it makes him worse . Oh , well . It was worth a try . We switched to a child 's melatonin product to calm him down so he 'll go to sleep at a decent hour , and that DOES work .	-1
These supplements did not affect me much at all so I would not buy them again maybe they work for some people but I do not see any effects from them .	-1
Do n't fool yourself , this does nothing.Let 's be honest , 95 % of people looking into choline are trying to get some cognitive enhancement by combining it with a piracetam ( good idea ) but this Choline Bitartrate does nothing and this brand is a bad value .	-1
I did n't feel noticeably different in any way during the day . I even stacked it with DMAE and Aniracetam , but still did n't feel any different . If it helped anything , it was n't enough to notice . Sits on the shelf unused now .	-1
After taking the entire bottle , it did not do anything to reduce the PMS symptoms I deal with every month . I switched over to another brand and finally noticed a difference in reduced PMS symptoms .	-1
I love GU products so this rating has nothing to do with performance or the GU product itself . It only has to do with taste . I did not like the taste of this one at all .	-1
I just started trying all the flavors of this drink and there is a palatable `` undertaste '' - sort of `` chemically '' - compared to a drink like Premier Protein or Atkins Advantage , these have a distinct disadvantage . They ca n't be resealed and half of the drink runs down the side of the carton.Try the product for yourself and decide . It 's a personal choice .	-1
I give it one star not because it 's pricey nor because I do n't like the taste : It 's not and I do.What 's seriously wrong with the stuff is its artificial sweeter , acesulfame potassium. & # 34 ; Acesulfame-K is a potassium salt containing methylene chloride , a known carcinogen.Reported side effects : Long term exposure to methylene chloride can cause nausea , headaches , mood problems , impairment of the liver and kidneys , problems with eyesight and possibly cancer . Acesulfame-K may contribute to hypoglemica.Concerns : Of all artificial sweeteners , acesulfame-K has undergone the least scientific scrutiny . Early studies showed a potential link between the sweetener and development of multiple cancers in laboratory animals. & # 34 ; Why ca n't this billion dollar company make us a healthy drink ? Because we make it big profits by buying its unhealthy one.Dumb !	-1
I drink lots of protein shakes and eat protein bars , often just mixing a scoop of vanilla whey with almond milk or even water . It 's tolerable . This is n't . It tastes like raw beans covered in bad chocolate syrup . I was intrigued by the idea of a 100 calorie protein shake with 17 g of protein ( a GREAT ratio ) , unfortunately the taste is so bad it 's not worth it . I could n't even finish it .	-1
I hated both the taste an texture of this . I gave one to someone else to try and he hated it too . Ended up throwing the last two bottle away .	-1
I appreciated all the vitamins it provided but the taste was horrendous . It tasted like metal and chemicals . It was hard to swallow the pills because it left a disqusting aftertaste . If these pills had a better flavor i would repurchase . But they do not .	-1
I chose this supplement because of all the wonderful ingredients , and I think that is all still great . But the resulting pill is huge , not surprising , and I 'm a great pill swallower . I can , and do swallow several pills at a time with no problem . But this one is not only huge , but not well coated , so it got caught in my throat probably 1 out of three times . The aftertaste is just way too herbal , grassy tasting for me . I suspect it is the spuralina . I mostly noticed the taste after the times I had to wrestle up and down my throat a few times to get it to cooperate . I did finish my order and will not reorder . I 'm sad about that , truly I was so hopeful that I had found a great mix of herbal and multivitamins . ( sigh )	-1
Oh my this was bad . Ate it with food and almost immediately felt burning in my stomach . I could n't take it . Also , after 3 days , I ended up with a UTI - I wonder if there was a connection .	-1
They say you do n't feel the heat , but for me it was there loud and strong . Ending up throwing them out .	-1
I have taken this product on and off over the years as a dietary supplement . It was less than $ 4.50 as an add-on item with Amazon which made me try it out again . I noticed that it causes heartburn with or without food . It helps suppress your appetite for sure , and works , but it has health effects that are n't worth the outcome . There are other appetite suppressants out there , therefore I would recommend going with another brand over this one .	-1
I wanted so bad for these to work , but I only took one and I was on fire in two orifices , if you know what I mean .	-1
Saw on the news how this product works . Maybe being sick a day was too late , or maybe dorsnt work on the virus I had . Did n't help at all .	-1
It is just OK I do not like this brand because they come off as if their products are in some pure form and they are not	-1
Compare these two statements from the product descriptions : * '' This species of kelp grows in coastal ocean waters from 1 to 10 feet deep with the tide . `` * '' Kelp is collected from deep in the ocean because Kelp close to shore may absorb many heavy metals and toxins . `` Anybody see a contradiction here ? It does n't say THIS kelp is collected from deep in the ocean - it says just the opposite.In fact , kelp DOES N'T grow `` deep in the ocean '' - it grows ONLY in shallow water up to 250 feet deep . By ocean standards , 250 feet is shallow , and it 's `` close to shore . '' Frankly , I think Nature 's Way does n't know what it 's talking about .	-1
I did n't like this product and it did n't help me will regularity . Just another product down the drain ... would not recommend if you have digestive problem .	-1
If Jack had been able to carry these up the Beanstalk , he could have given them to the Giant , because the Giant is about the only one who could swallow these things . They are HUGE compared to other Calcium Citrate tablets I 've taken with the same dosage . I 'll be going back to my old brand and paying a little more ( Swanson Premium ) because I know about the quality and the size is so much smaller than these HUGE lozenges !	-1
I 've been taking this for about a year . I do take other natural herbs , but my a1c is stable and great . One warning . My urologist gave me a grave warning about having the deep neon colored pee . Your urine should be slightly yellow at best , otherwise you are overworking your kidneys . I am cutting mu dosage in half and drinking more water . I 'm now looking for another brand . I do n't feel like losing a kidney .	-1
My doctor told me to take & # 34 ; digestive enzymes & # 34 ; to help my stomach problems and I 've tried a few over the last year or so . This one , like the others , does n't seem to do anything for me .	-1
This helped the hot flashes for about a week . Then I was searching for something else . The only thing that really works is prescription hormones .	-1
It 's Stacker 3.. unless you 're doing a full regime of stuff you probably wo n't get the full benefit of it . Under regular use I did n't notice much except a slightly elevated heart beat .	-1
I heard mixed reviews on 5-htp saying that it might do something with your heart . I stopped taking it because I did not want to take it too long , thinking it might have a negative side effect . I did not notice much of a difference , but I did definitely have strange dreams while I would be taking it right before bed .	-1
About an hour after taking 1 I had a horrible headache & within another 30 min . I was vomiting . I am afraid to try again because I felt so horrible after taking this . It also did the opposite for me regarding sleep . I tossed & turned all night . Hopefully I can find someone who does better with 5HTP & I can give this bottle to them .	-1
This stuff did n't do NADA for me . I even tried a higher dose ( within safe limits ) but did not notice any change in my sleeping or mild anxiety . I dunno , maybe that 's not what it 's really for ? But that 's the hype I read , so I tried it .	-1
I noticed no effect after taking this , and it is more expansive than other brands of horny goat weed that actually work .	-1
This was the first Echinacea brand that I tried and I was not impressed . It upset my stomach , I could taste the Echinacea in my mouth for hours after taking it , and it did n't seem to have any effect on my symptoms when taking preemptively for the cold flu . I purchased the Jarrow version of Echinacea and it worked MUCH better than this one.Pros- InexpensiveCons- Leaves bad taste in mouth ( literally ) - Even 1 capsule upsets my stomach- Had zero effect when taken preemptively for cold/flu symptomsBottom line : You get what you pay for with this one . Shop around for a better quality Echinacea .	-1
I bought some of the AA Duracell 2650 mAh NiMH batteries and the Duracell 15 minute charger model CEF15NC to use with my digital camera . The batteries do not hold a charge at all . Some of the worst rechargable NiMH batteries I have ever had the displeasure of using . I put the batteries in the charger and after about 15 minutes it indicates the batteries are charged . Put them in the camera and after one or two shots the low battery indicator shows . If I do n't use the freshly charged batteries right away and try to use the camera after a day or two there is absolutely no charge in the batteries . I have tried charging them in other chargers overnight and the same situation . They do not hold a charge . I even bought another set of the Duracell batteries to see if maybe the first set were bad , but the new ones would not hold a charge either .	-1
In the past I 've ordered this same model and got 2500 mAh cells , today my orderarrived with 2300 mAh cells . I guess you ca n't expect Amazon to sell the latestproduct , makes me wonder if they got a deal on some old stock cells.By the way , I paid more for the 2300 's than the 2500's.The 2500 's ( Japan ) are Sanyo made ( about the best ) .The 2300 's are made in China and not as good but O.K .	-1
I bought two 4-packs of `` AA '' rechargeable batteries because I was hoping to save money . I 've successfully recharged the batteries probably eight times . Since then , they no longer hold a charge . One of the eight batteries does not even register in the charger . If the batteries sit on a shelf for a few days , they 're dead . I would avoid these batteries .	-1
The opening on this pill gun is large and the tip is very soft/flimsy so that small pills ( halves or quarters ) are difficult to hold in . There is no resistance at the opening . My vet quartered 1/4 '' round tablets and this barely holds them in . If , God forbid , I touch the tablet ( not push ) with the plunger too soon , it falls out . I consider myself an `` expert '' cat piller ( I 've had friends call me to their houses to give their cats pills ) , however , I now have the first cat I 've had difficulty pilling . This pill gun does not help.I previously tried this with my labrador retriever and had the same issue with pills falling out , although luckily it was much easier to give pills to him , so I kept trying until I succeeded .	-1
This thing is a brute . There is no way to pill them gently when this is just so bulky and huge .	-1
Pads are too high and do n't support the hernia at all , and it does n't offer adequate adjustability . Complete waste of money !	-1
I guess you can say these undies help , but only because they cut the circulation off to your pelvic region making you numb to any sensation what-so-ever.Plus they look completely rediculous ! Looks , however , do not matter when it comes to relieving hernia pain.They did seem to help a little in that department , but only if you pull the straps very tightly .	-1
First use seemed to work well , but that was right behind taking Prevacid . The next time ( a few days later ) it did n't seem to help much . I needed to take tums to finish the job .	-1
I got this product as my sister used the regular version ( the one without the probiotics ) and loved it . I wanted to try it since she had such rave reviews for it and when I saw there was one with probiotics I thought that would be even better . It was n't . The product did nothing and has a sour taste/smell - which the regular version does n't as I tried my sisters and liked .	-1
a friend at work told me how he had benefitted from this sort of product , so I tried this . Didnt seem to help my ( not to serious ) indigestion or heartburn . A couple Rolaids at night makes a lot more difference and are a lot cheaper .	-1
With in the past two weeks of consuming 2 tabs with each meal , the only thing I 've noticed is flatulence comes at an alarming pace and without warning all within an hour of consuming the pills ... on a good note , there is no noticeable smell but the sound can be deafening	-1
This may be a good product . Perhaps I should have found out if I needed probiotics , or even what it is meant for . After a successful trial of Digest Gold , I made the mistake of buying this . First two or three doses seemed to work as well . After those , chronic stomach discomfort . Resorted to Digest Gold only . Lesson : the details matter .	-1
i required it for bloating and it dint absolutely nothing for me and i did not feel a difference waste of money	-1
I did n't notice anything while i was taking this . The reason i purchase this it 's because i have a digestive problem . it did n't work for me .	-1
I bought these to counteract some side effects from another medication I 'm on and I ca n't really say that it helped that much . I ended up having to purchase a different product because I went thought a whole btotle of this at 3x a day and it did n't make any difference . It could be that I need something stronger because my & # 34 ; issues & # 34 ; are due to side effects , but in any case , I wo n't be buying these again .	-1
As soon as I received it , I placed the entire bottle on my stool . Nothing . I had to buy a cushion instead . Very disappointed .	-1
I tried this medication for sometime.. but did n't work good.Waste of money in purchasing this . I tried to use this consistently for 5 days but no results or comforts yields as advertised with the medication	-1
My husband has been using these razors for years . He does not think that this is the authentic product . he thinks that these are a fake . this Raisler does not give the Smooth shave that a real Mach three turbo razor does . I will NOT order this item again from Amazon , it will be best to go to your local market and buy them . my husband is upset to say the least	-1
Hmmmmm the better question is why did I buy comet online ? The answer is because I was depressed and drinking and did not feel like going out but I do n't like dirt . My comet was fine . It did nothing for my depression but I managed to clean the sink .	-1
I 've been using comet many years and have had no problems with it but this comet I got from Amazon smelled so bad I just threw it out . The was something wrong with it . I do not recommend this product and I will never purchase it again on line .	-1
I got this pen to try a & # 34 ; Pinterest project & # 34 ; I wanted to bleach a design into a shirt . I used the pen as instructed , but it did n't bleach the shirt . Normally this would make me happy , but since the whole purpose was to bleach it ... no good !	-1
Like many others , I 'm sure , I purchased Blue Emu after watching countless TV ads with Johnny Bench attesting to its greatness . I have an arthritic shoulder and wanted to try a topical treatment to minimize my usage of oral pain medication.First off , the product arrives in a very small jar . It is odorless as advertised . The instructions tell you to use it twice daily for 2 weeks and then as needed after that . I used it twice daily for over 2 weeks and perceived minimal pain relief from it . The relief was so minimal that I still question how much it was due to the product and how much was simply a placebo effect . I used up the entire jar , which did not take very long , but I would not purchase it again . I 'm baffled by all of the positive reviews for this product . Any long term pain relief after using this product is most likely due to nothing more than passage of time . Based on my experience , you wo n't stink , but you also wo n't have much pain relief from Blue Emu .	-1
this product is so unremarkable that i dont recall why i bought it . i used it recently for a mild athlete foot issue and have not seen a difference . the texture is thin and seems rather watered down IMO but i will use it as a lotion on my dry arms to see if it help with that	-1
not nears as good as australian dream	-1
this product did NOTHING in alleviating my pain or helping me to recover my injury . I am very disappointed and wish I could get a refund !	-1
Great idea and would be great if it worked for me , but it does not . I would highly recommend Freeze It . I use the roll on and it works quickly . About the same price but much better ... .for me that is .	-1
I have occ neck pain and back pain.I tried this and it did nothing . I actually have found better relief with Aspercreme that I bought at RiteAid . I did notice that it works for my daughters eczema , so I gave it to her . Will not purchase for myself again though .	-1
I saw no advantage of these cleaning pads over just the old scotch-bite yellow and green sponges . They fall apart much to easy and there is no advantage in their ability to clean .	-1
Not sure if I 'm using the sponge correctly but this thing sheds like an eraser . It does seem to clean off certain stains but the residue it leaves behind creates additional work to clean up .	-1
I have n't had much luck with this product . It does n't seem to do any better for me then a sponge with a scrubber on it . They do n't last long before they come apart .	-1
The commercials on TV over-sold this product . It does accomplish what it says it will -- about half the time . The other half it either smudges your wall slightly or does n't do anything . I never expected it to get everything ( not going to believe a commercial literally ) , but given the brand , I was hoping for a higher success rate .	-1
This product did not work for me in the least . It was an overpriced sponge that fell apart after one use . Did n't get any stains off or clean the grout . Did n't even clean the sink properly ( I had to use a dish brush to finish the job ) . The only thing this product was good at doing was inducing curses .	-1
Mr. Clean Magic Erasers have always been a mystery to me . I 've tried to use them because I 've heard how useful they are on certain cleaning jobs , but every single time I 've tried to work with them they have either fallen apart and/or did not work at all . I read that they were amazing at cleaning stubborn scuff marks on floors , but I had no luck . These Erasers did nothing for my woodwork , my bathroom faucet , my bicycle , or my husband 's sneakers . I tried both the blue and the white side and was left with a mess of shredded Magic Erasers that had to go in the garbage.In the end I used my eco-friendly re-useable cotton rag withBiokleen All Purpose Cleaner , 32-Ounce Bottles ( Pack of 12 ) . Nothing went in the garbage and my woodwork , floors , bike , bathroom and husband 's sneakers were all magically clean .	-1
I first ordered these in 2009 and they worked GREAT ! . so great that i called the company and they sent me a coupon for a free box ! however , i never ordered them again until last week from staples they had them at a great price.I followed the instructions by wetting the sponge first and then i commenced to cleaning my aunt 's dirty stove and microwave.the sponge started to crumble while i was working on the microwave . i went to the stove top and it split in half and continued to crumble.i would 've been better off using a brillo pad . maybe this is n't for tough jobs .	-1
I saw lots of really nice reviewing comparing to the more expensive toothbrush like sonic care . Let me tell you , the power is no where near a & # 34 ; real & # 34 ; the sonic care . It went into the garbage on the first try .	-1
I use Alli , it seems to work . This product does not work for me , it might for someone else . After using the product I would get a headache . This product is not for me . I will stick with Alli .	-1
I do n't have diabetes , but it runs in my family and I test my glucose weekly or more . I started this product based on Dr Oz . 's TV show recommendation.. I did't lose a pound of the 10 I want to lose . BUT WORSE : MY BLOOD SUGAR ROSE by several points . I can not specifically say this was the culprit . If you are going to try it , just be conscious of your daily blood glucose reading . I also heard recently that Dr Oz said the daily blood sugar monitors are worthless . This concerns me greatly . Every day it seems there is another new breakthrough ... for which possible side effects , including those for a growing number of Type 2 Diabetics , are never mentioned . Buyer beware of ALL Health products with sensational claims .	-1
I nearly finished one bottle of these & they did nothing at all for me except waste my money . On the other hand , I tried CLA and Pyruvate months later & did lose 5lbs . within a few weeks .	-1
Tried this following instructions exactly , and see no evidence it 's working . Do n't fall for it . It 's a waste of money .	-1
I bought this with high hopes for using it on an upcoming 18 day trip where I will eat food that might have carbs in it.I tested it by eating a prepared serving of grits ( 1/4 cup = 32 grams of carbs ) . I took the Carb Blocker ( 2 ) just before eating the grits.My blood sugar just before eating ( fasting ) was 79 . After 30 minutes , I had a spike to 126 ! I had planned to take more blood sugar readings but did n't think it was necessary . I had hoped to see a small spike in glucose followed by a long decay but this was a ridiculous result . My last test I did to test carb tolerance gave similar results ( no Carb Block 2 taken ) so it would appear that Carb Blocker 2 had NO effect.I remember when the first carb blockers came out decades ago and were universally panned by scientists - I had hoped that this new version ( 2 ) was better but there 's nothing here . Once again , they do nothing .	-1
I tried this product last year , with high hopes . Carbs are my downfall . I cut back on calories while taking Carb Intercept and followed the instructions carefully . After finishing an entire package , I lost 1 pound . I am at an age ( 52 ) where losing weight is getting more difficult , but i did expect to lose a few pounds . I did not have any side effects at all while taking this , however , which is why I gave it 2 stars .	-1
I exercise daily , and I finished the entire bottle . I saw no change in my weight fluctuations . My bodyweight was basically reacting the same as it did before I took these . It seems the mode of action of these pills is to block a type of amylase which breaks down carbohydrates . Well , your body can produce more than one type of enzyme to break them down . Another thing to note here is the fact that all the 5 star reviews are people who have only reviewed THIS item , which makes me question either the integrity of the seller and/or the manufacturer of this product .	-1
I think I actually GAINED weight ! Best bet is the South Beach Diet then you do n't have to worry about carbs at all . These made me feel very bloated .	-1
Be careful if you are sensitive to caffiene . I used these for 2 days . I did not sleep either night . And I took them before lunch . I bought mine at GNC and returned them today . I also felt very bloated when I used them , as if I had not taken them . This is how I feel when I carb load . My heart was racing and headache was soooo bad ! So they did not work for me . I know not all products work the same for everyone . But I would not recommend these to anyone with a caffiene sensitivity .	-1
I am not impressed with the results from taking this . I think there are too many high scoring reviews , which is usually the case on Amazon .	-1
I did n't feel this product did anything to help me lose weight . I noticed no difference at all from when I was using it v. not using it .	-1
You will most likely have it if you consume more than 2 tablespoons of this a day . That is usually what I have with my tea and I have it twice a day . I had this experience for 4-5 days straight before realizing this was the cause . There is even a warning on the back that says over consumption can have this effect . If 2 tablespoons is considered over consumption that is a bit ridiculous .	-1
Be aware that some people can have gastric problems with xylitol , as it is not digested ( hence the lower calories ) . Well , I 'm one of those people ! Nothing severe but ca n't eat baked goods made with xylitol while in the company of others , if you know what I mean .	-1
I 'm sure this product is completely fine , but out of principle we could not accept corn based , or China based products in any way , shape , or form . Our two shipments of this particular product were just fine , quality looks fine . But , going forward we are compelled to get only USA based , Birch based Xylitol . This may not even be logical , but there you have it.By the way , ants ( and probably all bugs ) ignore Xylitol , which is another minor plus .	-1
I used this once to sweeten my homemade toothpaste . I ca n't use this stuff as a food product , my system just does n't like it . ( Like your 94 year old , lactose intolerant great uncle just ate all the creme fraiche in France ... yikes ! ) I swear , I ran the cat off ! It works well as a toothpaste sweetner , but I could never use it for anything else and have since stopped using it at all .My one star rating is aimed at the product and my results after use . It has nothing to do with Now Foods as a company . But for the sake of humanity and global climate change ... . I wo n't ever use this again !	-1
I only received 1 not a pair , its basically a piece of plastic , save your money this is a waste	-1
This stuff is horrible . Followed instructions with suggested dosage , gave it to the cat , cat got sick and threw up , and lost her appetite.Even wrapped in a pill pocket , I ca n't get her to take it . She accidentally bit into in , made a horrible face , and now she wo n't take any of her pills because she does n't trust the pill pockets .	-1
I gave this to my 70lb dog twice a day for two weeks and it did not stop itching . Not sure if it helps humans but definitely did not help my dog .	-1
Bought this for our american bulldogs allergies but they didny work well for him . We 'll stick to Benadryl .	-1
My dog is allergic to the world , I picked these up to help . They did n't do anything . Not even when I was giving him six per the docs recommendations . I 'll stick to benadryl .	-1
Product was not what was expected as it arrived broken and looked used . It was a gift and the person is going to purchase locally .	-1
Does not do what it should . No suction , and is very flimsey product . Waste of time and money . Ca n't recommend	-1
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ! I think that says it all . This item was the worst thing I 've purchased on Amazon ! I saw it or something similar advertised on TV and thought , why not , Amazon has n't steered me wrong in the past ; well , there 's always a first time ! They should remove this product from their website and cancel all orders ! It does n't do what they advertise NOR does it really seem to do anything but HUM , loudly ! I threw it out it was so bad !	-1
Buying anything on TV can be a very dicey proposition . You might get something that works , you might not . But rest assured folks out there in TV land , THIS PRODUCT ABSOLUTELY , POSITIVELY DOES NOT WORK ! ! ! It 's a total piece of cheap Chinese plastic junk , without any possibility of cleaning your ears , or anything else for that matter . Do what I do to clean your ears -- simply place a couple drops of hydrogen pyroxide in each ear , then carefully clean the edges of the ear canal , or in cases of severe wax buildup , every year or so go to an Ear , Nose and Throat doc and get them vacumned out properly . Quick , painless , and thorough.But wait ! ! ! I just told you the `` Good News '' about this pile of junk . It took this bogus TV company THREE MONTHS TO FINALLY GET ME THE USELESS PRODUCT ! ! ! They sent it to the wrong address TWO TIMES , finally getting it right on the third attempt . Not only did this worthless piece of crap not work at all , but their `` customer service '' was even worse ! ! ! The only reason I did n't give this thing ZERO STARS is because you have to leave at least one .	-1
I expect this product is very good , but it comes in a glass bottle . It was sent via the U.S.P.S . and arrived smashed , even tho it was bubble wrapped and in a box withseveral other bubble wrapped items .	-1
An article I read suggested crushing the tablet between two nested teaspoons and drinking the powder mixed in water or juice . That turns sustained release into quick release and sustained hour or longer flush into a 10 or 15 minute flush of no greater intensity than the hour flush.I upped the dosage of whole tablets too fast and found that what had been a mildly irritating flush turned into an excruciating hour of a beet red heated face and body , and prickly itching all over . So , my advice is to 1 ) crush these tablets or use regular niacin , and 2 ) increase dosage slowly over a period of weeks.UPDATE 7/24/11 The latest research shows NO reduced heart attack rate from taking niacin for people at high heart attack risk , AND an increased chance of stroke . Combining those results with niacin stressing the liver , I decided to discontinue supplementing with high does of niacin . No more flush and 4 fewer pills a day and less chance of stroke or severe liver disease ... it seems like a no brainer to me . You can google `` NHLBI NIH AIM-HIGH study '' for a fairly technical discussion of the study . Google `` niacin study stopped early '' for different news service reports .	-1
Vitamin C has to be in a complex . This is not real C. Of course , most products on the market are not real C. These companies should not be selling this !	-1
A friend of mine let me try this . I could n't finish it because of the vile taste.After doing some research I was surprised to learn that most of our synthetic vitamins are coming from China . . . That is , at least 80 % . Chances are , this is from China too . And the most popular form of synthetic vitamin C is ascorbic acid . Naturally occurring vitamin C is the same molecule as synthetic ascorbic acid . But in food , ascorbic acid is found within the vitamin C complex among other compounds . The ascorbic acid in supplements is often derived from corn starch , corn syrup , or rice starch , and is chemically dependent upon volatile acids.I bought some Pure Radiance powder and it is worth every penny .	-1
I make my own facial serums and this product does not work for that like others recommend.I used a coffee grinder and it was still gritty ... OK for mixing in juice though !	-1
I do not know how long should I take it to see result ? My period is more heavy than before after using this and also bad cramps	-1
I am not sure where to put this product . As a woman I need calcium and I heard that magnesium is just as important . So I got this product in January and started taking it as a daily supplement . A week later my hair just started to fall like crazy . I do n't want to say that it was from this particular product but everything points to it . About two weeks ago , it is now May , I stopped taking it and my hair just stopped falling that bad . It still not so good when I wash my hair but do n't lose as much strands as I did while I was taking it . I also researched on calcium overdose and calcium/magnesium imbalance can cause hair fall , so now I am just convinced that this product has a lot to do with it . I will not be taking this product or at least not on a daily basis .	-1
That it 's powder is good , but this time this product is not helping my fingernails as another one did earlier . I 'm wondering about strength of it . It does taste up milk a bit ( odd ) . I put it in a juice with diluted water . I 'll try another product soon as I just waned it for strong fingernails .	-1
If you have tooth and bone mineral loss , take this but must also take vit D , A , along with MK4 ( from Thorne ) . You will need to experiment , as these vitamins will cause you to store up the calcium more efficiently thus might need to take more.update 07/11/2013 : Originally i gave it 5 stars but I regret having to lower it . If you want to increase blood calcium i think you can use product short term . But for bone mineral density and tooth health i do n't recommend it . I had used it ( normally taking the effective dose of 2000-3000 mg - sometimes more ) through my breastfeeding period for over a year , but eventually my teeth began crumbling and my baby 's . But i was deceived it was working good because it really helped with other bone pains , except my teeth . However i was also aware that my blood calcium level must be high -- which is not good.Then when i had excruciating pain about two weeks ago , the dentist recommended root canal because of a tooth infection , in addition to having several cavities , i just could not go through that procedure because of the breastfeeding demands ( i knew by experience from the year previous ) .I did not do any surgery . I immediately changed my diet to include 32 ounces of yogurt ( Brown Cow brand ) , with organic milk and/or raw milk and took a one time double dose of Bone building supplement from wholefoods . And this halted the excruciating pains and began the reversal . My baby 's teeth are turning whiter ! And it looks like the the teeth where she lost enamel there is a white glossing over the dentin ! The problem was that i was missing the phosphorus ! ! This is what i am taking : Fermented cod liver oil several times a day , high vitamin butter oil , up to 15000 of vitamin D gelcaps . Dehydrated liver supplements . With the newly added : daily dairy , eating fish almost daily , andJarrow Formulas Lactoferrin 250mg , 60 Capsules . And a couple of times a week , bone broth from korean restaurants called sullungtang , which should help.For those looking for a supplement i recommendJarrow Formulas Bone-Up , 240 Capsules , based on calve bones from the pastures of new Zealand , which i am considering taking , because the diet only route recommended inCure Tooth Decay : Heal and Prevent Cavities with Nutrition , 2nd Editioncan get very expensive.Currently there is no pain when not eating or brushing , sensitivity to cold/hot , sweet , but greatly diminished . Chewing pain has greatly reduced.update 10/21/2013 - do not take such high vitamin d dosages . Eventually my teeth started to hurt again and discovered that reducing vitamin d helped , and settled to 4000 iu per day -- i am breastfeeding . Once my period started my teeth began acting up again , and for this upping the magnesium helped , and also copper especially when taking zinc .	-1
First , a big thank you to Amazon for providing this forum . I am grateful for this.Bought this without looking to make sure it was gmo free . Bought NOW gmo-free lecithin -- EXCELLENT product . ( had to request that the Co-op store order gmo-free lecithin ) Bought NOW gmo-free xylitol and have just re-ordered . Great product . Not only is this powder not gmo-free , it seems to be `` hiding gmo content '' because it is a calcium-mg. supp . It has a surprise -- soy-derivative on the label . The supp . is not listed in NOW 'S `` COMPLETE LIST OF GMO-FREE PRODUCTS '' on NOW 's website . It has this dorky rating from some rating organization , which they proudly display . Its a `` GMP '' seal ( not finding a gmo free indication saying otherwise , I thought it was for `` genetically modified product '' at first when it got here ) . I forgot to include this product with my other order I made the same evening , paying by mistake for standard shipping . This product is going back in the mail , still sealed . The soy or its possible infusion with herbicide may be why some are having problems with loose stools . The rest of the formula for this powder is `` to die for '' , I think . I 'm a 66 old lady ( ha ha ) , still trying to exercise regularly , and have felt that mg. in the past has helped leg pain after . Now I need calcium also to combat a tired back , and hoped to get everything I need in a powder . Think again . Already have large capsules ( triple OOO 's ) if it wo n't dissolve . Really thought that it would NOT be gmo , like so many other of their great products . Would n't be so grumpy -- -if we were not trying to volunteer to get the labeling initiative passed here in the golden state so gave it 2 for trying , and because it was bargain priced , instead of 1 star -- LOL ( No bargain )	-1
did not notice a thing and i would up the doses too . the ingredients are there but the amount is not . i would look to other cognitive enhancers like Brain Elevate	-1
The powder was so fine that it made my whole family cough uncontrollably while trying to eat our popcorn . I only used about a tablespoon for a very large bowl of popcorn , so nothing crazy . I 'm sure this product would be fine if you 're mixing it into something wet and not sprinkling it onto dry popcorn , but we will not be buying this again . I prefer the texture and taste of the Kal flakes .	-1
I tried it in several foods . It just was n't for me . I gave it to my daughter who is a health nut . I suggest someone to make it known that it is a strong taste that if you do n't like it you will not use it .	-1
No significant change noticed in my health so I stopped taking them after a month . The burp tastes like spirulina long after taking it so try taking it before food .	-1
They stink . Had to throw away the bottle . The odor of the pills was awful . Turned my stomach I couldnt swallow them .	-1
I had done a little research and chose to order this because of it 's supposed effects on veins ... namely making them less visable . I only took it for a week , but noticed I was really dizzy..looked up the supplement again and noticed dizziness was a side effect and one website..a reputible medical one suggested No One should take this ... yikes..will not use .	-1
I 've heard and read that this stuff is supposed to have such a strong smell that it will make your eyes sting . The stuff in the bottle I received barely smelled like peppermint at all , and that was directly from the just opened bottle.I placed several drops in several areas around my basement and the smell was gone the following day.Maybe there are different kinds of `` 100 % peppermint oil '' and this version is some kind of low odor version ? All I know is it was n't what I expected or wanted and I 'll choose a different brand when ordering a replacement.After receiving this disappointing product I took a closer look at the mostly 5-star reviews . It appears that most of the negative reviews have occurred recently and mention the same issues I did . This makes me wonder if NOW Foods has either had a quality control issue or is simply using a cheaper product to increase profits . Either way , after doing this additional research I 'm pretty sure my next bottle will be coming from a different supplier.To make this experience even more frustrating , Amazon has classified this as a hazardous substance and refuses to accept returns for it .	-1
Despite whatever claims are made about this product being 100 % pure , they are false . I grew up using peppermint oil and this is NOT pure what so ever . I have to use far more of this diluted product to get the same results , making the good price of this oil useless . Note : I use peppermint oil for natural health remedies by applying it to the skin and combining it with other oils and products . I recommend doterra , they are more expensive but worth it .	-1
Smells good but you can immediately tell that its not very strong which is really what is effective against mice . I have purchased Peppermint oil from Whole Foods and a little bit went a long way . I needed to use a lot more of this product and it did nothing to get rid of the mice . Save your money . Their is a reason why this is low in price .	-1
While this is a decent EO , I do n't appreciate the tricky wording in their advertising or packaging . & # 34 ; Natural & # 34 ; does not mean that it is good for you . NOW Foods uses GMOs in their products , and I did n't find out until after I ordered this . Whether they use it in this exact product makes no difference to me . I refuse to support any company that does , and does not label their products as such . Just Google & # 34 ; NOW Foods uses GMOs & # 34 ; . Boo on you NOW , boo on you .	-1
I 've used this brand of peppermint oil for a couple yrs and it was wonderful . The last 2 bottles I got -- including the one I ordered through amazon was HORRIBLE ! ( no fault of amazon or the shipper -- great service there , as always ! ) I talked to the NOW people , first customer service , then the Nutrition Dept . They told me they have 4 different sources , all in India , for their peppermint . They only require 50 % menthol in the product ( which is what gives peppermint its characteristic fragrance ) . The previous bottles smelled so sweet you 'd want to eat them and could use them to flavor foods , icing , etc . These last bottles have an awful rank odor over the comparatively faint peppermint smell . There 's no way I could use this stuff ! NOW seemed rather ambivalent about it ( & # 34 ; oh , we 've had several complaints/comments like yours & # 34 ; ) but did n't seem willing to change anything ! I 'm looking for a new source of peppermint oil .	-1
On researching how to get rid of mice , there was this item alongside which was an ad for peppermint oil that said , get rid of mice the humane way . Just dab a few drops of peppermint oil on a cotton ball and leave them in troublesome places . It did nothing and the mouse is still around . I believe this information is false and should be removed . I never would have purchased the peppermint oil had I known it was false advertising .	-1
Before putting peppermint oil around the kitchen , we were catching about a mouse a week with thed-CON 00027 Ultra Set Covered Mouse Trap . Since putting pads soaked in peppermint oil in strategic locations , we have continued to catch about a mouse a week.Two stars rather than one because it smelled nice .	-1
I started my journey with Tomco chunks ( still have them ) , moved on to Peppermint oil ( still have lots ) and ultrasonic repellents , then on to Just One Bite chunks ( still have these , too ) . Nothing ! NOTHING works . I removed , disinfected , stored , contained , hunted , chased , filled holes , baited , and cleaned until I 'm completely exhausted . It 's been 4 months and the mice are still winning . I have since moved on to a couple of natural methods and they are showing cautiously limited success , but more than the previous attempts .	-1
First of all , this came and the shipper left it in the wrong location . It was at a door that is never used . So it sat outside in 12 degree weather for a day and a half . At least it was n't frozen.Then I looked at the bottle and they have a big sticky barcode label over the NOW name , picture and the product . This is so inconsiderate of them . I had planned to return it , but then I found that I might be able to work at it and peal little bits and parts off so I could at least see the label . It 's off now but the bottle is really sticky . I will use it like that now . The bottle should never be covered up like that . How can you tell what 's in it ? AND what is ? ? ? Usually Peppermint Oil is so STRONG it stings your noise and makes your eyes water a bit . This does n't ! There is not much smell to it at all . Was it watered down ? ? ? Maybe they put that big label on the little bottle so you would not know it was supposed to be Peppermint Oil !	-1
so after recently discovering i had mice problem i read about peppermint oil . i placed about 30 sticky traps through my basement . caught 2 mice very next day.. than for almost two weeks no mice . I figured i had caught them than put out two bottle of oil and put those wick sticks inside them . whole basement smelled like double mint gum factory . I actually like the smell . so this was on saturday i put it out . i put on in closet that is unfunished where i can see the beams and rafter have my traps . Monday morning I go to check traps.. and 4 mice caught w/ bottle of oil a few 3ft away ! ! i feel like this attracted them more than deterred them . anyway , while i like the smell and recommend it to freshen up your house dont expect help w/ mice .	-1
Not sure this works at keeping mice away . I really wanted it to but it does n't seem to . Fresh droppings right next to the cotton ball soaked in the peppermint oil . Make house smell overbearing but would n't have minded if it really worked .	-1
Had bought my first peppermint EO in a small bottle made by another manufacturer . Loved it and went through it very rapidly . Thought I would try this brand because it was a far bigger bottle and priced much cheaper comparatively . As my dear sweet mama use to say , & # 34 ; you get what you pay for. & # 34 ; Smells rancid . strongly recommend you do not buy .	-1
I do n't know whether jojoba oil should smell like fish . The one i got sure does . May be it 's too old ? I smelled a few jojoba oils in the vitamine shoppe when I was there last time , all of those had a pleasant smell ( or no smell at all ) . This one is strange , I am not sure I will keep using it .	-1
I bought this because Dr Oz said that the best thing for rough hands is Jojoba Oil , but this one has a horrible smell .	-1
I notice some improvement at the first hour . Then I became having stomach cramps and spent the night hugging the toilet.Thought I was going to die . The next day I tried the mix again and the same thing happen . The second time whenI notice there was bad taste to the mix . I have severe stomach aches ( 24 hours ) for the whole week . I think I got it out of my system now . What I was vomiting was the white mix so I just have to associate it with this product .	-1
I started using these over a month ago , and I also have n't noticed any difference whatsoever . I also added NOW Foods Super Enzymes with these with meals - also no noticeable difference . I am a 38 year old male , have no gall bladder and have had pancreatic insufficiency for over 8 years , so I thought either or both of these supplements would help . Pretty disappointed .	-1
I have had better experience wit other brands like Systane gel or Genteal ointment . But final conclusion os is really depending on the reason of dry eyes ... . It seems that drops are not my favorites even from the aforementioned brandsHowever this has a glass container which is nice , the others are plastic containers !	-1
Wish I could give this zero stars . This is a homeopathic product . If you do n't know what that means look it up . There 's nothing useful in it and they do give you a clue to that affect where they say it `` contains no harsh chemicals '' . I did n't catch this little detail when I ordered it . Probaby the biggest scam of the modern era . And people keep buying this stuff !	-1
I have `` regular '' dry eyes from cold weather and lots of computer work . I normally use TheraTears , but I wanted to try the Similasan homeopathic product.The drops irritated my eyes ; they actually felt drier post-drops . I tried it at different times of day to see if that made a difference . It did n't matter , every time I had the same negative experience . The reaction surprised me . I figured as a homeopathic product it would either help or have no effect . I did n't think it would make the symptoms worse.The dropper style worked fine . It 's different than a regular eyedrop bottle , but it was easy to use.Note : The product expires 30 days after the bottle is opened . Even if you do like the product , that is a really short use by period .	-1
It seems to work but buyer beware . The label on the drops says `` Discard after 30 days '' . See picture I posted . I called the company . Apparently it contain a preservative that 's only guaranteed contaminate free for 30 days .	-1
The bottle I got had a sticker over the lot numbers so I could n't tell if the bottle I got was one that would cause kidney failure . I checked Amazon , the website , etc. , and could n't identify the lot number . I wound up throwing the bottle out , because it was n't worth the risk . Now I 'm buying a different brand .	-1
I used this for 3 mos , no results , just added calorie in the form of sunflower oil ! I will not use this product agian	-1
this product has not been effective for me . I can tell absolutely no differance in hunger . I do feel jitters when taking the product . This pill is like so many other products that I have in my medicine cabinet that promises hope for weight loss , but produces none .	-1
After seeing Dr. Oz recommend collagen , I 've been looking at brands to find a good one . This product apparently causes skin problems in some people.I think it could be due to the collagen source this company uses . It makes sense to me that the growth hormones that are commonly given cows ends up in the connective tissue that is used in collagen products . If you do research , other sites have a lot of reviews about getting acne from this . They also get cysts.Growth hormone usage causes too much testosterone . This can cause acne and skin growths . This is why I look at brands and only buy the best quality from a very reputable company . They do the research and pick the top quality source for their products .	-1
My mom has n't seen any diffrence from taking these and I have two words of warning for you . Horse Pill . If you have a hard time taking large pills this item is not for you .	-1
I bought this because it was recommended as effective treatment for skin tags . It did nothing to remove or reduce the size of my two skin tags . It did make me smell like a pine forest though.Additionally , folks at the American Cancer Society say Thuja can do bad things to your health , so I quit using it after a couple weeks and tossed it .	-1
I took this for about a day and then did some additional research . This form of lithium is much harder to remove from your system than others by the kidneys . I really do n't recommend ever self-medicating , but thought this was harmless ... not so much . I recommend doing a lot of research before using this .	-1
Am dealing with constipation issues ( have a good diet ) and tried this product because of the many good reviews on amazon and bodybuilding forums . However , this product did n't do anything for me . Just made me VERY THIRSTY.. i already drink 1gal a day when i use this product ( about half way threw will continue to use on empty stomach until i finish box ) but when i use this product have to at least drink 1.5 gal to feel satisfied .	-1
I bought this product based upon all the glowing reviews . I 'd hoped that it would help with my GERD condition which , after many years , barely responds to prescription medication ( I 've tried them all ) . After a month 's use the condition is unchanged , the Jarrow has had no affect on my lower GI , as my bowel movements are the same , and I certainly do not feel any more energy . I will continue to finish off the box and , if my conditions change , I will revise my rating.I do not doubt the favorable reviews but , based upon my experience , this product is not a cure-all ( or a cure-everyone ) .	-1
I tried this for a month and all that it caused was much more volume of defecation , and so much runnier . I will be looking for another brand .	-1
The awesome reviews and product description make this look like the best probiotics ever made ! I 've been taking it for a 4 weeks now and I notice no change at all . My constipation is horrible and the only probiotic that has ever worked was the `` Probiotic Pearls IC '' ( not the regular pearls ) . They completely made me regular in about 2 weeks and I was hoping these would be better because of the increased bacteria count and cheaper price . Buying these was a complete waste of money and the shipment arrived very hot and not packaged well . I wo n't buy this product again .	-1
I have taking probiotics before , with great results . Unfortunately , that was not the case with this product . It caused horrible constipation , stomach cramps , and symptoms very close to a UTI ( do n't know how it managed the last one , but they symptoms started when I started taking it and stopped when I stopped ) . I do n't know if I got a bad batch or what , but I feel like I have been poisoned.Update : I was thinking that , possibly , I was just overly sensitive . However , my husband started to take them at the same time as I did and now is feeling very ill , too . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !	-1
Despite taking these along with anti biotic Keflex I still developed a bad yeast infection . These are only 5 billion which is nothing . You can take a few it says , but still weak . I had no improvement in my IBS symptoms or chronic constipation.after getting the yeast over growth , I switched to Ultimate Flora Renew Life ( vaginal support ) 50 billion per capsule . Noticeable difference . no longer needed to take laxatives and stool softeners , go to the bathroom naturally.would not recommend this pro biotic as it did nothing for me .	-1
I 'm sure this product is fine and dandy for most people , but I got it today and it says DO NOT take if you are allergic to bee stings . I have no idea why that would be , but lucky for me , I 'm one of those people who are allergic to bees , so I will be returning this . This is not mentioned ANYWHERE on the item page description .	-1
To be fair i never tried i just did not like the ingredients if i am taking supplements i like to go for more natural ingredients not fillers	-1
Got bad allergies from this , was disappointed , really wanted to take , I suffer severe allergies , probably a good product for others , do n't know . Did n't try to send back since opened .	-1
Made me so nervous and jittery . Must have something in it I am allergic to . Probably okay for most just not for me .	-1
Disappointing that this did nothing for me . Glad it worked for others .	-1
I did n't see much of an improvement when using this by itself . I have been using it at least 4 times a day since June ( maybe I used it too much ? ) It was only when I started using it with vaseline and castor oil did I notice that my burn mark fading . I was told to buy the Now Foods brand of rosehip seed oil . I guess i will try that one when this bottle is finished .	-1
This product has little effect on me . It may work for other people . So I will not buy it again . Actually I find many similar products in my local grocery store that work as wonders .	-1
I 've used NOW brand Papaya Enzymes successfully for years . The added chlorophyll and high ratings prompted me to try this brand , however unfortunately for me the product made me incredibly bloated and gave me insane gas . Product also includes corn starch and magnesium sterate , as an FYI , which are both difficult for me to digest .	-1
Taste good , but did n't help with gas . I have found that Yakult once a day and Schiff & # 34 ; Digestive Advantage & # 34 ; works the best for me .	-1
Not for me . Put to much stress on my kidneys .	-1
After doing more research I have found this to have many unsubstantiated claims . Really wish I had n't wasted the money .	-1
Mag07 works like a charm but I got an allergic reaction from it . Within 4 nights of taking it at night , I noticed a few itchy red bumps on my skin . Within days the bumps multiplied and now I have over 20 red inflamed bumps on my chest that are spreading to my face . I made an appointment with my doctor and will never use this product again . If you notice any itching at all when you start using this product , do yourself a favor and STOP !	-1
Well , I 've never tried other Brewer 's Yeast before ... this was my first time purchasing it , so I did n't really know what to expect . I put it in my smoothies and yeah - I completely agree with the other reviews . It tastes pretty bad . Like ... nutty cardboard.But I found a few tricks : if you put some peanut butter in your smoothie , it kind of masks the taste . Also , if you bake it into chocolate chip , oatmeal , or peanut butter cookies in small quantities , you ca n't taste it at all .	-1
I was really hoping this would help me relax but it did n't help me do anything other than get annoyed . Oh well .	-1
I started getting side effects from prescription anxiety medication , so I decided after about 15 years of being on low-dose of various prescription medications to give something else a try . Like other reviewers , I did feel a mood lift several hours after taking it . I took two a day - one in the morning and one at night . However , I started to have headaches start creeping up within a few days . They felt like headaches I had before I cut caffeine out of my diet ... and I looked over the ingredients again . This contains caffeine . I was SO disappointed . I am extremely sensitive to caffeine , and it triggers cluster headaches for me . Plus , if we 're trying to be all natural here , I know caffeine IS naturally occuring , but it 's still a drug . If they developed a formula without caffeine , I would try it again in a heartbeat !	-1
This item was not at all what I had hoped for and had no effect other than it seemed to effect my mood negatively so I quit taking it after a couple weeks . I would not buy it again .	-1
When i take this vitamin i got stomachache all the times and i do n't have any good effect from this product yet so i will trash this i usally take gaia eye vitamin i think that is much better than this	-1
This product is one of the latest reported to help male problems . For me , it caused nightmares/odd dreams . It could be that it does n't mix well with another supplement that I 'm using .	-1
Does it work ? Who knows - you just cross your fingers . Probably does not - I noticed no difference at all . I 've had no noticeable benefit from the liquid form either , though it actually tastes pretty good diluted with MIO .	-1
The World Health Organization 's International Agency for Research on Cancer and the National Research Council of the United States both have determined that carrageenan is a carcinogen - a substance that causes cancer .	-1
I bought this product ( because it was cheaper than the product that I normally use ) thinking that it was a true gel . IT IS NOT ! ! It is only aloe juice with a gelatin thickener added to it . The consistency is part clumpy part watery mess . I bought it for my hair and it is not suitable for that use . Any TRUE aloe GEL should be suitable for use on skin or hair and this you can not use on either without it running down you face or off your body into a puddle . NEXT TIME I will stick to the product that I normally use.Fruit of the Earth 100 % Aloe Vera 12 oz . Gel	-1
I was using Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera gel for my hair and skin and liked how my curly hair was de-frizzed . However , I was looking for an organic product with a lot less chemicals when I came across Lily of the Desert AV gel . I should have read the reviews about the watery consistency , the inclusion of mixed reviews on carrageenan ( to make it a gel ) , and the need to refrigerate the product . It 's just not suitable for a hair gel . Who wants to run to the refrigerator , bring your bottle to the bathroom , and return it to the refrigerator when you are done .	-1
I bought this originally hoping to use it both for topical use as well as a dietary supplement . That was until I did research on the ingredient of Carageenan . DO NOT EAT THIS STUFF . It is used in this product to make it a gel . If you are planning on using it as a dietary supplement buy the Aloe juice instead of the gel as it does not have this ingredient . I wo n't go into great detail but if you google & # 34 ; dangers of carageenan & # 34 ; you will find exactly what I 'm referring to .	-1
I tried this product twice ( the second time the company gave me a free one ) and both times I found that it smelled like burnt rubber and it definitely did n't taste good . I finished it because I paid for it but will not order again .	-1
This deodorant is nice because it does n't have any fragrance , and is good on sensitive or irritated skin , but it just does n't keep my dry , even in cooler weather . I only use it when I want to be sure I wo n't stain my shirt .	-1
My husband and I were looking for natural alternatives as far as deodorant . He tried this for several days and it diid not help so he switched back to his regular one . If you are not doing any yard work , working out and just lazing around at home , this product will work .	-1
Be Warned , you will only receive one . It 's fine , as far as deodorant goes , but it is not three .	-1
I bought this trying to find a more natural , yet effective deodorant ... I work in a laid-back job , where I can more or less move at my own pace-I am on my feet most the day , but barely moving around ... This deodorant works for about an hour , and then stops . I could notice myself stinking . And like has been said , it wo n't work at all unless applied to PERFECTLY CLEAN skin , i.e . right out of shower and dried skin . Waste of money .	-1
I am getting a little frustrated in my search for natural deodorants -- I have done Toms of Maine and Arm and Hammer - I have tried all deodorant stones they did n't work at all -- I have done this deodorant spray and it did n't work at all -- -- I am very disappointed with this product -- My search will continue -- You put it on and right away I have a body odor -- I take a shower and put this on and failed to work -- do n't waste your money -- any ideas I am still looking for something to actually work --	-1
Very weak and loud , not worth the cost of c batteries ! I have a slimline vibe from Doc Johnson that takes AA batteries and is much stronger	-1
Valerian root only works when it 's `` fresh '' root . The capsule version is dried and does n't capture the essential compounds that make true valerian work . Save your money .	-1
As someone who is a night owl and has a hard time maintaining a good sleeping schedule , I was really looking forward to these . I did some research on valerian root and people had great things to say about it . I also read that there 's no such thing as taking too much of this because it 's all natural.These smell really , really bad , but if you know anything about valerian root , you know that 's to be expected . If you keep your nose closed or breathe through your mouth when taking them , you wo n't really smell them.I took these only once and they did not work for me . I took 4 at first and 45 minutes later I was n't feeling anything . I then took some more - still nothing an hour after that . Took some more , still nothing . I did this about 4 times with absolutely no effects . The next day , however , I had a major headache all day and felt like throwing up.These may work for some , but definitely not for me .	-1
Usually Valerian knocks me out , but the bottle I received smelled horrible and had no effect on me whatsoever . I must have gotten an ineffective or old batch , because no supplement I have received has ever smelled so horrible . It was so bad it made my entire purse reek when I had the unopened bottle in there ! I have used Nature 's Way before to good results , so I am assuming I just had a bad batch .	-1
it smells awful not possible to take , I do n't recommend this pill at all , mine was so bad could have not imagined .wont buy ever again .	-1
I bought these with high expectations after reading a lot of reviews online . They just did not work for me in the way i thought they would . I barely noticed anything after taking the recommended dose of 3 capsules- which I feel is a lot in itself . After taking a second dose of 3 more capsules I did experience a mild to moderate sensation of relaxation in my body . But the effect was not significant enough to make buying these a viable option , esp . considering I had to take so many of them to feel something . Will not buy again	-1
hard too beleavt it doe any penefets at all , headack , stomochach and much more dont bay it , dont waste your mony	-1
If you look at the ingredients : Dextrose , whey protein concentrate , maltodextrin , fructose , sucrose , citric acid , natural flavors , magnesium carbonate , vitamin e acetate , ascorbic acid ( vitamin c ) , l-glutamine , salt , soy lecithin , monopotassium phosphate , yellow 5 and blue 1.You 'll see that you have protein along with dextrose ( sugar but this is a good form of it for recovery drinks ) , maltodextrin ( derived from corn so this is where you get your carbs ) fructose ( sugar , found to be a poor sugar in studies in a recovery drink due to some possible side effects but better than some alternatives ) , sucrose ( sugar ) citric acid ( preservative ) natural flavors ( fine ) you only have one amino acid ( l-glutamine , but this is needed after an extensive workout ) salt , soy ... .the worse part is yellow 5 and blue 1 . Just leave the artificial dyes out . Either do n't dye it at all , or buy a natural food coloring of which there are plenty on the market . soy lecithin is a very cheap emulsifier that is derived mechanically or chemically from soybeans but is simply a by-product of soy oil production -- -but it also contains choline.There is n't much in here you could n't get from eating a bit of cupcake icing after a workout . Squirt some artificial food coloring in cupcake icing and you have a cheaper alternative in my opinion . Yes , you do need a shot of sugar to deliver recovery nutrients to your muscles but this has poor forms of it and you are n't delivering really anything but dyes , salt , and soy to your muscles along with it . If you want whey protein , just put some sugar in it , take L-glutamine in a pill , and eliminate the artificial color and the cheaper sugar forms and you are still way ahead in price and health.No creatine for muscle building either.I think it may be trying to copy the P90X results and recovery formula but with cheaper and less effective ingredients ... I am just guessing there ... and no I have no correlation to that recovery formula , I 've just been studying recovery formulas lately and comparing them and I '' m fairly shocked at the processed and artificial ingredients in several . I think when it comes to things like this the public tends to read the description more than the ingredients because most do n't know what they are anyway.So it 's best to be informed .	-1
I ordered this because I wanted Magnesium Citrate in a smaller 250 mg dose . Two capsules makes 500 mg.Unfortunately , my system does not like magnesium in this form . I experienced multiple side effects that lasted exactly 24 hours . Weird . I was disappointed .	-1
I had been taking magnesium chloride tablets for 6 months but wanted to try a capsule ( as I have trouble swallowing tablets ) . After reviewing the different types , I chose & # 34 ; Magnesium Complex & # 34 ; which contains Magnesium Citrate/Oxide ) . After 2 weeks use , I noticed issues of insomnia and constipation increase again . I really liked the effects of magnesium chloride so much better than this brand .	-1
I have heard many great things that 5-HTP will do for a person . However , my boyfriend and I both were nauseated all day whenever we take it . With a meal , at night , any way we tried . Please review side effects of this product and use with caution . I know it works wonders for many people , unfortunately I am not one of them . Good luck !	-1
Yet again , I though I found something decent to wipe my Apple Cinema Display . I 've been through so many of these ineffective silly things . The individual packaging for each wipe retains the moisture in the wipes as opposed to the ones that come in a plastic tub , which inevitable dry out . These wipes seem good at first but on subsequent examination it leaves lint on the display and streaks . I tried wiping evenly and very carefully , still no good , same thing . I wish someone would invent something decent that does the job .	-1
*UPDATE*I originally posted a great review about this product , that was after I had been using it for a month . I have now been using this thermometer for 4 months , and during the last 4 months i have used this maybe 4 times . Today i Went to turn it on and the light flashed and then it shut off . It will not come on . According to the manual this thermometer ships with a long life battery and if the battery is low there will be an indication wih an upside down triangle as a warning . I never got any such warning , nor have a i used thise thermometer heavily . It is a rectal thermometer so I only use it when I absolutely have to , which has been no more than 4 times since I bought it . Now the unit is dead . I called in to their customer service line and the best they could do is ask me to ship it back in and wait 4 weeks for a replacement thermometer to be shipped back to me . Why would i want to wait 4 weeks without a thermometer when I have a sick baby ? They rep told me to just replace the batteries , I didnt think it was the battery and when I tried replacing the battery it is still dead . DO not buy this product because the manufacturer doesnt stand behind it and they dont care if you have any issues with it .	-1
The model I got was used.i did not like it.It was very dirty.I recommend the bigger model .	-1
Threw mine in the pail . You could get as much water pressure by just swishing your mouth out with warm water . What a piece of junk .	-1
I unfortunately bought this somewhere else but it is worthless ! ! Wish I had read the reviews first..like everyone else it did n't keep a charge and now wo n't recharge . About 4 months for me..do not waste your money !	-1
Contrary to other reviewers , mine has lasted for about 2 years . Technically it 's still working but I 'm going to have to buy something different . It only really worked well for the first two months , and then became rather weak . No amount of charging brings back the power it initially had.I guess you get what you pay for . My gums need top notch cleaning to stay healthy and this device just is n't really doing it . Plus , the well is so small I have to refill at LEAST twice ... more like 4 times to attempt to do a good job . I think I 'm going to have to move up to the corded versions with the large tanks .	-1
This oral irrigator is so weak that it leaves behind all kinds of food particles . Yes , it 's rechargeable but that does n't matter if the water stream has no power . The other annoying thing is that the irrigator tip rotates on it 's own . It 's impossible to control the spray .	-1
My experience with this unit is identical to one of the earlier reviewers . The unit was fine for some time , than water somehow damaged the battery although I made sure to keep it dry and clean and the socket for the charger tightly sealed . After going through two of these units in less than six months it would really be dumb to trust this product for the third time .	-1
in spite of what you 've read while working your way through these reviews , this item should last for many years , but not if you use it more than once every seven or eight months for no more than thirty seconds at a time.sigh . . .i am guilty of brand devotion . that 's why i paid for a second one . this kind of adoration was warranted many years ago when waterpik made excellent dental care products . it is most assuredly not warranted now.this thing , this portable , re-chargable waterpik , is garbage . all the ugly things you 've read about it are true . ( i have a sneaking suspicion that the 5 star reviews are the result of waterpik astro turfing . if they are sincere reviews by people who actually got the few good portable waterpiks in existence , i hope these lucky individuals will accept my humble apology while giggling amongst themselves - through their sparkling-clean teeth - over my obvious envy . ) and apparently the waterpik people have so little respect for their customers that they ignore the complaints that have to bombard their email inboxes every day as long as we keep ordering this dreadful item.my second cordless waterpik is struggling to get and maintain a charge as i type this . it started with a robust , strong , healthy spray of water when i first got it . i was elated . hopeful . now , barely two months later , the spray is becoming weaker and weaker . it is doing exactly what my first one did , only sooner . i shall not buy another.i do have the standard plug-in `` desk-top model '' as i like to call it , but it has its own issues . scathing review coming soon.final word : do n't buy it . and if you 've written a bad review of it here , go everywhere you can in cyberland and repeat the process . spread the word , good people ! waterpik needs to be brought down for continuing to produce this sorry excuse for an oral irrigation system .	-1
Whatever was wrong with a BATTERY-POWERED * * * NON RECHARGEABLE irrigator ? I had one of these for years and loved it . I do n't like to have a zillion things plugged in on my bathroom counter . In the first place , there are n't enough outlets for the irrigator , the toothbrush , the hair drier , the curling iron , the shaver , etc . ad infinitum.JUST GIVE ME SOMETHING I CAN PUT 3 OR 4 AA BATTERIES IN * * * P-L-E-A-S-E * * * ! ! ! !	-1
A bit disappointing . No sooner do you turn it on , it runs out of water .	-1
This product does work as advertised : it does squirt water in little pulses . Almost nothing else , though , is good about this device . It holds so little water in the reservoir ( about 30 seconds worth ) that in order to clean each tooth the specified five seconds , you have to refill it FOUR times . What were the designers thinking ? Do they really expect users to turn it off , open the lid , pour water inside , start it up , and continue four times ? ? I called customer service and the service person admitted , `` Yes , you may have to fill it multiple times . '' I could tell by her tone of voice that she had heard the complaint many times before.I have not had my unit long enough to say whether the battery lasts a long time -- I know I wo n't have it long enough to find out .	-1
My regular WaterPik was really good and recommended by my dentist . It lasted for about two years and then sprung a major leak . So I saw this version and thought , great ! Less counter space and it 's portable.Every time I use it , the nozzle pops out while I 'm cleaning , which sprays water all over and requires me to stop , refit the nozzle and then continue -- for another few seconds until it pops out again . By then , the chamber is empty and has to be refilled with water . The regular WaterPik holds enough water to last for two minutes . That 's about the amount of time needed to do a thorough cleaning . This device runs out in about twenty to thirty seconds . And the dial at the base of the nozzle , which you 're supposed to turn to direct the stream where you want it , tends to ensure that the nozzle pops out.This is almost useless . I 'd like to find whoever designed it and send him or her for a check up with the dentist from Marathon Man .	-1
This is a terrible product . It has very little cleaning force and holds a very small amount of water . You have to fill it several times to get a complete cleaning . After about a month 's use , it 's stream is so feeble it hardly puts out any water . Just kind of dribbles . Do n't waste your money on this .	-1
I bought this for a long visit with my son , three months . It did not even last three months . No longer works , there should be a better product out there .	-1
The picks bend very easily , and the angle of the device makes it very hard to reach back teeth . Too bad , it 's a good idea .	-1
You can use this as a toothpick at the very least , so it 's not entirely useless , and the vibration may be good for your gum , who knows . But do not use it between dentures , crowns , or fake teeth , result could be unexpected .	-1
Ok , the name got me confused ! I thought this was a water flosser , but it 's not.Instead it 's a flosser , that uses plastic pins , that go between your teeth , and it vibrates the pins . Kind of like a super cheap alternative to a deep cleaning tool from the dentist , only this one is to remove food remnants , and basic plaque.I 've never actually seen it work very well , meaning , in the week I 've tried it , I have n't had it take out one single piece of food between my teeth , so I ca n't comment if it works or not.If anything , it 's just an expensive toothpick that vibrates ! The vibration does help to get the pick into teeth that are closer together ( with less space between them ) , or in between the gumline and teeth.The plastic picks are expensive ( comes with 20 ( I believe ) ) , and they do n't have any fluoride on them.I personally would not recommend anyone to buy it , as I just see it as a wasted invention that wo n't really work well . If you 're into teeth gadgets , you may like this for a while , but you 'll get quickly bored of it ( about as fast as the cheap internal battery lasts ) .	-1
This Item may be good for stimulating the gums , but It 's main purpose as a floss replacer . Ludacrous.It too big to ever get under the gum line to do any good where It counts the most . ALL the other extra heads that come with It In the picture , are all the same size replacements . All one size . I 'd catoragize It as a gadget . I guess nothing can replace floss Itself . Not yet .	-1
The product page said it removed `` allergens '' . It also says on the bottle `` removes allergens '' . But it has a strong fragrance . Many people with allergies have reactions to perfumes and scents . Yes , it 's a nice smell , but that 's not the point . Using this fills a room with the synthetic perfume . This is the type of thing that can give some people bad headaches ! I tried to find ingredients listed on the bottle before opening it but there was no list , just that phrase `` removes allergens '' . I risked opening the seal to sniff it , and lost that gamble . I am disappointed . Why would there be perfume in an anti-allergen product ? Now I have a huge bottle of useless-to-me shampoo.I am back online searching for the key words `` hypo-allergenic '' and `` unscented '' . I feel the packaging/info is misleading to people with allergies . Cat and dog dander are not the only allergens !	-1
Great - if you like burping Oregano ... that 's about it .	-1
Definitely not impressed with this deodorant . This is the second I 've tried and I would rather not wear anything compared to this . The smell was good if you like tea tree ... .smelled `` manly '' . I am a girl . But the worst was how sticky my armpits got after applying this . So , onto my next brand ... .	-1
Just finished my first bottle , and see absolutely no difference in my energy levels , or anything else . Will not be purchasing again !	-1
You do have to adjust your head a bit otherwise its muffled . It took me a few days to position it correctly under the pillow . I put it at a 45 degree angle and it worked perfectly . However , after about a month of use its starting to die on me . One of the speakers is really fissling out , and the other one is starting to fade as well . Its more irritating than `` soothing '' . I would not buy this particular product again .	-1
I purchased this item while on the road for a conference looking to use it for music and not disturb the person I was sharing a hotel room with . I got the package , started my music and hear it relativity well . I was excited , slipped the speaker under the pillow and BAM , no sound . I could n't hear a thing . I really pressed my ear into the pillow and was able to hear a little bit of the music , but a regular position lying in the bed produced nothing I could hear . I 've already sent this back an gotten a refund , save your money !	-1
The opening is way too small and/or too tight to fit over my heel so could not even get it on . I chose size medium , which according to their chart is the correct size for me.I chose not even to send it back due to the horrendous cost Amazon charges to send it back .	-1
Purchased this `` cane/seat '' for my dad who in his old age has just begun needing a cane . Well , this one is not the one . It is too weak to be a cane , let alone a seat . Flimsy design , poor stability , overall ; it 's horribly designed.A definite- DO NOT BUY .	-1
This cane and seat are designed for an anorexic munchkin . It probably works great for someone about 5-foot 2-inches tall and 90 pounds , but everyone else should find a different product . Gave it to a charity .	-1
A friend of mines advised me that I should try SAM-e. SAM-e is vitamin that claim to support and stabilize your mood also suppose to help with depression . Before writing a review I look all 36 tablets as directed . I did not noticed a difference in mood and felt completely the same . This product did not work for me and I may try another brand to see if that will help . All medications works different for everyone and trying another brand may help me . My friend takes Nature Made SAM-e and they claim it work wonders for them . The price for this product was cheap at $ 25 on Amazon but at Walgreens the price is $ 40.99 .	-1
Had to stop taking this product after 3 doses as it appeared as if it was reacting with my anti depressant . This was on the warning lable and my inability to take it in no way deters its effectiveness on others .	-1
This shaver is very durable , nice looking and built well overall . I had bought it for my daughter back in 2007 , when she first started shaving her legs . I was n't comfortable with her using a regular razor , so I gave this one a try , as it seemed to be one of the better ones.She liked it at first and especially liked the way it looked , the color , etc . It 's performance is pretty lousy though , honestly . It does not give a close shave at all . It leaves stubble behind and catches/pulls hairs alot . You have to go over areas multiple times , but even then it still leaves stubble.For my daughter , it was n't too bad as far as the left behind stubble , since the hair on her legs had never been shaved before and was still so very fine and thin , but it did pull the hair alot and took so many passes to clear areas . She got really frustrated . That 's when I decided to give it a shot and realized that it does leave stubble and skips areas and pulls . The blades on the sides pull even worse . Trying to do the bikini area would be traumatizing.It is a shame because it is very well made and it seems like the company put alot of effort into the body of the shaver and then just gave no thought to the blades . 5 years later , it still charges and runs , but it never gets used of course . I just threw it away , right before writing this review , after coming across it in a drawer .	-1
I used this shaver for probably about 2 years . I 'd never had another rechargeable shaver so I really did n't have anything else to compare it to until now that I 've bought myself a new one in another brand . I can now say that this shaver was pretty bad from the start.This shaver never gave me a close cut . If I were to go swimming I 'd have to resort to a disposable razor just to get a close cut.This shaver also gave me MANY in-grown hairs especially at the beginning . I would see hairs growing right under the skin & I 'd have to cut the skin open just to free the hair . I 'm 29 years old & have not had this happen my whole life long . It was quite painful.The only good thing I can say about this shaver is that it keeps a charge for a long time & did n't give me any rashes like disposable razors do.Now that I 've bought myself the Remington WDF-1600 I would say that I would never recommend this Panasonic shaver to anybody & that I 'd highly recommend the Remington WDF-1600 that I now use & really like .	-1
It basically does what its supposed to do . My only complaint is that it has a tendency of pulling the hair too much . I assume this is because the blades do n't spin quite fast enough . *** update . 1 month later and the thing stopped working . The blade is catching on the interior metal . This is probably because the components are cheap Chinese plastic .	-1
This product gets a very close shave and does n't pull hairs . And the light does come in handy . What more could you want , right ? A product that actually does n't break ! My first one I got simply did n't turn on , I chalked it up to being defective and exchanged it for the same thing.The second one worked , although you had to be very careful how you put the battery in or it would n't turn on . Whatever , I got used to it . Now after 2 months it simply wo n't turn on ! And amazon refuses to exchange/return it . Waste of my time and money .	-1
1 . Battery Issue : We have several Panasonic nose hair trimmers . We threw out one of the older ones , because of ( suspected ) corrosion issues with the battery contacts . We then ordered a new one ( ER421KC ) : Dead on Arrival . It would not work with several different brands of NEW AA Alkalines . Finally it did work with a SANYO NiMH . In the end I found one AA unit ( among MANY AA Alkalines ) that it does work with . ( Note , I was THAT close to returning this PANASONIC Nose Hair Clipper ER421 . ) Why do I mention this ? We also have a PANASONIC Oral Irrigator ( EW DJ-10 ) . Same problems , works fine with rechargeable NiMH AAs , but often has problems with Alkalines . Note , they even mention `` corrosion '' issues in the manual for the Irrigator.Panasonic should address this problem ! ( e.g . harder springs , sharp scraping edges for the contacts ? ? ) 2 . the LightThe light of the ER421 is useless - my perspective : It does not point into the nostril , but well sideways3 . Size and ShapeWe much prefer the `` form factor '' of the older Nose Hair Trimmer , it was slim , and not so bulky .	-1
Pulls more than it cuts . Oh the tears .	-1
Approx . a year ago I replaced an older version of this Panasonic nose hair trimmer with the ER421 . What a mistake . The light is a ridiculous gimmick that eats batteries . I finally gave up after the last battery replacement did n't last a month ( about 3 uses ) . In theory the LED light should n't draw much power , but ... .something sure does . I 've switched to the manual Groom Mate Platinum XL and it seems to do an acceptable job , although it does n't trim as closely as the Panasonic . Should you decide to purchase this trimmer I highly recommend that you close the drain on the bathroom sink if you trim above it and rinse the blade to clean it because that 's what forced me to replace my older version of the trimmer ... .I dropped the blade and it went down the drain . There were no replacements available because Panasonic apparently did some sunsetting design changes that were not improvements , but required the purchase of an entirely new trimmer . So ... .my advice to you is to think twice about purchasing this model . It gave me a year of grief and a bunch of wasted batteries . Happy nose hair trimming to you .	-1
I used this little piece of junk a few times , before I caught on that it is literally destroying the inside of my nose ! ! Thought it was maybe a sinus infection , until the 3rd time and ( yeah , apparently I 'm slow ... or very distracted and I do n't use it often ) . It caused every hose hair to grow inward , which is not only a cute trick but incredibly painful ! Bravo , Panasonic ! My nose has been a mess for a week..it 's full of hair that 's growing under scabs . I 've never had foliculitis or anything of the sort and DO NOT have problem skin.You 've been warned ! Not surprised to read over a hundred other reviews saying the same .	-1
This sucks . Blades dull and motor weakens over time . Even with new battery will run slow and catch on your nosehair and stop , painful . The light is a complete joke .	-1
I was looking forward to an update to an old nose hair trimmer when I ordered this . I was greatly disappointed by the cutting ability - or lack thereof - of this product . I thought I must have put some bum batteries in , but even after replacing the batteries the speed was not good enough to avoid tugging on hairs . Not a good buy .	-1
This trimmer worked great the first few times . Then it got weaker and weaker . Even with a new battery , it constantly stops and causes pain sometimes pulling the hair instead of cutting . Do n't buy this . Really . ( also the light is useless )	-1
When I first recieived and used this product I rated it with 5 Stars and wrote the review below . However , after 6 months the unit would slow down and became very erradict . Threw it away after few more months . This is equal to the really cheap products out there . If you do order this product , hang on to the instructions to figure out how to change battery . There is nothing intuitive about that process . After a couple of months , you 'll be changing batteries on a weekly basis.Very good productVery good product for the price . My main `` like '' of this product is that it is quiet ! I 've bought similiar products over the years and those that could actually cut ear hairs were so noisy with high pitched sounds that it was a pain to use them . This trimmer is very quiet , cuts the hair and gets the job done . I was hestitant because of some of negative reviews but finally decided that one could not expect an engineering marvel for the price . Only improvement I would recommend is the light ; it sure does n't make a lot of sense because of where it 's aimed . However , it 's still nice to have a light in the general area . Overall , cuts and trims about the same as products you can pick up in the store for $ 10-20 , but the low noise level makes this trimmer standout ! ! Face it , the original Sharper Image product is gone so standards/expectations will have to lowered for now .	-1
The LED light on the end is just too much and usually just shines in my eyes when I 'm using it.Stick with a simple trimmer and steer clear of this one .	-1
Cheap plastic , rinky-dink motor ... died after 6 months and MAYBE 5 uses . There 's a reason why you can find a million of these on auction websites . Do n't waste your money . Go for something that is well made ... and seriously ... what is the deal with the light on this ? Where do they think we are using this ?	-1
Having used the ER411 since it first came out , I asked for this new one because the blade on the old one was getting dull . Boy , what a difference and not for the better . Forget the lights and the wet/dry capabilities , it simply does n't get in there and cut down the timber . And in guys , that can be a lot . The ER411 did such a great job , I do n't know why panasonic had to fiddle with the product . I removed both blade components to try and figure out what had happened , and it turns out they actually lowered the distance of the blade 's cutting tip in the new product . Now why would they do that ? I 've seen complaints on the ER411 that it tended to tug , so perhaps this was in response to that . But those comments were few and far between and should not have prompted a complete overhaul of the product . Even the ER412 , which I bought last year , did n't cut a thing . And since returning a nose trimmer is akin to returning used toilet paper ( in my opinion ) , I was stuck with it . Now I 'm stuck with the ER421 and I truly hate it.My next step is to find the old ER411 , not the ER411NC ( which is also just as bad and yes , I stupidly bought that one , too ) . I was hoping panasonic returned to its roots by actually cutting nose hair down to the root with the ER421 , but no such luck.Keep in mind you can also use these trimmers to take care of that Yoda hair that grows on the outside of men 's ears and in our ear canals , and you need something that can get the job done . This does n't do it . So if you 're listening Panasonic , bring back the old blade or at least make it available for people to purchase so we can keep our ER411s . It really is the best trimmer I 've ever used . This is not that one .	-1
My main reason for getting this was to help me UNDRESS . The very first time I used it to remove my tight support stockings , the end bent . It works for some things but is not suitable for my main purpose . It is is NOT very sturdy at all !	-1
I am returning the cushion as it is not memory foam as represented in the description . The insert is a basic 'run of the mill ' foam that flattens like a pancake when sat on . If your truly looking for pressure relief , look elsewhere . If you want to soften your chair , look elsewhere . If you want to spend money friviously , your found your cushion ! ! ! Update : ( 2/28/13 ) Was phoned at work and offered $ 5 to take down my negative feedback . I am insulted . The product is inferior and I believe buyers should know that they are playing Russion Roulette purchasing one of these cushions . I do not want the seller harrassing me for a wrongful good review .	-1
Made a mistake when I ordered this . I have sciatica and this cushion is for what it is titled for . I do n't have that problem . Probably is good for those with a sore & # 34 ; tailbone & # 34 ; wrong choice for someone like me .	-1
Reasonably priced but really is worth what you pay for it . I ordered the fancier more expensive gell seat . It is less combersome and more ergonomically designed .	-1
The description reads extra soft but it 's hardly extra soft ! If found this cushion hard and uncomfortable and retuned it for a refund . I will add that Amazon is an excellent on line company to do business with . Their return policy is effortless and returns are never questioned .	-1
The reviewers who have stated that this is not memory foam are correct . It is ordinary soft foam which offers no help even to a 95 lb . woman such as myself . Moreover , the cover is not zippered and removable , as described . Another problem is that the coccyx cutout is larger than on most similar cushions , and larger than appears in the photo - for this photo is not that of the cushion actually sent - altho the price and dimensions on the packing slip make it sound like it is . What I received is much squarer , in addition to not being memory foam or zippered . Fortunately Amazon is great at returns of items that are not as advertised .	-1
This cushion did n't work for me at all . I have tailbone problems and was hoping for some actual support . This cushion does n't hold up . It 's equivalent to sitting on a pillow . If you have tailbone pain , save your money cause this wont help .	-1
This product would not stay on the chair and really did nothing to help me . It is not worth the money	-1
Uncomfortable and really not much fanny protection . I wanted to send it back but , well , I had sat on it .	-1
It 's cheap foam recovered with cheap fabric . I do n't get any support from this and I travel in car every day all week . I should have gone with gel cushion or something else .	-1
I purchased this for a relative 's Stage II decubitus ulcer . You have to place the film on the ulcer . The ulcer stays moist which is supposed to help heal it . It was a sticky mess when I tried to remove the film after 2 days , the instructions indicate it can stay in place for 7 days , but a sticky mess results . I 've only tried it twice , and I 'm not sure I used it as directed .	-1
I bought mine for rehab of my knee ... and returned mine . I realized I 'd rather own nothing than own this . The force is very unevenly applied throughout each cycle . I suspect that all of these products within this price range function similarly .	-1
This came very lightly rusted , but the rust does not impede function . It was easy to screw together and required zero tools . The instructions refer to parts that do not exist , but it 's still incredibly simple.Now then . A bonus : if I invert the pedals so the soles of my feet are against the flexible strap , I can fit this under the desk and still pedal . Neat ! Almost.Right-side-up or upside-down , the motion is too herky-jerky to be pleasant , comfortable , or even something I can perform while working on other things . I would n't give this to someone rehabbing an injury : that process is frustrating enough without wondering if the jerking motions are your injury or the equipment.If I do not remove my size 7 women 's shoe , I can only put my toes and half of the ball of my foot into the pedal strap , which makes an already uncomfortable exercise even more awkward . I know these are prescribed for many elderly who have trouble with shoes , so consider that before purchasing one for granny.I strongly suspect that if you need this to do arm exercises with , it is n't nearly as bad . We have more fine motor control in our arms . Consider velcroing this down to something solid , however , or using duct tape . I would n't dock many points for the wobble : it 's a side-effect of how light the thing is , and is easily remedied by anyone remotely handy.I 'll be getting rid of this and looking for something else . I have aStamina 55-1610 InMotion E1000 Elliptical Trainerat home , and I love it* , but I was looking for something seated to counteract the health detriment of sitting all day at work . I 'll keep looking ! *if you are of tall or average height or if you 're looking for a more intense workout , you might not love it . Be sure to look at reviews before purchasing !	-1
These are not comfortable and do not provide the stability the Chopat Kneebands do . Spend the extra bucks and get the Chopat Knee bands . They only get 1 star because it 's the lowest rating	-1
My significant other did not like the way this feels at all . Although all of our friends wear these it just was n't for him . The strap had nothing to do with the feel . He just did n't like the way it sat under his knee . Just be careful when purchasing this product . If your ok with the placement of the support then I would suggest buying it . If you are not comfortable with the idea then do not even bother .	-1
As another reviewer pointed out -- these batteries did not come in the consumer packet but clipped from some wholesale packaging . One battery pack was even open because if the clipping . Ca n't be sure it is even Energizer . The date of manufacture is 2011 -- no idea what month . These batteries can be anywhere from 14 to 26 months old.Plus they took forever to get here . I almost missed the window to return them.I am not sure if I am allowed to say who the 3rd party seller is . But given I am not the only one to report this -- obviously there is a problem	-1
both batteries were dead on arrival and did not come as packaged in picture .	-1
You 'd think at least one would work but none worked for me . I will never buy anything again that needs these worthless things . The size of a dime and worth much less .	-1
These batteries were for a car remote . Well I put the batteries in and they lasted a total of four locking and unlocking of the car . This is a complete rip off because the batteries are n't set to expire for years . Either Energizer is selling defective batteries or someone out there is stealing Energizer 's name and packaging to make it look like a legitimate product . Regardless , Amazon should stop selling this .	-1
I also got these in non retail packaging . I replaced the batteries in two remotes about a month ago and the batteries have died in both . I 'm assuming I received dead batteries I do not recommend these batteries from this seller .	-1
Much like many of the other reviews , I received old stock batteries . I used them anyway as I needed to for a car remote and they seem to be working fine . Buyer beware !	-1
I need CR2032 for my scale and could n't find it in the Safeway . That 's why I bought this online . It 's not as pictured but works fine right now . Although , by reading other people 's review , I 'm worried how long it can last .	-1
I found the 'medical ' grade Duracell batteries for $ 1.69 for a two pack from an online pharmacy ( hocks pharmacy ) . These are way over priced compared to that . The batteries were the ones advertised , just not inexpensive .	-1
I bought this for my luggage scale but I only used it for a few times and it tells me battery is low ! Extremely disappointed . Bought it from JMD-Batteries . Not sure why there is n't much charge in it . Very disappointed	-1
I bought this battery for my digital scale and it has shown me on the screen that the battery is almost dead and the box is different than what is shown on the website . I 'm disappointed	-1
I ordered 2 quantities of what I believed would be be 2x 2-per-package genuine batteries exactly as shown on this product page . Instead , I received 4 batteries in one long foil package with & # 34 ; Made in China & # 34 ; printed on the battery . I was expecting them to be made in Japan as I 've used this size/brand of batteries before.Amazon marketplace is becoming a Joke and a gamble . You can not trust what you buy , and despite all the complaints here , the seller is still allowed to operate here.If the battery does not function as expected , and I find that it fails or depletes prematurely , I will ask seek a refund !	-1
I 'm in too good of spirits to rant . But the gist is this company sells old dead batteries , so you probably want to look elsewhere . Both of the batteries were dead.My managers buy batteries online also , they have the same problem . Lots of companies apparently have a ton of dead batteries they are just pawning off instead of recycling.Hope this helps , do n't get scammed : ) . `` Ordered from MYBATTERYSUPPLIER '' If anyone cares to know .	-1
The page where one might buy an Army pocket watch shows these batteries as an accessory for the watch . It is not , but about 5 the times the physical size . The actual battery is a SR626W . I ordered these from Amazon and not another seller . Buyer beware !	-1
I should have given more thought to the previous reviews.As described in the previous reviews the picture does not match ... the are sending bulk packaging out.The packaging is n't a big deal but I should have taken it as a warning . ( ca n't trust these stingy buttholes ) Once I opened the batteries up , I tested them . I do not normally test my batteries but since this `` blister package '' was ALREADY OPEN ... I thought I would.Well well ... . after putting these batteries through my multimeter I found out that NA @ TIONAL DE @ LS 1NC are sending out USED BATTERIES.At least It only cost me 2 dollars to see what these guys are made of.Enjoy .	-1
This item did not arrive in 2-pack retail packaging shown but in the bulk strip type foil packs including two seperate batteries in their own foil pouch of unknown manufacture and expiration date . I do not recommend purchasing these batteries . They did not arrive in the packaging shown that states 'Retail Pack - 2- Pack ' . The company I purchased from is not customer service friendly . I am reluctant to open and test them as I would like to return them or receive a refund . I do not trust these since the advertising/representation is wrong . Misleading advertising , so , buyer beware !	-1
The 2016 Energizer batteries that were ordered in February 2012 died in my watch the end of July . The battery that came with the watch lasted almost 5 years . Batteries arrived on a small undated card , so do not know how old they were . Will buy local from now on .	-1
I never really trust buying batteries on Amazon . I got these in the mail and the date on them looked alright , but I put them in my car 's keyfob that was dead and in about a week the low battery alert came on again . The last set of batteries I had in them lasted 4 years . Not sure if it was a coincidence or not .	-1
I ca n't agree with the positive feedbacks here since this item did n't work for me as I though was going to do so , . instead it gave me more pain in my foot than without it . My foot got red and painful I had to take them off in the middle of the street because my feet were burning and sore . When I took them off I felt much better.. It did not work for me perhaps because I have flat feet and need something more sophisticated . I gave it 2 stars because they did returned my money with a decent check . Good luck to other users .	-1
This basically cut off my circulation . OUCH ... I tried it a few times and each day I 'd come home and my skin would hurt beneath it . Try anything else ... this is way to painful	-1
Ir hurts my foot more than helping it . Its just a piece of elastic that goes over the foot . Would not purchase this product again .	-1
I have a feeling these worked really well in 1957 when they were first sitting on a shelf , but the material has gone bad or something ... like an old , dry rubber band . Really bad stuff ... watch out for this seller too ? ... I think they might have unearthed a Walgreen 's from the 1950s and are trying to sell all the shelved products off as new : )	-1
I had great hopes for this little bandage . Seemed simple and direct . I have been taping my foot for Plantar Fasciitis and hope this would be a good alternative . Alas , it was so tight on my foot I could only keep it on for a few minutes . I have a normal width foot with a bit of a high instep , but this just did n't work . Obviously it is useful for others . So the chance is yours to take .	-1
I ended up buying an insole to help with my arch pain . I was hoping this would work for me but did not . Waste of money .	-1
Do n't need additional support or cushioning with Arch Bandages , BUT THERE ARE BETTER BRANDS AND COLORS OUT THERE ! Great with flip flops and every other shoe I 've tried ! ( Injuries have made my feet less tolerant of ... being ignored in favor of enjoying life . ) Arch Bandages are fantastic -- discovered that I do n't need any additional support or cushioning under the foot or arch when I wear these things ! Arch bandages are a 5-star concept ; however , for several reasons Pedifix is a 2-star execution of that concept.Pedifix Arch Bandage sizing is very inconsistent -- one set of two that I bought are extremely tight , even on a female size 6 ! Strangling tight ! They do n't have to be extremely tight to do their job , and being over-tight might be an issue for people with circulation problems . Personally , if I had circulation issues I would consult my doctor before I used these things.SHOULD Come in pairs ! That should be a given , right ? ? ? *Looks down , one , two . To the right ... one , two . Left ... one , two , three , four -- ah ha , no arches ! ... Sorry Mr Fuzzy , you do n't count on this one ! *What 's with that ancient-bandaid color ? It looks like you 're trying to use a bad-skin-tone color to camouflage your foot thingy ... .Thought we had progressed beyond those old tannish tones.Over Priced ( These guys need to take a long hard look at FlexaMed AB . Amazon -- far superior in too many ways to list . ) ... and Over Packaged -- do we really need a cute little plastic box ? ? ? One of those two issues probably accounts for the other.If Pedifix fixs the quality control , over-pricing , and over-packaging issues I will recommend them as a color alternative , until then I 'm going with the competition .	-1
I could barely get this thing ( size large ) on a pencil . No way I could fit it to my great toe ( which is n't that big ! ) .I know there 's another product out there with more elasticity , one that will accommodate a great toe . Wish I knew which one it was -- and that sellers labeled merchandise more clearly . Perhaps the XLarge would work but the photo used to depict the XLarge shows the sleeve on a middle toe .	-1
I would not recommend this item if you need firmness . Just take foam material and make your own . Cheap make .	-1
Did n't stay put in shoe , in heel , in boot , with sock , in flip flops ... .just would n't stay put . I am too in pain to deal with crunching my toes in a feeble attempt to 'find ' the cushion .	-1
These are much too stiff for my toes . These hurt my feet when I wear them . I like the soft , clear ones much better .	-1
If you think it 's going to help your bunions , sure did n't help mine . Infact , walking with it in shoes eventually hurts . It 's like a stiff piece of cardboard	-1
these socks have very little stretch do n't see how anyone could get them over a cast or post-operative bandaging , very disappointingthey do seem well made so I 'll give them 2 stars but they wo n't work for me	-1
I guess these would be good if you had foot surgery and wanted to place something lose and protective over bandaging , but not for under a boot cast . I was under the impression these would be tall enough to almost reach my knee . They only go about 4 '' above the ankle . Very wimpy , probably would n't hold up to too many washes .	-1
I bought this to treat a small planter 's wart on the bottom of my foot . I had gotten them before and used the clear liquid stuff that was hard to control with it 's dropper , so I thought I would try this . Even wrapping with duck tape , yes that is best , it did n't work as well as the dropper applicator clear kind . I will go back to that .	-1
Am giving this product only 2 stars because it did n't seem to have an effect other than irritating my skin .	-1
I bought this because of all the great reviews and I should have been putting chapstick on my wart for all the results it got me . I put this stuff on and would change the bandaid each day , after few days nothing . When I have used wart products in the past a few day in the skin is always white and eventually starts to gewp off . So either I got a dud too or those other reviews are fakes . This stuff did absolutely nothing .	-1
Had such high hopes but did not work for me at all . Would not recommend to others . Waste of money .	-1
This stuff was useless . Terrible smell , like tea tree and oranges zest . I noticed no effects and it 's pretty thin and runny .	-1
Maybe for a mild case of athlete 's foot . This does not work for severe or chronic tinea versicolor . The tee tree content is pretty high , but it 's not enough .	-1
The soap is great , but when you do the math per oz . the `` value size '' costs more per oz . than the small one . Someone needs to pay attention , since hopefully customers are !	-1
not as comfortable as the fabric version . does not compact sufficiently to give comfort . especially in the ring portion where one attaches it to the toe .	-1
The opaque , white bottle I saw in the item description has the words & # 34 ; No.1885 & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; germicide & # 34 ; , and & # 34 ; sanitizes & # 34 ; on it . What I got is the clear bottle without the word & # 34 ; germicide & # 34 ; and the & # 34 ; sanitizes & # 34 ; is resplaced with & # 34 ; freshens. & # 34 ; Maybe it 's just a marketing/container change , but I 'm not yet convinced the red stuff in the clear bottle does anything at all . 2 stars for now .	-1
This brush is sold locally at the only high-end cookware shop in town , and I bought it originally because I thought they would sell quality stuff . The bristles began falling out of the first one within a week or so , as I recall . The second one lasted a bit longer , but the head cracked and a couple of the bristle bundles fell out ( jeapordizing the disposal , I think , because they are small enough to jam under the little things that whirl around in there and do the grinding , and , they are quite tough ) . I have gone through a couple more of them and had varying experiences . The bristles on the one I 'm using now have curled badly and do n't do a proper job of scrubbing . If I could find a better bet in a dish brush locally I 'd just buy it ; but a good dish brush seems to be a thing that is hard to find . Kellog made one years ago , but they stopped selling it , and since then it 's been a constant quest for me . Another beef I have with this Lodge brush is that the loop at the end irritates my palm when I use it , and so I 've taken off the loop and made a different arrangement for hanging it .	-1
The only piece of crap I 've ever had from Lodge . Cheap , poorly designed waste of time . Fell apart after third using . Wood used absorbs water and splits . Bristles too soft and flimsy . Stick to the hardware store for this type of brush .	-1
this is a good way to clean cast iron but i do n't think it is any better than any other stiff brush for the job . UPDATE : after one month the entire brush top fell off rendering this brush basically useless . very difficult to even get it back into the handle to glue it back together . save your money . how can they put the Lodge name on this piece of junk ? ? ?	-1
Unlike the excellent Lodge Logic ironware , this is a complete piece of junk . If you apply any pressure , the brush head disengages from the wooden shaft . That 's because it 's just pressed in and not glued . I made the mistake of buying two of these . That kind-of worked out since my first one melted because my wok was too hot -- Did n't see that coming but it actually worked better once it was melted -- Go figure !	-1
I did not pay attention on the negative feedbacks of this item . I regret I did not . Trust me , you will suffer from this vitamin or whatever it is . My period is late 8 days and all those eight days I have a terrible pain in my female area I can not even hold myself without analgesics . Please , listen to my review , this medicine is not helping , it destroys the body . I do not know if I will be able to recover from this . I do not know if I got any sickness such as cancer or fibrosis , because 8 days late for the period is too much for me and this Friday I am going to the gynecologist .	-1
I generally have a 28 to 30 day cycle . I ovulate anywhere between CD12 and CD15 . I started this product the beginning of my April cycle . My May cycle started a bit unusual ; this was the 1st only cycle after taking product for a month , when I had n't ovulated by CD20 , I stopped taking it . I did not ovulate until CD33 ( almost 2 weeks later ) and wound up with a 45 day cycle . I have not taken it again . Since this cycle , I 've been right back on track . I do n't know if this product is to blame for that whacky cycle , but its the only thing I can figure . If you do ovulate regularly and on your own , I really do n't think this is the fertility blend to use .	-1
After trying to conceive for a year , becoming pregnant and then miscarrying , I decided this time around I would try Fertilaid in hopes of speeding the conception process . I experienced GREAT results withFertileCM : for Fertile Cervical Mucus ( I highly recommend it , btw ! ) so I figured even if this did n't help , it could n't hurt . WRONG ! I went from regular ( 28-30 day ) periods and ovulating , to just the opposite ! I have n't ovulated in 2 months and my cycles are all out of whack ! After reading the other reviews , I fear Fertilaid is to blame . I have quit taking it and hope to be `` normal '' again soon ! Having said that , for irregular cycles it may be worth a shot . My cousin tried this ( she does n't ovulate or menstruate regularly ) and she got her first positive ovulation test while on this product . She did n't get pregnant , but it gave her hope that maybe soon she will be.So to summarize ... Regular cycles : proceed with caution ! Or do n't proceed at all ! Irregular cycles : It could be worth a shot .	-1
These vitamins are horrible . I had a regular menstrual cycle and after taking one bottle of these , I have not had a period in 3 months ! ! ! I have taken 2 pregnancy test 2 weeks apart from each other so I know I am not pregnant . I blame these pills for messing up my system.I got pregnant so soon with my first child and had grown impatient that I had not conceived another . I decided to buy these on a whim thinking they would help us conceive sooner.If you are regular save your money and start eating a very healthy diet , exercise , get your rest , and take a really good prenatal vitamin . These do n't even contain calcium which is a vital nutrient in conception . This alone should help your chances of conceiving tremendously ! Also , focus your attention on something else besides trying to conceive . The stress can hurt your chances . If exercise is not enough of a de-stresser for you , add yoga and meditation to your daily routine.I did my own research and am now folowing those rules.If you have irregular periods save your money and take vitex with a good prenatal vitamin instead . After doing some research online it seems the herb most often recommended for fertility is vitex . It may take up to 6 months to take full effect , but it 's totally natural and in the long run is probably much safer than taking a man-made fertility drug.I hope this helps ! Good luck on all of our pregnancy dreams !	-1
I decided to order Fertilaid and bought three bottles ( three months ) worth . My cycles can be very long , so I was hoping that Fertilaid would help me regulate my cycles and ovulate earlier ( I 've had a cycle that was 124 days ! ! ! ) . I decided to order it amongst the good reviews I saw on the Fertility Friend community circle.I took it for 55 days with no regulation of my period . I have n't even really felt different taking it , or felt like it was doing anything worthwhile to me . I 'm on cycle day 58 now ( started Fertilaid on cycle day 3 and stopped on cycle day 57 ) . My prior cycle was only 47 days , so Fertilaid is n't really helping me all that much for having shorter cycles.I 'm going back onto my regular prenatal vitamins in hopes that my cycle will become `` normal '' .I hate to make this a low review , as I had high hopes that it would help regulate my cycles and assist with TTC . I really should n't have to spend loads of money on each bottle for it to take many months to actually do anything for me.I plan on trying some other ways of assisting with regulating my cycles . I hope anyone who takes this sees their cycles improve . Baby dust to all .	-1
I have just general aches in my shoulder and back from everyday life . After reading the reviews I thought this would be wonderful to rub on , instead of always reaching for Ibuprofen . First- it is slightly oily and has a smell of Vicks Vapor rub ( could 've bought that for less ) . It also felt cool on , but did NOTHING - zero- for any pain relief . I did not assume it would take away ALL pain , but help significantly - nothing . Instead I simply added that odd smell to my shoulders and that 's it . Would not recommend at all .	-1
I am a full time groomer , work 50+ hours a week , 8 dogs a day , not a fan of Andis blades . Love their clippers , but their blades lack quality . I prefer Wahl .	-1
I bought two of these and they were both broken and only wrapped in plastic , no boxes . I went to try them and you could hear the broken mechanism in both not catching.I bought these to use at my dads house so now I have to run out and get some at the hardware store . Amazon is sending a call tag for them both . The company that makes these should send them in boxes ! Now to return them they have to go in garbage bags . They do n't come apart for shipping . I could have bought a swifer with better results .	-1
Bon Ami works better . The cheap razorblade that comes with the kit was what I used the most . I suppose its great for older , dull appliances ( seems more like a wax than a cleaner ) .	-1
I love the price but could not swallow 3 pills twice a day along with all the other herbal supplements I take .	-1
Nature 's Way has excellent products but their astragalusroot caps did n't impress me -- I did n't feel any effecteither positive or negative .	-1
My kids love taking these , but I recently asked the company if they contain GMOs . Here is the response I got. & # 34 ; Rainbow Light products are not gmo free . Rainbow Light is working with the non gmo project and with vendors to source non gmo raw ingredients , this is a huge task and certain challenges remain with a few ingredients . These include vitamin C ( originally derived from corn dextrose ) and vitamin E ( originally derived from soybean oil ) . & # 34 ; So I applaud their efforts and honesty , but I will not be purchasing their non-organic products until they are GMO free .	-1
Rainbow Light is one of my favorite brands of natural supplements ; I take their women 's once daily multi myself every day . I wanted to love these for my kids , but there were 2 shortcomings.1 - the taste was not their favorite . While they did n't moan , groan and cry before eating them , definitely not something they enjoyed . I tried one myself and have to say the fruit punch has some kind of an after taste that was almost a little metallic tasting ? Truly not the yummiest kids ' vite out there.2 - this was my main complaint . The vitamins are pretty large and rather fragile . Every bottle I ever bought always had a number of broken stars that were impossible to eat and made a mess of the jar . I know it 's not a shipping issue , because I encountered the same issue with a bottle that I bought in a retail store . It was just too annoying to overlook and the reason I wo n't rebuy or recommend these .	-1
I 'm very disappointed in Rainbow Light for this vitamin . I have been a loyal customer to Rainbow Light for many years , and buy several of their food-based vitamins to help keep my health under control . I purchased this children 's multivitamin and was very excited to find a food-based vitamin for my kiddo . When we received the vitamins , I gave one to my daughter , and she ate it . She did n't like it too much ( `` Yuck , Mommy , yuck ! `` ) , but I figured I could put it in her morning oatmeal , or maybe in yogurt to get them in her . For no real reason , I glanced at the label , and realized that this vitamins were n't 100 % natural , and not completely food-based as it claims ... it contains the synthetic versions of folic acid and B-12 ( which is derived from cyanide ) rather than the `` Active '' forms of the B vitamins ( methylfolate , aka `` folate '' , and Methyl-B12 ) . I assume Rainbow Light is using the cheaper synthetic versions of these vitamins for cost reasons , but for about 40-60 % of the population , these vitamins are useless because of a mutation in the MTHFR genes . I know for a fact that my and my daughter 's body is unable to convert these synthetic vitamins into anything useful due to our MTHFR mutations , and in reality , it is harmful for us to be taking them . When I realized all of this , I promptly set up a return to get my money back . It certainly makes me rethink buying my other vitamins from this company .	-1
I have used L-Lysine for years to prevent cankor sores . With this one I have to take two tablets two to three times daily . I have never had to do that . That is 3000 mg in order to get this one to work . I have NEVER had to use that much . Normally I take 500 mg four times a day and that works great this one does not work and I will not buy it again . I would not recommend purchasing this one it is a complete and total wast of money .	-1
They shrank when I did n't follow directions and put them in the dryer . I could n't believe the laundry instructions were `` for real '' . Who lets a sheet air dry these days ? Where is the clothes line any way ? Unless you are fortunate enough to still own one , do n't buy these sheets . The top sheet and the the face `` thing-ee '' survived the dryer but the fitted sheet is smaller now .	-1
I am an adult that has a tube in my ear and I own a swimming pool . Can not get water in ear . Bought this and a head band to help keep it in and this is not large enough in circumference to keep water out of my ear . Maybe good for kids ... .	-1
Mechanical design flaw . does n't roll into ear easily , keep bending . Too flimsy Should make a bit firmer to be efficient..	-1
I have small ears , I guess . I only got these to properly fit in once . Lost one on the second swim try . Read others tips and still had no luck . Had better luck with the silicon waxy things , though I hate how those collect debris.Not for everyone , it seems .	-1
Hard to get these into my ears , especially after taking a shower before getting into the pool . I ca n't get them to stay in place or to stop leaking . Maybe it 's just me .	-1
They fall out . Seventeen more words were required to finish the review , but now I have it down to one .	-1
I bought these because they were cheap and had good reviews , but I have found they do not keep the water out for me .	-1
First one I received had torn stitching . Looked like it was well used , but it was packaged like it was new , so who knows . I sent it back and received another . This one also looks well worn but the stitching is OK .	-1
Yuk ! After trying the Crystal Body Deodorant stick based on the reviews I read on Amazon , and willing to try something new , I placed my order . Much to my chagrin , both my wife and I wound up with itchy armpits ... and I experienced the most sour armpits in my lifetime . Wo n't go back , wo n't reorder , wo n't consider at any cost . I 'm done.Would however , return the product if I could .	-1
This product arrived quickly and as far as I can tell it was intact and as advertised . But I used a few drops mixed in a glass of water last night as a mouth rinse and not only did it make my mouth ache for at least 30 minutes after using it , today my throat was sore ( maybe related ) and everything I eat and drink has a strange bitter taste ( definitely related ) . It 's been 24 hours and everything still tastes weird . Kind of like that taste when you drink orange juice after brushing your teeth . It 's a bummer ! Here 's hoping it 's all better tomorrow . This stuff is definitely not going into my mouth again ... I 'll keep it around for external use .	-1
This is a waste of money if you 're looking for concentrated GSE : I found out when I received it that it contains that much veg . glycerin and only 33 % gse . What a rip off . I 'm going to look for Citricidal .	-1
I used this for several days , as directed ( 10 drops in a glass of water , 3/day ) , while I had a cold/sinus infection . I felt that there was no benefit at all . I have used their nasal spray and like it for it 's moisturizing quality .

Bought this based on a Youtube recommendation . Later I learned that many brands of GSE are adulterated . Dr. Weill says it is n't worth the risk . And other reviewers have commented that the taste has changed . The company has n't really answered their questions well.I 'm thinking that I might or might not use this topically , but I need to do a lot more research first .	-1
I bought this product after hearing all the amazing testimonials about what it could do . After taking with water , like the package suggested , for some time I saw no changes for better or worse . I read somewhere that these products are often faked and that the only way to tell is if the front label perks up to reveal more information . I do n't know if this is true but mine definitely did not . I may try purchasing this in the future from a trusted seller like whole foods but for now I have no interest .	-1
I have severe allergies . Desperate to try anything that might help I tried this in my neti pot and orally , Could n't tell it did anything	-1
do not buy . changed formula is useless . I confirmed with a friend of mine who used to use this product . we both tried it and it does n't taste like the old one . also the positive effects do not seem to set in.I recommend citrosept dot at . guys deliver to USA . stuff is pretty expensive though	-1
I have read a lot of articles on GSE and this is my first time ordering it so I am really confused on the taste . Mine has a silky very slightly sweet taste with a slight after taste of citrus.I shook the bottle and the extremely thick liquid did n't move , I had to take the red pour top off to make sure something was in there , I then put a big drop on my finger to feel it , no burning tingling or smell , I tasted it and again no burning tingling or smell I just tasted what I described previously , now to get to what I have read I should of had some kind of reaction either on my finger or on my tong according to all articles . Right ?	-1
I ca n't tell that this product did a thing to increase the lifespan of my humidifier filters , or to keep the overall humidifier cleaner . If anything , the oil created a film that built up and made the unit cloudy . It may be a fantastic antifungal in other uses , but this is one in which it fails . Definitely do not recommend .	-1
Real citricidal GSE is FANTASTIC and i rave about it all the time . Unfortunately this is not it . Nutribiotic has changed suppliers and the new GSE formula is ineffective and a total waste of $ . I have some of the real deal left in an old bottle i bought a few years ago , and it works wonders . The actual citricidal GSE that Nutribiotic used to use is amazing . It kept a tooth infection at bay for months ( about a year actually ! ) It really helps with sinus & dental problems and help me get over bugs . I am so glad that I have some left in that old bottle because this new bottle i just bought on amazon does not contain citricidal GSE . The label is updated to say `` grapefruit seed extract '' instead of `` citricidal '' GSE . This new crap does not taste bitter & is not effective like the citricidal that works so well . I contacted the company & apparently they switched suppliers and they no longer use citricidal . They claim that it is just as effective but that is B.S . I was immediately skeptical when i noticed the lack of bitterness , but gave it a try over several days . Well , I can definitely tell the difference in my sinuses which are now feeling stuffier , and my breath does n't feel as fresh . I sent the bottle back for a refund.So , while I recommend citricidal GSE , i do NOT recommend this new formula that Nutribiotic has put out . Do yourself a favor and do some research before buying . Do n't just order a bottle off of amazon . Find a supplier that still carries some older bottles made with the citricidal or another brand that uses the citricidal GSE and buy from them .	-1
I have n't ordered any more of this because I used the whole bottle and could not perceive any particular benefit .	-1
I purchased this item for my four year old son who is on the spectrum ; mainly for his adhd . I'v read from so many other autism parents that gse helps a lot with yeast overgrowth that may contribute to certain inappropriate behaviors and I thought I would give it a try . Unfortunately this stuff seems to make his hyperactivity worse . The self injury has increased and it 's harder to slow him down . I do n't know whether is a die-off issue or what ; but I do know that it 's gotten worse ! On another note , I took a little and noticed a stubborn skin irritation on my neck has disappeared !	-1
Oral-B Pro White Replacement Brush Head ( 3 ct. ) I bought this brush head for the polishing cup feature . While I have n't used it enough yet , I 'm not quite convinced the polishing cup really makes a difference . I had hoped that using it with a polishing paste would have the same effect as the dental hygienist 's polishing cup , but it does n't seem to . The paste just scatters on the tooth rather than being concentrated where I have placed the cup . Maybe I 'll get better at it , but currently it 's just another brush head in my dental regime arsenal !	-1
I have been using the Oral-B Vitality electric toothbrush for about six years now , and have used several different toothbrush heads with it . However , this Prowhite brush head is my least favorite . I found that the hard plastic cup in the center was hard on my gums . Maybe it was just me , but we did n't get along and I can not recommend it .	-1
I do n't abuse the brush head since I brush lightly two times for two minutes a day . My routine involves a balance regime of mouth rinse and floss in addition to brushing . 100 % of the time , the bottom half of the brush will break off leaving you with a regular top half brush which I could have purchased elsewhere for much cheaper.Most of the time , when the bottom half breaks off , my brush head is still new- meaning no discoloring of the bristles or bending of it ( just to show that I 'm not using these brushes for more then 4-6 months ) .	-1
This brush is supposed to be like a brush and flosses too . Did not like it as it was too rough . Have gone back to regular brush so would not order again but would order regular brushes again .	-1
I used these for my oral electric toothbrush for over 2 years . However , I recently stopped because my dentist noticed gum recession ( not good ) and mentioned that a lot of electric toothbrushes do n't have soft bristles . These feel noticeably more hard/firm that my soft manual toothbrush , and I regret not being smarter about switching over to electric .	-1
thisa thing crumbles a lot but does smooth feet to an extent . I prefer stone over this because of all the waste that falls off .	-1
I was better off getting the unmotorized one , I returned this one was not happen with quality of product . : (	-1
I purchased this item after experiencing a similar item at my hair salon . The tines on this item are stiff and uncomfortable . It 's shape does not contour well to the head . It provided no relief or benefit and was a complete waste of money .	-1
I read several reviews that said they loved the electric vibration of this item . I got one based on those reviews , I was sorry I did . It is very loud and vibrates too hard ! ! Nothing relaxing about it at all ! ! I 'll use it without the thing turned on I guess .	-1
These are so cheap I could n't resist . They do fit my toothbrush base ( oral B sonic vitality ) but do n't go all the way down and there 's a little buzz when it 's on . No biggie , they work fine . But the brush is fairly soft and after only a few weeks it 's too soft to do any good . I figure each brush lasts about 2 weeks before I have to put on a new one .	-1
I use three razors . Last year 's model of this Braun , a triple blade rotary from the leading manufacturer of rotary razors and standard double edged disposables from the major manufacturer of razors.OK , now , let 's do some math . I get 10 great shaves from a disposable razor . I pay , on average , 40c or so for a disposable razor . That is about a nickel a shave including the shave cream . At a nickel a shave , it would take 3000 shaves before I would spend $ 150 . Would take me over 8 years.Now , anyone that says any electric razor shaves better than a double edged high quality blade razor ( not even the expensive triple edged ones , just cheap disposables ) is dreaming . The blace does a much better job and much faster . But , sometimes , they can irritate the skin , but electrics can too . I can get irritated by both , sooooo , I rotate between them , and find that reduces my skin irritation problem quite well.I bought this Braun ( last year 's model ) after reading the positive reviews here , and later bought a rotary razor . The basic difference is that the cheap model rotary from that major manufacturer is much quieter , shaves just as well , and cost me about 1/3 the price.The only thing that is better in the Braun is the battery lasts longer . It is possible also , that in some cases , it gives a slightly closer shave than the rotary , but it also tends to miss spots no matter how many times I go over them . The Braun also has a problem with my beard when it is longer , like when I have two to three days growth . The rotary and disposable razor breeze through that three day bush.The cleaning machine/charger that comes with the Braun is a joke . Yes , it cleans the razor great , but it is way oversized and you need a large space for it in your bathroom . Even then , say you have that larger space , you can pay between $ 5.00 and $ 8.00 each for the cleaning cartridges . I have found they last about a month before drying out . Add $ 60 to your annual cost to just clean your razor . The rotary cleans fine with a brush and the disposable razors with water.Finally , the switch that turns on the razor is right where you hold the razor and it also locks the blade . So I am constantly locking the blade position by accident . Inexcusable design flaw in a razor this price.Do n't get me wrong . This razor shaves fine . It works best on short beards and works better than cheap razors . But for $ 50 you can get a better rotary razor and for $ 150 you can shave for over 8 years with a disposable twin blade .

I 've had a Braun 8585 for years ... got this to replace the cutter and foil . I found the shave quality decreased and the blades started pulling whiskers . Also I was nicked more often.I finally replaced the cutter and foil on my 8585 with this : Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack ( Formerly 4700,7000 ) . It fits perfectly and gives me an excellent shave . No more pulling , no nicks , and a closer shave . Definitely the way to renew an 8000-series razor.Avoid this foil and cutterblock !	-1
I have very dry lips , and have tried a variety of lip balms over the years , ranging from low-end ( Chapstick , Vaseline , Neutrogena etc ) to higher-end ( Jack Black , Kiehl 's , etc ) . I decided to try this Canus organic lip balm out , but I did n't care for it . Its performance did n't help nearly as much as other brands on my lips . I also thought the odor was a little strong , and the balm itself was too soft ( so I would get small pieces of it on my lip after applying ) . Despite the low price , I wo n't be purchasing this again .	-1
Dried out my lips . Horrible fake spearmint flavor . I hated it . My daughter hated it . Will stick to Burt 's in future . Burt 's is the best out there . Period .	-1
I took this about 7 months ago for several weeks and it worked for the first few days but had no effect thereafter . I was frustrated and tried the unpopular synthetic product Benefiber instead and very much like this product , I gradually increased the dosage . I eventually moved away from Benefiber and I 'm still incurring many of the symptoms of IBS . Nevertheless , this did n't work for me . I gave it 2 out of 5 stars instead of 1 out of 5 because it worked for the first few days , so something productive happened .	-1
I took this for anxiety . I took between 2 to 4 pills a day which according to studies is a low amount . Studies had success with 4 grams up to 12 . Anyway it did seem to calm me but I have many issues which I attribute to taking the isonitol for the past month since I changed nothing that I can recall and the symptoms have begun to dissipate since I stopped taking it . My issues were carb craving and sweet craving so bad that I actually gained 10 pounds in a month . I do n't tend to gain weight easily so this was a shocker ... I do n't recall gaining that much that quickly while pregnant . While my hair and nails seemed to improve , I got cystic acne . I have gotten it at times in my life but in one month I have had 7 large painful cysts that have taken forever to go away . Some were right next to other ones . It took me a while to think everything was related to the isonitol but now I am pretty sure it is.I stopped taking the pills a week ago and the crab/sweet cravings are gone so I am hoping I can lose the weight quickly . I am still dealing with the cystic acne . I guess it is worth a shot since it is cheap but if you some explained issues like mine try stopping it for a while and see if that is the cause.Just fyi , I wanted to update because I am pretty positive now this stuff caused my weight gain . I have done nothing different other than stop taking it and lost about 5 pounds in the less than 2 weeks since I stopped taking it . Unless this lowers metabolism in some people ? Maybe it was all water weight gain . I do n't know , but that seems like a lot of weight to loose .	-1
Maybe it 's because I 'm not used to waxing myself , maybe it 's because I do n't have a wax warmer , maybe I did n't let my hair grow long enough ... whatever the issue , this kit is not as quick and easy as it claims to be . I found it to be very messy and not very effective . I almost ran out of strips before I was finished with one leg . I had to go over the same spots multiple times , and still ended up using my razor to finish the job . It may work better if you are more experienced or possible have a wax warmer . Who knows . I only know that it did n't work for me and that it 's not really worth the time , money , or clean-up in my opinion .	-1
Might just be me but using those waxing stripes are difficult and no hair removal happens . Would not recommend to anyone .	-1
The instructions of this package was clear , but it just did n't work as well as I 'd expected . It was also painful to remove hair as with other waxing products.Caution : Be careful not to microwave the tub of body sugar for too long , otherwise it 'd be burning hot !	-1
I have been sugared many times and get sick of paying for it , so I bought this . NOT THE SAME ! I bought the warmer , and the sugar never got to the correct temp , I guess , because I could not get my hair off . I ended up with a sticky , swollen leg in this case . At least sugar rinses off , but this did not work for me at all .	-1
I bought this because some reviewers said that it helped them as a desk cushion . My desk chair has lost all its cushion and I sit all day for my job , so I was hoping this would help . The individual air bubbles sounded like they would be great , but they were n't . The air shifts to different bubbles depending on how you sit , flattening out totally in some areas . I always felt off-kilter and it just was n't soft enough .	-1
Wish I 'd read all those reviews saying how bad these perform . These were a total waste of money . The battery life is terrible and I have even put brand new batteries in that were completely dead . Do not buy these if you can help it .	-1
Waste of money . Put four of these in an electric ruler I own and they would n't even power it up . Wii remotes eat these like tic tacs .	-1
If you are looking for a cream that will moisturize this is not it . The texture is more like a wax cover for your feet mimicking a moisturized soft hand but your feet will not be softer with time and the dryness will not be alleviated . It does not get absorbed into the skin and i found it to be a total waste of money . Its cheaper and better to use vaseline and cover your feet with socks that to use this .	-1
I saw this product in the store so decided to get it on Amazon . I had really high hopes for this product . I have really dry heals in feet . So I thought this would help my feet . This stuff did n't do anything for my feet . What a waste of 7.00 .	-1
I thought that this was a bit expensive but I use foot cream everyday so I gave it a try.It is a thin cream that rubs in well.It just did not work well for me .	-1
Have seen this at a local store and a friend swears by it.It is VERY long lasting but I just do n't see the big deal . One small jar goes a long way and maybe that justifies the expense ?	-1
I 've been looking for a cheaper alternative to Nordic Care ... .I bought this based on the reviews . This has the consistency of crisco ( not the oil.. the white kind ... it called lard ? ) . It did nothing for my cracked heels is very oily and a waste of my money .	-1
I 'm not very happy on the product and wish moisture of the foot cream lasted longer than a few minutes , it feels like a water based lotion and needs to be used several time a day .	-1
I have this star because I found a home remedy that works just as fast as is probably in your house ... .Purchased O'Keef 's a while back it and put it on my heels which stopped the cracking and gave me smooth feet . A girlfriend ( now ex ) borrowed it and never gave it back so I decided to google a remedy . Come to find out vegetable oil is what 5+ sites recommended . Since I did n't have vegetable oil on hand I decided to use olive oil before bed and with socks on . After two nights I got the same results as O'Keef 's ! ! ! ! Personally I say give the oil a shot before you buy this . I also tried almond oil ( massage oil ) and found it works the same . Like I said , O'Keef 's works but there are cheaper ( and readily available ) alternatives that have the same if not better results .	-1
This is a relatively waxy feeling product , sort of a soft chapstick . I did not find it helped with cracked feet at all , and would recommend Aquaphor or other products instead .	-1
I did not like this product at all . I usually hunt for natural products avoiding chemicals and additives . That is very hard to do with lotions and creams . The last few months have been brutal on my feet while I was away from home caring 18 hours a-day for a dying parent . I was in a completely different climate than my body is used to , my normal routine , and my normal products . My feet became dry and cracked , worse than I have experienced . I decided to resort to this chemical laden product in return for a quick guaranteed fix . Figuring that I could return to my normal organic healthy life when I return home.HAH ! My first response to Healthy Feet ... I was unimpressed by how thin it was . It felt a little like a teflon coating . I put socks on over it ... that was n't so easy because my socks stuck to it , unlike a teflon coating . It was actually difficult to pull my soft loose weave socks onto my feet . I was n't expecting that . I actually had sock lint stuck to my feet a few hours later when I went to bed -- because my feet were sticky from this product.Anyway it was a strange a feeling as I sat watching a movie periodically becoming aware that my feet felt strange like I could feel the product penetrating int my feet . ( Not in a good way . ) This product felt very strange on my feet . My sister had sworn by the same brand hand lotion for dry cracked hands so I was n't worried about the product harming me too much through short term use . As I was climbing into bed I decided to re-apply the Healthy Feet cream . With the second application within minutes I could really feel the product absorbing into my feet . I thought I will quickly go to sleep ( I was very tired ) and it will do it 's work healing my cracked feet while I sleep that is what the the directions stated that it would do . The penetration feeling became more and more pronounced as I tried to sleep . I tossed and turned and realized that my feet had become tender feeling with almost an aching through the layers of skin and muscle . I tried to ignore it for a couple of hours and finally in the middle of the night I got up and scrubbed it off of my feet with hot water and soap . That brought relief to wash as much of it off as possible and I was finally able to sleep . Upon waking my feet still feel tender . I will not ever put this product on my skin again .	-1
Sorry O'Keefe and your fans . This stuff feels gross . After soaking and washing feet , drying well , and applying this cream , it feels gritty and rolls up in clots . Severely gross . Yuck .	-1
The product feels funny in your hands so when you rub it into dry cracked feet it feels like there is dry skin in your hands as you rub it in and all in all the product DID NOT help my boyfriends very dry cracked feet . I would n't recommend this product since regular lotion worked just the same and did n't feel gross in my hands .	-1
I 'm not sure if I have a different model from the other reviewers , but this foot massager sure is loud . It makes a grinding sound that , at least , drowns out the motor of my desktop fountain . Like other reviews say , I do n't feel the heat and my feet slide off the rollers when I use socks , as recommended . I 've only had it two days , so do n't know how long it will last . Still , at $ 40 , it 's cheaper than a masseuse.EDIT : After 7 months , it died . I used it pretty infrequently ( once a week or so ) , and am dropping my rating to two stars.EDIT : Just got a wooden foot roller massager , at about half the price . It wo n't break , it 's easy to use , and you really *don't* need an automatic roller for your feet . You can move your own feet just fine . Dropping rating to one star .	-1
I got this for Christmas and I used it for about 20 minutes . I liked it a lot when it worked . The next day , I tried turning it on . The light came on but the massager was not working . I returned it today and after reading the other reviews , I decided not to get a new one . It seems like this product is a problematic one as its motor burns out so fast . I would not recommend it .	-1
Caused extreme upset stomach even though this form is suppose to be gentle on the digestion . Trading migraines for intestinal troubles was not my goal .	-1
Someone in the `` Customer questions '' wrote `` If you do n't start showing the back of the label we are not going to buy supplements on Amazon ! ! I totally agree with this person 's frustration because if i had known in advance what are the `` Other Ingredients '' listed on the bottle ( that i became aware of only after opening my package ) , i would definitely not have bought this brand . Here are the `` Other Ingredients '' : Microcrystalline Cellulose , Vegetable Cellulose , Silica , Dicalcium Phosphate , Vegetable Magnesium Stearate , Titanium Dioxide , Vegetable Glycerin.Titanium Dioxide might make their tablets a whiter white , but it 's sure not something i wish to ingest every day , and two rather large tablets -- not one -- is the serving size . Silica is another ingredient i 'd rather not ingest daily.It is so convenient to buy on amazon but i now see that it is really necessary to first check the facts on the manufacturer 's website . If i can return this , i will . Almost always , i buy the Life Extension Foundation brand because i feel they are the most trustworthy . Their interest is truly in improving our health , not their own bottom line . Doctor 's Best is usually a safe bet too.UPDATE : i returned Solgar and purchased Life Extensionhttp : //www.amazon.com/Life-Extension-Magnesium-Citrate-Capsules/dp/B000LLULUMThe ingredients are : Magnesium Citrate 160 mg , vegetable cellulose ( capsule ) , L-Leucine . Wonder why Solgar decided to throw in all those `` other ingredients '' ( ? ? ? )	-1
That 's right , this product contains nano particles of titanium oxide . Why , is it good for your health ? No , because it is a natural color . I 'm not making this up ! Nature Made magnesium has it too , but they `` incorrectly '' call titanium oxide an artificial color . The FDA classifies this untested nanotech particle as natural.I do n't use sunscreen because of concern that nanotech titanium oxide might actually cause skin cancer . Now they want me to eat it with my vitamins and minerals ? Vitacost here on Amazon has banned this dangerous chemical from all its house brand vitamins . So dump this one and check out vitacost products.The Canadian occupational health and safety organisation says this compound may cause cancer , and there is a concern about what nanotech titanium does to your organs . But at least the tablets in this jar look gray and mineral-rich , rather than the white color that magnesium normally is.I bought the product from Vitamin Shoppe , and returned it for a product called `` Calm '' which has only magnesium and vit C , which helps to create the correct absorption balance in the stomach . But in the future I plan to buy from vitacost .	-1
I had purchased a similar high end brand 15 years ago and they were not as good at holding on to fine hairs as they were in the past so I decided to order a new pair . I read excellent reviews of this product so I opted to purchase it rather than the exact one I had before . My old ones perform better than these after 15 years . Good ones are worth the high price but I will buy the other brand this time . If its ' not broke do n't fix it - right ?	-1
I was disappointed in the way these tweezers grab the hair . I find that my $ 8 pair from Walgreens is much more effective .	-1
The readings were so consistently inaccurate that I thought I was either going to pass out or have a stroke .	-1
Worked for a few times and then just stopped . Tried new batteries to no avail . Threw it in the garbage yesterday .	-1
Whatever happened to the old reliable quickie refills made from cellulose sponges ? These cheap foams are not only NOT absorbent , but the foam sponge separated from the plastic backing with only light use . In the old days , they were made from cellulose sponge and it would last until the sponge literally disintegrated from age ( I mean years ) . This new sponge barely had any use and the plastic backing separated making it absolutely useless . Cheap manufacturing that not only rips off the customer but adds to the landfills prematurely . I bought a refill from home depot , but the holes do n't align which means that I would need to buy a whole new mop too . really makes wonder about this company.I wish there are better products out there so I do n't have to buy this quickie crap . I still love the decades old mop design though , which is difficult to substitute.Updated : I used Elmers glue to glue the sponge back to the plastic backing and it fell off in single use . Then I used an entire small tube of instant epoxy ( Duro Super Glue ) from the dollar shop ( about $ 1 worth ) to glue one side of the backing to the sponge ( I rubberband it after applying glue and let it dry for maybe 48 hours ) . After maybe about 8 uses or more so far and still holding up . 5 stars for the epoxy and about 1 star for the quickie refill.A few months later , the other side came off as well . Used another small tube of epoxy to glue it back . Hopefully , it can now last years w/ light weekly use .	-1
Those easy to change mop heads are just about the cheapest piece of junk I 've seen . I worked as a mechanical engineer and I have seldom seen anything quite so flimsy in manufacture . The concept is excellent if the plastic did n't snap when turned to secure the mop to the head of this wondrous device . All I wanted was a simple mop . This was a complete waste of money and broke immediately.UPDATE ALERT : After some investigation , I learned that two twist on plastic nuts were supposed to part of this breakthrough in moppery . Perhaps if I had been supplied with those with my order , this all would have made a lot of sense . But a plain set of 1/4 page of directions with two diagrams would save a lot of trouble . However , the Quickie outfit is more interested in a quick buck by providing the consumer with a mop made of featherweight plastic that might as well have a label on it warning that `` This Mop Will Break If Actually Used and Maybe Even If Touched . Use Only If You Feel Like A Lucky Fool . ''	-1
Crap . Did n't last more than a few months in a calculator that I virtually never use . Seems to be the case with some items on Amazon , you get a good product that is just expired or damaged or otherwise not up to normal standards .	-1
I buy my batteries on line to save a little from store bought ones . I tried every battery in the pack and none of them worked . Had to finally go out and buy a working set .	-1
I purchased these batteries for use in a small , battery-operated candle - the kind that imitates a flame by flickering off and on . I do n't think this is a particularly energy-intensive use . Batteries that I 've bought for this purpose before have lasted for a couple weeks of continuous usage ( more if I remember to turn the candle off ) . These batteries produced a feeble light , as though they were already nearly depleted when I began to use them , and lasted exactly 90 minutes before they stopped working entirely . I realize these were cheap and that you do get what you pay for , but it 's also true that it 's just plain illegal to sell an item that ca n't be used for the purpose for which it 's advertised . These batteries are useless , and Amazon should cease dealing with the vendor who advertises them .	-1
Another dud . I do n't think any of these products really works well and I have tried several different brands . Do n't know if price is any indicator either .	-1
This has to be the most uncomfortable back and shoulder support I have ever purchased . Do n't waste your money !	-1
It is very difficult to put on by myself and in uncomfortable-it really rubs around the arms . Maybe a more expensive model would be better-one that does n't put so much pressure under the arms .	-1
Where do I start ? There are 3 operation positions , 'Vibrating Massage with Smart Heat and Bubbles ' , 'Vibrating Massage with Smart Heat ' and 'OFF ' . OFF is the best position for this thing.I have a small foot for a man size 9 and the water does NOT come close to covering the foot even 'without ' any of the silly rollers snapped in . The snap in rollers are not motorized and are just nobby bumps that you roll your arch against BUT if you use the rollers it holds the foot almost out of the water and if you do n't use the roller your foot blocks the few openings for air bubbles are blocked . Water depth is LESS than a 'inch and a half ' at the arch with the foot blocking the bubble holes ! ! So , forget about the 'smart heat ' thing , you have to use warm water to start with ( which is no big deal ) because it 's less than 3 quarts to fill the tub for both feet . Your toe tips may be all that is underwater and if you want the bubbles you must raise the foot to NOT block the openings for the bubbles that ONLY run down the middle of the foot.There is no churning and water agitation , just a little vibration and some bubbles but lots of noise . There is a warning to never run the unit over 20 min with 10 min being typical . The so called 'Smart Heat ' is worthless and I immediately noticed a drop in temperature ( I was using Smart Heat with bubbles and vibration.The water fill line is a white raised line on a white background and is easier to find by feeling because I could n't see it . Not a big deal once you learn but does indicate a thoughtless design.The damning thing is , it DOES N'T even cover your foot , drops in temperature and any 'massage ' effect is in my opinion a plectra effect . This is beyond worthless and I expected much better from the company who NOW is selling an update version that looks like it still may have the depth and bubble placement problem but I will NOT purchase the new unit.Some may say what do you expect at the price ? I expect something that at least resembles a foot spa as the name suggests.I sawed off the power cord and it 's now in the trash . You are better off using a deep container and filling it with warm water and forget all this 'puffery ' ... Typically I 'm very forgiving in my reports but NOT this one . Yes , I 'm angry .	-1
Because of the great reviews here , I ordered this on Wal-Mart.com , thinking I had researched enough and had the best one . Not ! My old one died , after some 20+ years , its name had fallen of years ago , but it was a tank ! And so I 'm comparing this one with it . I may never find another . First off , no heating . None . Second , when it 's filled w/ water , you have to carry it with both hands , trying hard not to slosh the water all over everything . The old one , I just grabbed it with one hand , and the water went to the front of the tank . I could forgive all this if it had a decent massage action , but that 's so faint it 's not even worth mentioning . The bubbling is sort of cute but not relaxing , and it actually splashes out of the tub . The toe-touch control is so stiff I ca n't operate it with my foot . The removable massage gadgets are uncomfortable , all of them , so I removed them ; the floor does n't fit the form of my foot . Any positives ? It 's light weight . Wal-Mart will be getting it back , and my search goes on .	-1
Does n't massage , does n't keep heat , does n't really do anything that a tub of hot water could n't do . It 's so loud I ca n't use it and watch TV as well . What a piece of junk .	-1
I have been suffering with IBS symptoms this past year and have tried a number of natural remedies including Heather 's Tummy Tamers . After giving this brand a go and using about four bottles I have come to the conclusion that there are inconsistencies in quality from one bottle to another . Even though I have used it on an empty stomach as directed I often have a warm crampy burning sensation in my stomach after taking it , which is fairly unpleasant , almost painful . This is not supposed to happen with an enteric-coated capsule . It should pass intact into the large intestine but these do n't seem to do that reliably . With Heather 's , sometimes I burp within a few minutes of taking it and can taste the peppermint right away.For what it 's worth , I do NOT suffer from either heartburn or acid reflux so these symptoms I can absolutely attribute to the capsules within 15 minutes or so of taking one . I have since ordered a more expensive brand and this has never happened , not once . I chose peppermint for hypermotility issues ( too frequent bowel movements due to hypermotility of the large intestine ) in an attempt to slow things back down to a normal 2-3 times a day.I wanted to like these but I ca n't recommend them . Bottom line : if you taste the peppermint or feel it burning inside immediately after taking it , even on an empty stomach , it has dissolved in your stomach , which negates the beneficial action of the peppermint in the large intestine completely.This is an update of 5/7/2012 . I have since found a product called Intesol by Metagenics and I have written a detailed review . If you are suffering from hypermotility please check it out , it may help you .	-1
I struggle with IBS-C and have tried many different products to help with the symptoms - without much luck . I tried these pills and so far I have n't noticed any difference in helping with my IBS-C . I get terrible peppermint burps from this product . It has n't worked for me but perhaps it might be different with everyone else .	-1
This product will ease stomach distress for most people . However , for some of us with GERD , it will actually make the symptoms worse . So I wo n't be using it any longer , but let your own body be your guide .	-1
I ca n't see how this product is enteric coated because if that were the case , the pill would n't open up untilit reached the lower part of the digestive system and it seems to start working in the upper digestivesystem way too quickly . It gave me reflux.I would have to say to be really careful if you have reflux and generally I do n't , but I was feeling a burning sensation in my chest after one pill.It also does n't make a lot of sense to be taking this on an empty stomach . I would think if I had taken itin the middle of a meal , it might have gone down with my food and arrived at it 's destination as it should.Trouble was I was scared to take another pill because of the burning in my chest . It took hours to go awayand made me wonder what Heather was thinking in the design of this product !	-1
could be the fennel coz i have a FRUCTAN intolerance so follow a low fodmap diet . It was recommended by a friend who also follows it - saying that it helped her IBS-C symptoms like me and all the reviews made me buy it . been 2 days now and its no good . i always take it first thing when i wake up and stay uncomfortably bloated next couple of hours - i dont know what it is . plus it has gelatin so that is something i didnt know earlier - it doesnt say what kind of gelatin so it could be that despite me being a veg i am ingesting ground animal bones used to make gelatin ?	-1
I 've seen great reviews from others who swear by this product , it just did n't work for me . The burping . I ca n't handle it . It really works with lower GI gas disturbances , if you get my meaning . I have better luck using GasX .	-1
This was n't the fault of the tea . I thought I would try it , but I guess it just did n't light my fire . It sure smells good , though .	-1
did n't work well , sharp edges	-1
Silly to pay a little over six bucks for something you can pick up at the hardware store for about the same price , then pay nearly eight bucks to have it shipped . I will buy local Thanks anyway	-1
I 've bought I do n't know how many of these over time . They work really well for as long as they remain whole . The locking button is hit or miss . On every one I have used , the rubber tips eventually came off and then you lose the screw and it 's done . If you happen to find the screw and put it back on , it wo n't last long . I will try to find something a little more reliable . They are handy for picking things up off the floor if you have a bad back .	-1
This is a very light weight gripper - it ca n't even hold on to a medium size box of cereal.The hinge joint is flimsy and gives way easily.So far it has been most useful for knocking items off a high self.I had one from a dollar store that worked far better - used it so much I finally broke it.I 'm gon na look for another at the dollar store.This one goes to charity .	-1
I was getting some reachers for myself to use after surgery and a coworker asked me to get one for he . I am assuming she likes it but I also got one like this for me and it broke the first time I used it .	-1
I have now purchased two of these grabbers . It is basically a junk product but can be made usable . On each of those which I purchased the rubber cups which do the gripping came off after a few uses . As several of the purchasers noted , there is no apparent way to fix this . On each of mine the plastic inserts in the rubber cups which the original screws fasten into either stripped or broke . However , I fixed mine by replacing the screws with longer sheet metal screws . The new screws go through the cups and hold pretty well . It is still a junk product but it works fairly well as fixed .	-1
This pickup grabber is a piece of crap . Flimsy , wobbly , and grabs only the lightest item if at all . Do n't waste your money .	-1
We irrigate our noses every day with warm salt water and a couple drops of glycerin . ( Buy a container of salt and a little bottle of glycerin and save a fortune ... this recipe is from two ENT doctors ) . I was hoping this would make it easier for my husband but too much comes out at once .	-1
This stuff does n't work at all . I tried it with and without cloth strips . Neither way worked for me and it left my skin feeling awful for days . I had patches of skin missing .	-1
This GIGI Brazillian Body Hard Wax is the worst type of wax that I 've ever used , it 's so sticky and when it dries is hard to remove without leaving traces on the skin , and also is not gentle on the skin at all . I wo n't recommend this product .	-1
After using Sally Hansen Extra Strength Brazilian wax for years i found this wax to be kind of hard to use . I decided to switch to this brand because it does n't require having a microwave like Sally Hansen wax and is a lot cheaper . You will need to purchase a wax warmer to use this wax , metallic container is not safe for the microwave.GIGI Brazilian wax goes on nicely , but very difficult to remove because you have to pick it off . Quite messy and sticky . Not sure how long i 'm supposed to let it dry - very mixed suggestions in other reviews , but if it 's soft it sticks to my fingers and when it dries out completely it gets brittle.Since most reviewers are very happy with this product i tend to think i do n't know what i 'm doing rather than it 's a bad product , will have to revisit this review in few months when i 'm more familiar with this wax. -- -- -- -- -- edit : after a few months with this sticky uncontrollable mess i decided that this particular wax is not for me . Changed rating from 3 stars to 2 because my experience with this product does not get any less annoying	-1
This did n't work for me at all ! It never hardened like it said it would and would n't come off with a strip either . it was just a thick gooie mess .	-1
I am not new to waxing , but have always used Gigi 's soft waxes , for , well , ALMOST everywhere , the all purpose honee being my favorite . I always wax the upper bikini area with no problems , but decided to try this one for the lower part since it has so many positive reviews ( the wax..not my lower parts ; P.First , please know how to use hard , stripless wax . Maybe , be a bit smarter than me and test it out on your leg or something first until you get the hang of it . Now , I have used Gigi microwave stripless wax , and it is nowhere near as sticky as this one . Second , make very sure that you have the oil to remove the wax handy . That 's very important . Very very important . I placed a sticky glob of this wax on a quarter sized area , and it stuck . Like a glue ball . So , after trying to pull it out with no luck , I heated up my soft wax and tried to wax it off that way , which removed about half of it . Then I ended up scraping the rest off in the shower with a cheap razor . Never ever again . I would give this product no stars . None . And give myself no stars for being an idiot as well . If you are going to try this wax , have the oil to remove it handy !	-1
I mistakenly ordered these instead of Playtex Living gloves ( the purple fold over ones ) . However , if you still choose to go with these , make sure you order a size larger - these are truly snug and I have tiny hands ! Playtex Living Gloves , Small , Colors may vary	-1
I ca n't recommend these because my wife says they 're only good for about a month of casual use . They tear trying to put on and the fingers leak very quickly . So caveat emptor !	-1
used it as a filler item . but it was too small for me . my gf and mom used it once in a while . not worth the $ $ in my opinion as dollar shop has it cheaper .	-1
I have large hands , but certainly not the LARGEST hands I 've ever seen by a longshot , yet the & # 34 ; large & # 34 ; size of these rubber gloves can BARELY squeeze onto my hands , after which I ca n't move my thumb ! I threw these Playtex gloves away and bought myself a cheap pair of gloves at the local Walmart . They said & # 34 ; large. & # 34 ; They fit . If you insist on buying this item because you like the brand or something , just be aware that their sizing is way off .	-1
My father and I have dishydrosis , we have to wear gloves to do dishes . These gloves fit very small . They are also rather short , so if you move wrong you will get water in your gloves and defeat the purpose of wearing the gloves ! These are n't bad in a pinch from the grocery store , but I would n't waste my money ordering these off the internet . There are lots of other gloves available , take the time to look for something better !	-1
These are poor quality gloves and , beware , if you are allergic to latex . They are a combination of latex and Neoprene . Note the product description I 've pasted in below . There is NOT a cotton lining . They do fold back to create a cuff to catch drips.These gloves run small . I normally take Medium , and in this glove that size is too tight . I would probably need a Large or even Extra-Large.Product Description : Premium gloves specially blended with natural rubber latex and durable synthetic NeopreneOffers greater resistance against harsh household chemicalsMade with 3 layers to provide added protection against tears and puncturesSuper soft cotton , absorbent lining keeps hands dry and comfortable	-1
Unfortunately , none of the strips in this package worked . I tested and tested . I then resorted to the CVS brand and viola ! Three positives in a row . I confirmed the pregnancy with the doctor . Even though I am two-three weeks along , the Wondfo pregnancy strips still were duds . I say go for the more expensive ones because you know they work .	-1
I used several of these strips on different days to test to see if I was pregnant . They all showed negative , but the test line worked . Which would have been fine , except I was pregnant ! I took other over the counter tests to compare and they were all positive . Then after I had a blood test & an HCG of 2,600 I decided to try another couple of strips to see if it was a fluke ... NOPE ! None of them showed positive ! My whole box was a dud , buyer beware !	-1
Ovulation and Pregnancy Tests HCG Early Detection / B0002YIQLYI thought these were a great deal for the price , but I wo n't be buying them again - for any price.First off , these are different from the `` usual '' pregnancy/ovulation sticks in that you do n't hold them under the urine flow - you instead need to collect the urine in a cup and submerge these very carefully up to a point and let the urine slowly absorb upward . ( And believe me , I tried the `` under the flow '' thing and it just does not work with these . ) This is a personal thing , but I do not enjoy `` cup collection '' and particularly not early in the morning when I 've just woken up.Once you 're collected and the stick is marinating , you 'll notice that these are not terribly precise models . The stick features a single control stripe and ( if positively ovulating/pregnant ) a second indicator stripe - you 're supposed to compare the darkness of the indicator stripe against the control stripe . Problem is , the control stripe ink bleeds everywhere , and what you really get is a `` control blob '' to compare against . The stripes are fairly close to one another in proximity , so it is often extremely hard to tell if the ink blob you are seeing is meant to represent one stripe or two.This situation is *not* helped by the fact that you can get a faint `` false '' indicator stripe on non-ovulation days - ostensibly , you are to compare the darkness of the indicator stripe to the darkness of the control stripe and if the two are n't the same color , then you are n't ovulating yet - you 're just sending off positive hormones . In the first cycle I used these to determine ovulation , I got indicator stripes three days in a row - but as for which day I was *actually* ovulating on was anyone 's guess . Since your ovulation day is your *most* fertile day , this is a big problem , not knowing whether you are ovulating or not.I sort of thought that , if nothing else , these would be good `` training '' strips for anyone interested in their fertility cycle without having to drop a huge wad of cash , but the process is so frustrating and the results are so confusing , that I think these strips do more harm than good . I would n't recommend these and I wo n't be buying them again.~ Ana Mardoll	-1
I had purchased this product as other reviewers seemed confident in its accuracy . After going through nearly the whole pack of ovulation sticks and still no positive result , I began to doubt the ability of the product to be able to detect LH surge . After doing some research and choosing Clearblue easy Digital Ovulation test strips , Clearblue Easy Digital Ovulation Test , 20 CountI waited this this cycle to try testing again and when the signs seemed to point towards ovulation , I tested both these test strips and the Clearblue easy . Clearblue digital gave me a positive LH surge result and the Devon Medical still said negative . As a side note , the product says that if the result line is faint in comparison to the quality control line , that the result is negative . This product DOES give a faint line when tested at the same time that other tests give a positive , so the product does seem to work , but it is n't perhaps as sensitive as others on the market at detecting LH .	-1
Alright so I have PCOS . I took this test today and it showed up negative , so Im pretty happy to see that I dont have straight positives because of elevated LH/FSH.ALSO mine didnt come stuck together as everyone claimed , I had 2 rubber bands at the top of the bundle and the bottom of the bundle of each bundle of test and it came in a plastic wrap bag . It also had the directions inside of it . And they were shipped so fast and I only had standard shipping lol I literally only waited about 2 days ! So far im loving this , I 'll update this post this coming month to see if I get a positive or have any issues with the test. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -Update 8.16.2012These did n't work for me , tried for 2 months , all negative LH test & dr confirmed i ovulated , i tested 2-3 times a day after my period & all negative LH.. not to mention , some were really broken looking , like it broke apart but someone tried to put em back together . I wont buy from again . Thanks anyway . The pregnancy test seem better condition , but ill be buying from someone else .	-1
This item does nothing to keep the toilet clean . We removed it and replaced it with a different brand name product .	-1
This might work for some , but it did not help my toilet stay any cleaner.Do n't think the product contains enough bleach .	-1
Did not work	-1
The description says `` Contains no silicone , linseed oil , or petroleum solvents . Safest way to clean and polish antiques , furniture , cabinets and all other wood surfaces '' . When I received it , the bottle clearly states it contains Petroleum Distillates . Not something I want to use around my small children , back this goes .	-1
After reading the reviews carefully , I decided to try this product for my upper lip and eyebrows . I 'm going to preface my review by saying that I 'm no stranger to waxing/hair removal ; I 've done it myself with an epilator , the muslin strips/microwave melting wax , gone to the salon ... you get the picture . This product did not work at all for me . I purposely did not use my epilator for a few weeks before using this product ... there was certainly enough hair for the wax to hold on to . This wax did not TOUCH the majority of hair on my upper lip . If it removed anything , it removed the finer hair on my lip . Eyebrows ? Do n't even go there.As far as it melting , that 's pretty much a joke as well . For the 2.5 oz . size , the instructions say to microwave for 45 seconds , then at 15 second intervals until it 's *ready* . Well , I tried that for several 15 second bursts , to no avail . Finally , I did three additional 45 second intervals and it was okay . Soft/warm enough to apply.Overall , I ca n't recommend this product . Back to the salon I go , using my epilator/tweezing in between . It 's just not worth the aggravation , time , energy , or money .	-1
I ordered ( 2 ) 100 bag packages of these zip-lock style bags . One arrived fine , but the other one had a 'cut ' thru the ziplock bag they were shipped in ( think 'sliced ' by a box cutter ) . Neither Amazon , or 'Amamax ' ( the seller ) were concerned about this enough , to do anything.The bags 'are thinner ' than I 've boughten before ( from other venders ) . And they are usable , at least once , - reusing them ( reopening & closing ) them several times , may be another matter . And using contaminated bags does n't thrill my wife.I could n't recommend the bags , - or the seller . I 'll not buy these same bags again , or deal with 'Amamax ' the seller again.So , if you buy these bags , - you 'll be buying from a seller who wo n't back up the products they sell , - when there is a problem . Good Luck !	-1
Really have no idea if this is doing anything or not . I certainly ca n't recommend it as I have n't noticed any benefits or negatives associated with it . Definitely have n't noticed any energy boost from it like other people claim.Update 5/14/2014I 've noticed nothing from this expense little bottle , so I ca n't recommend it at all . : (	-1
After having used this product for months , I 'm not sure that I notice any difference . It 's incredibly pricey considering there was no noticeable change in energy or health . When it comes right down to it , it seems like you could probably get the same ( or better ) results by squeezing some lemon juice into some water and drinking that , all for 1/60th of the price at least .	-1
I used the entire bottle of Cellfood and noticed no difference in my energy level or my overall health . My low rating , though , is not because it did n't benefit me ; it 's not unusual for different people to try the same product and experience different results . My low rating is due to what appears to me to be a rather sketchy backstory for this product . I 've done quite a bit of research , and I could find no references to a Nobel laureate named Everett Storey as the company claims . Furthermore , according to courts.ca.gov , 'Everett Storey ' is a trademarked name , & # 34 ; NuScience had been granted trademark registration for & # 8220 ; Cellfood , & # 8221 ; & # 8220 ; Everett Storey , & # 8221 ; and & # 8220 ; Deutrosulfazyme. & # 34 ; Now , companies have been known to make up colorful stories to advertise their products , but if Cellfood is so great , why not tell the truth about its creator ( s ) ? Why make up such an elaborate lie ? I 'm not saying that Cellfood is n't a legitimate product or that it does n't work ; however , its ineffectiveness for me combined with what I learned researching 'Everett Storey ' , make me very skeptical .	-1
After reading a lot of literature about this Cellfood in the nutrition food stores , I decided to order it and see if it would help me ( I am facing a lot of health challenges.. ) First I took only 4 drops in a glass of water ( instead of 8 ) and the taste was so bitter and acid that I contacted the manufacture to find out if it was normal . They answered that this liquid contains some lemon essence ( what is not specified on the label ) ... and that it was not armful for the mouth and stomach . I went to only 3 drops in the morning but I am seriously doubting if it works or not for my body ? The advertising promises marvels for your body but I am very skeptical ... .On the top of that it 's very expensive and I am not sure that the price is justified ...	-1
When I smelled these bars , I knew then that they would probably not good . And I was right . They leave a spoiled milk after taste . Glad I only bought one box !	-1
MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU , BUT REALLY DOES N'T HAVE MUCH TASTE . I 'M EATING THEM . NOT SOMETHING I 'LL EVER ORDER AGAIN .	-1
The ingredients lists hydrogenated oil as one of the ingredients `` partially hydrogenated soybean oil '' .If there is one thing which you have avoid eating , then it is Hydrogenated oil - it is one of the primary cause of Heart disease and Cancer - the # 1 and # 2 killers.It also contains sucralose which is an artificial sweetener ( sucralose is relatively safe , but it is best avoided ) So , please avoid these cookies !	-1
I was compelled to write a review to steer people away from these overpriced and lousy tasting bars . I am someone who loves the taste of green foods , and takes Green Vibrance and wheatgrass every morning . But these Green+ bars have a rather vile taste , with a complete lack of texture that disintegrates into glue in the mouth . Sure , the ingredients list is impressive , but the taste makes them a chore to eat.Steer clear and try the Larabars or Pure Bars , which actually taste wonderful , have less calories , and maintain a vibrant texture from start to finish.These bars are bad ... .And I like healthy green foods . Take my word for it .	-1
I received this today and after spending time hooking it up , reading the directions , all psyched up to use this thing , the serial port connector wo n't fit . I read the book again and find out a mention that it requires a serial port adapter , that is not included . Nowhere was this mentioned in the ordering process that you do n't have all you need to get it going.So I went to two electronic stores in the area and was told the same thing in both places when I showed the clerks this Proteus equipment and the adapter they sent me . They took one look at the 9 pins and informed me this was an OBSOLETE item ! Unusable on any modern computer ( it works only on 10 year old computers ) , and the adapter needed to make it work is n't even available on the market ! I was told even if I found an adapter I would likely have trouble with it using a later model PC.I am just disgusted and have never been so unhappy with an Amazon purchase . I can not comment on the quality of the system itself , the sound/light function , but the 'hardware ' itself is extremely flimsy and cheap . The Proteus device is like a cheap cassette player from the 80s , the headphones equally bottom of the barrel quality.Also the instructions and advice is extremely complicated and confusing . It seems geared to people who are programmers , not the layman.I was thinking of getting a Laxman ( the much upgraded version that is much more expensive , from the same manufacturer ) , but after my experience with this company I just ca n't trust them . Nowhere in the order process was I warned about the need for another device , and that that device might be very hard to find -- ( why the heck would n't they include a usable adapter ? ) .Obviously it is going back tomorrow , but I am sure disappointed , I was looking forward to trying this .	-1
Never got to try . Over the course of almost one month , 23 people attempted to remove the battery cover , to no avail . The manual says to press gently and slide it down . At first I thought it was just me . However , 23 different people ca n't be wrong . None of us was able to get it to budge . Made in China . No wonder ! Back it goes . I give up . Too bad , because I was curious to see if it is as good as my Nova Pro . Several people commented that the entire unit is flimsy and assembled wonky . I 'll post photos to show what I am talking about . Perhaps , I just got a defective machine . I 'm returning it . Too much FRUSTRATION ! BTW , the manual is dated 2006 . I found that a bit disturbing . Reading the manual , the instructions to plug in the headset were incorrect . How much more info in this outdated manual is going to be wrong ?	-1
Zorb worked okay but was work intensive and left a weird film on the carpet . I think the carpet got dirty faster after using it . I 'll just call the carpet cleaners to come and clean instead of using this .	-1
I have to admit I bought this hoping it would clean up some spots on a beige carpet ( two carpets , actually . ) Bottom line , it did n't work on either the plush one or the flat-synthetic Berber type carpet . In addition , it left a residue and an odor ( some kind of perfume . ) Now I feel like I need to clean the carpet with a steam cleaner to get rid of the smell and residue but I 'm going to go with a day or two more drying and then see if it vacuums clean.If it just did not do a good job , I 'd blame it on the age and dirt on the carpet , but I 'm unhappy that it left something behind . It was the equivalent of spraying the carpet with something to try to cover up an odor , as opposed to actually removing any dirt . I had emptied the Dyson before vacuuming up the Zorb and it did NOT pick up anything else , no more hair , no more dirt , just the stuff I 'd put down . ( Which does n't even look dirty after being vacuumed up . ) That 's why I gave it a 1 as in my opinion it did no cleaning and left the carpet worse .	-1
Initially , I tried to vacuum this up with an old Eureka vacuum ( my `` downstairs '' vacuum ) . It did n't work . I could still see tons of Zorb in the carpet . So , I lugged down my upstairs vacuum ( a Shark Rotator with STRONG suction ) , which worked fine . Now , this is n't the products fault -- it 's made specifically for Dysons , which have strong suction . Just a warning , if your vacuum has weak suction , you 're going to be left with what looks like sawdust ground into your carpet.It smells nice . Sometimes carpet products smell terrible , but this one is lovely.But , my main complaint about this product is that I did n't notice a difference . I tried in on three different types and colors of carpet . No change . I thought for sure it would help my cream-colored Berber , but it made zero difference .	-1
These forceps are cheap for a reason . They would bend easily and not hold anything . The good news is that I did n't spend a lot of money on them . The bad news is , they are useless .	-1
This product was very disappointing - like something you would find at a dollar store . It makes a loud noise when pulling and retracting . Has no plastic to cover it during transportation , therefore you get it looking like a chicken fought with it . Lastly , the prestige medical writings is made with cheap ink ( expect it to fall off any minute ) . This product probably cost the manufacturer 50 cents to make , not worth 4 dollars to the public .	-1
I bought the Nicorette Gum to help me stop smoking , it did not help me at all , I had to go and buy the patches instead , and that help me quick smoking	-1
I am not going to place any blame on anything else but me.. But here 's my story , short version.I began smoking when I was 20 ( I am now 22 . ) I am a Marine , and smoking is a way to de-stress myself from the day . I have anxiety , and it 's just a way to calm myself down and relax . ( So unhealthy , I know ! ) My mother has been a smoker my whole life , and encourages me to `` nip the habit in the bud '' while I still `` have a chance . '' ( Just FYI purposes , my dad was a smoker as well and was able to quit . ) For financial and health reasons I decided one day I was going to try the gum . Again , I am not going to blame my unsuccessful story on this product , you CAN NOT quit smoking unless you are completely dedicated.I purchased the gum . I remember telling somebody it was like chewing on shattered glass . It was so harsh on my throat and mouth I dreaded having to chew one . I absolutely hated the taste . The nicotine effects of the gum did nothing to me to help my cravings ; it just did n't replace the fact that I needed a way to de-stress myself.I quit trying after two weeks . Pretty pathetic , but it 's the truth . I just could n't tolerate the gum . I also was n't dedicated in my effort to quit either.. I always put it off for another day . It was such a bummer , considering the $ 30 I paid to purchase the gum.Another bad thing from this product : I actually know people who get addicted to this gum . They replace one habit with another . Now I understand it has to be healthier than smoking itself , but this certain individual would go through a pack of this gum in 4-5 days ! He eventually switched to the generic kind , but was unable to quit . I give him props for being able to quit smoking , but wish that he would quit the gum as well ! I wish you well in your journey to quit smoking . It 's tough , and I hope to do it some day . Please let me know if you have any other suggestions that helped you in the journey of quitting .	-1
I bought these as I was told they would help with adrenal fatigue . I did n't see a positive change when taking these . The change I did see was that it made the blood pressure rise and the vessels in my temple pulse hard . I did not like that at all and cut the dosage to one pill a day and then just stopped taking them .	-1
Ehh , it 's okay if you wan na burp fish taste all day . Did n't really help with I wanted it for but you may have better luck .	-1
I like how it feels while using it . Easy to clean and good ergonomics . The issue is my tongue does n't feel really cleaned and that 's the reason I bought it . It feels just like I ran a spoon down my tongue . I wish I 'd bought another on online and probably will . Too bad I ca n't return it .	-1
I had been cleaning my tongue with a soft regular toothbrush . The reason for purchase was to try this bizarre looking product . I found it ineffective and could potentially scratch/bleed the tongue . Going back to the old way.I do not recommend this product .	-1
One reviewer commented that it has no bite and I have to agree . I get better results from the plastic $ 1.00 scraper I bought from my dentist .	-1
Get the all plastic ones . This metal is sharp and it is uncomfortable to use . I wish I had gotten the all plastic one .	-1
I have cut my tongue several times using this . I know you will say , & # 34 ; well stop scraping so hard moron & # 34 ; . haha . But , I just prefer a plastic one . The steel is to rough for me .	-1
Sorry , but this item was a dud , in my opinion . Poorly designed , not comfortable ( in any position ) , I had forgotten I purchased it until it showed up on my list of purchases , asking for a review . I donated it to our church 's rummage sale .	-1
Biochem Sports Whey Protein Isolate Powder Natural , ingredients : Natural French vanilla flavor , lecithin . xanthan gum , contains milk and soy , 20 gr protein for a serving size of 23.3 gr and costs $ 31.19 for 24.6 oz container . Biochem yields .85 gr of protein for each serving vs. .89 gr of protein for each serving of Now Foods Unflavored Whey Protein Isolate without any chemicals or additives . That missing .04 gr of protein in each serving is substituted with additives . It claims Free of Artificial Hormones Including rBST and rBGH but it is a lie since it is not specified in the ingredients just like Jay Robb proteins which is sold at Whole Foods Stores which claims Sourced from grass fed cows not treated with rBGH on their Internet site but no grass fed cows printed on the labeling . Infact it claims sometimes they do not even have any access to rBGH free on the back panel and use regular milk.I am into many sports and protein isolate is a necessity to me since no beef or chicken for me . I have been consuming whey protein isolate unflavored by Now Foods for last few years in five and ten pound containers and bags . The price has been going up so I tried to see if there is any product compatible exactly to Now Foods isolate . I mean pure whey protein isolate , no additives , no gum , no sweeteners , no additional anything , nothing more than pure protein , no vanilla , no chocolate , just unflavored pure protein.1 . Bob 's Red Mill sells protein concentrate which is not organic but that is great post workout not before workout,2 . Jay Robb proteins which are sold at Whole Foods Stores claims Sourced from grass fed cows not treated with rBGH on their Internet site but no grass fed cows printed on the labeling . Infact it claims sometimes they do not even have any access to rBGH free on the back panel and use regular milk . When I called their offices , no human being answered the phone , instead they put me on hold with some music . It is not made or manufacture in US , it is distributed in US . It has additives , gum , etc . and offers no nutritional information anywhere on its site,3 . Muscle Feast claims 26 gr of protein on Amazon but on the label it claims 24 gr of protein for serving size of 30 gr,4 . Isopure by Nature 's Best has the same plus Ion Exchange Whey ( Milk ) protein Isolate . Ion Exchange requires heat and chemical which kills nutrients in comparison to Microfiltered Whey Protein Isolate ( milk ) ,5 . Now Foods Organic Unflavored Whey Protein is the best but it is concentrate not isolate and once again organic . Now Foods prints on the label Manufactured by NOW FOODS , Made in the U.S.A. and others claim distributed in US . Making is not the same as distributing.The reality is that 10 lb of isoNatural will cost $ 202.86 , when it should not cost me more than $ 94 for a ten lb bag . Thanks but no thanks . No need to get anything from any distributor hiding somewhere in Canada or even US without proper labeling , clear information , ingredients , nutritional value , contact information including phone number , email address and physical address of their business . I want it made in US not distributed in US . The sad part of their whole strategy is they want to charge more for their questionable practices . An absolute joke.Biochem is sold at Now Foods Stores as well which is the lesser quality protein with additives . That is some serious marketing . No wonder they inspire the average Joe to pay more for less at Whole Foods Stores .	-1
I bought this Battery from someone else 's review , they never worked , at first I thought my flashlight was broken until I tried a battery from a friend and realized the battery was no good .	-1
The product fits poorly and is extremely poorly made . The clip on tabs are tiny and will not last . I am going to retun this product . It is pretty much useless .	-1
I buy everything I review . To receive FIVE stars , a product must meet & # 62 ; 90 % of the manufacturer 's claims . I don & # 8217 ; t subtract because I don & # 8217 ; t like the color or appearance ( too subjective and personal ) . I review form , function , ease of use , and construction quality . Please forgive typos : I & # 8217 ; m an evidence-based scientist , NOT a typist . If you find my review helpful , please click & # 34 ; YES & # 34 ; . This helps me improve future evaluations ( which I do for free to help people make more informed decisions ) .Their Claim : Good source or proteinMy Verdict ( details below ) : True ( but with a catch ) At $ 1.25/bar , these are CHEAP in the world of protein bars.They contain 20 grams of protein/bar , most of any I 've tried . The chocolate mint flavor is great , and it has a crispy texture , which is not too chewy . The best tasting bar I 've ever had , and I 've tried plenty . That 's of course subjective , but if you like chocolate mint , I ca n't believe you would n't like this product 's taste.Here 's the ingredient list : IngredientsSoy Protein Isolate , Chicory Syrup , Organic Brown Rice Syrup , Organic Evaporated Cane Juice , Palm Kernel Oil , Unsweetened Chocolate , Organic Rolled Oats , Cocoa , Organic Soy Protein Concentrate , Organic Sunflower Oil , Vegetable Glycerin , Natural Flavors , Organic Dry Roasted Almonds , Rice Starch , Evaporated Cane Juice , Inulin ( Chicory Extract ) , Cocoa Butter , Organic Milled Flaxseed , Organic Oat Fiber , Soy Lecithin , Salt , Red Cabbage Color . Vitamins & Minerals : Dicalcium Phosphate , Magnesium Oxide , Ascorbic Acid ( Vit . C ) , Tocopheryl Acetate ( Vit . E ) , Ferric Orthophosphate ( Iron ) , Beta Carotene ( Vit . A ) , Zinc Citrate , Phytonadione ( Vit . K1 ) , Biotin , Niacinamide ( Vit . B3 ) , Calcium Pantothenate ( Vit .

B9 ) , Riboflavin ( Vit . B2 ) , Pyridoxine Hydrochloride ( Vit . B6 ) .Wow , that 's a LOT of crap in there . And # 5 is palm kernel oil , one of the worst oils in the world as it is a highly saturated fat . They could have used peanut oil , but they chose the worst of the bunch . I do n't understand that type of choice.If you want protein , this is a good bar . If you want to protect your arteries , look elsewhere . It 's a shame because they taste so GOOD and are affordable.The QUEST bar remains the gold standard . For those , nuke them about 30 seconds and they taste like a moist brownie.I wish these did n't have PKO . But they do , so I wo n't be buying more . Luna bars also have PKO . For some reason , they 're not listening to nutritionists about the harmful effects of these saturated fats .	-1
It 's absolutely ridiculous that they would sell this crap to people trying to get in shape.If you look at the nutrition facts , you see that for every 20g of protein you also get 20g of sugar ! Do n't take my word for it , do your research and find out why too much sugar is bad.There are MANY other brands out there that have a protein to sugar ratio of about 2:1 or even up to 3.5:1It is worth mentioning that the company is so deceitful that they actually HIDE the sugar content in nutrition facts ( on the amazon product page ) avoid this at all costs as this is not even that cheap to be a good deal .	-1
I eat a lot of protein bars , and am a big fan of clif 's mojo ones , but these taste like straight up chemicals . There is no eating half and saving the rest for later either , as the bar will desiccate into a small sliver of the sahara . Maybe it 's the flavor , but I would save your money on these : /	-1
This item arrived and it was not past it 's due date ... but it sure tasted like it was ! It did not taste like vanilla or almond . It was more like a chalky , powdered whey flavor with a layer of goo on top . The worst bar I have ever had . I 've tried and enjoyed many bars , even the less palate-friendly high-protein ones . Thumbs down to the vanilla almond !	-1
It is very nice lotion but if you are sensitive to smells , you may not like it . My friend said it is the arnica that gives it a particular and strong smell . So bare in mind if this matters to you .	-1
Smell is a little talcum powderish . I do n't like it . Glide is good , but the chemicals in this cream bother me a lot . I got some in my mouth by accident and it was ... yeeeccch . My new motto . `` If it ca n't go in your body , I 'm not putting it on your body . '' I 'll not use this again .	-1
I love this massage cream and it is well worth the price but mine came with the creme oozing out of the jar and no longer fluffy and white but more yellow and lumpy . I would be careful of buying this in the summer . I will keep the item because it still works okay and I feel like it was my own fault for being so stupid as to order it in the summer . i think it melted in transport because I was home and brought it inside as soon as it was delivered . Otherwise it is a 5 star product .	-1
I have used this device for 5 days now , and have found that simply stretching against a wall is a much more effective way to loosen tight calf muscles which led to my plantar fasciitis . I also find the device incredibly painful against the heel while performing the stretches due to the plastic backing digging into the foot . A much better use of your money would be a tennis ball to roll out your calf muscles .	-1
This product is designed to elevate your forefoot , which stretches your calves . It is often used in physical therapy settings because it is dummy-proof : the PT can leave the patient with their foot in the right position for stretching and do something else , assured that the patient wo n't mess up the stretch.There is nothing magical or special about this stretching device that makes it better for stretching your calves than a regular calf stretch . In fact , regular calf stretches generally do a better job , as you can control the amount of stretch you give yourself , while with this device , the level of forefoot elevation is fixed.The rocking aspect of the device is fairly useless as well . If you want to use the device for stretching , the rocking wo n't help any , as you need a sustained lengthening of the muscle for the stretch to be effective . If you want to use it as a range-of-motion warm-up exercise ( rocking back and forth to warm up the muscles ) , the elevated forefoot limits plantarflexion ( toe pointing ) , making it ineffective at that as well . You would be better served just raising your forefoot off the floor , then your heels , and repeating until you are warmed up.Please people , do n't spend 50+ dollars on this unnecessary device . If you have a curb , a wall , a brick , or even a block of wood you can elevate your forefoot and get the same stretch for free .	-1
Wow ! To say I was underwhelmed would be , well , an underwhelming understatement.This tool is VERY sturdy , made of rigid plastic . It 's very well made.And , it DOES do a VERY good job of stretching the calf.HOWEVER , anyone giving this thing glowing reviews isn't/has n't been a competitive athlete . Why ? YOU CAN GET EXACTLY THE SAME STRETCH - IF NOT DEEPER - doing standard hamstring and calf stretches leaning into the wall.THIS IS WHY I 'm under whelmed . It 's no different than doing standard static stretches.As for plantar fasciatis relief , which I was hoping for , it SUCKS for stretching the fascia . The instructions read , `` The plantar fascia is stretched by default when doing the exercises . `` Seriously , YOU 'RE MUCH , MUCH better off just grabbing your foot in one hand , and pulling your toes/ball of your foot up HARD , and holding your heel in the other to stretch your plantar fascia.Again , it 's a well made device . But I 've returned it ; because I have enough stuff lying around that serves no real purpose other than someone thought of way to make something to fix a problem that does n't exist.Good luck .	-1
Theraband is a good product . I 've used it in PT and purchased before on line . Blue was not available so I purchased medium red . Upon first use it broke but works okay with doubling . Please make blue available and I will buy .	-1
I used the red bar and green bar for weeks but I did not get any improvement . I suppose it works for some people .	-1
this really did nothing for my tennis elbow ... .it really did nothing for my entire arm ... .i was very unimpressed and returned it ... .	-1
I did n't take this product long enough to experience any benefits but 1-2 weeks after taking this I had broken out in painful , devastating ( people would actually ask me what was wrong with my face ) acne along my chin , jawline , and neck . It was the worst breakout of my life ( I 'm 26 ) and it took a couple of weeks to start to calm down . From my googling ( CLA + acne ) it looks like this is a fairly common occurrence . Beware !	-1
Iron Tek Essential Cla Seems to be weak . Does not work as well as other brands . Would not buy again .	-1
Works as specified but like all their products it is insanely overpriced . It 's just a cut-off piece of rubber bar and their other products are just strips of rubber sheet . Amazing they get away with it .	-1
I followed the directions and even watched a vid from the company on Youtube on exactly how to use these . It just made the situation worse . Oh , well.Plus I ordered a few of these in different strengths ... ..they all reek of new rubber smell that does NOT go away . Geez .	-1
Other reviewers were right here ... After a few months they start to pull the hair ( went dull I guess ) . They say do not oil ... so I did n't . Just threw them out and just purchased another brand that had higher ratings .	-1
I believe the guides were designed to break . On one side of the plastic comb guide there is a ridge to hold the comb guide in place on the shaver , and on the other side over half of the plastic ridge has been cut away so that there is just a small sliver of plastic to hold the comb guide in place . Once that piece breaks off - and it will - the comb will not stay on the shaver , and therefor , the shaver is useless for cutting that hair length . All of the guides are designed this way - to break . Notice the other reviews of folks looking to replace their broken comb guides . Shameless , that a company would do this . Stay away from this product.The only reason you could possibly want this is if you only used the shaver without the guides . You know , to shave practically bald .	-1
I had bought this in the hopes of removing the adhesive left over from the labels on my medicine bottles ... notice I said HOPE. # 1 ) this stuff DID NOT do anything to remove the adhesive ... I soaked a rag , left it on the adhesive for about 5 - 10 minutes ; I soaked the ENTIRE bottle in the stuff ; I scrubbed like crazy with a rag soaked in Goo Gone ... nothing.I could understand it if I was trying to remove paint from some surface , but I was not . All I wanted , was to remove the adhesive from my medicine bottles as I reuse them for all sorts of storage type needs. # 2 ) with the experience I have had with this stuff , I believe it to be way over priced & a total waste of my time & money . I will NEVER recommend this product . I am just totally miffed at this product.I do not however , blame the seller . He/She is just trying to make a buck to feed himself/herself & their family ... I refuse to hold this bad experience against the seller.My advice for anyone wanting/needing this type of product : buy something else besides Goo Gone .	-1
Not quite DOA - it actually ran , very noisily , for several minutes before dying permanently . Not worth returning , just goes into the landfill . Also , the worst imaginable clamshell packaging , the kind Amazon has vowed to eliminate - THANK YOU AMAZON for vowing that - that packaging is HORRIBLE to try to get open , and will give future archaeologists , if any survive , nightmares about what their ancestors must have thought they were doing !	-1
Wo n't run on NiMH rechargable batteries ( I use Eneloop , awesome batteries ) . Drains even quality alkalines really fast ( I can get like two sessions out of a set , whereas my Braun Pocketgo shaver will last for a couple months and runs fine with my Eneloops ) . Does n't have a lot of power . I got a haircut the other day and I do n't know what brand of trimmer they used but it was about the same size , battery operated and it was an amazing difference . This piece does n't even begin to compare . Do not buy !	-1
Wahl 9916-817 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer did not meet my expectations . I tried using once and found it lacking , the head is not wide enough for my taste . It is sitting in my bottom drawer not being used and I really can & # 8217 ; t recommend .	-1
On this trimmer the blade attachments are very hard to get on and off . I 'm surprised I have n't broken one yet . Without an attachment it is very sharp and the edges cut you if you are not careful .	-1
Avoid This ProductDoing research on the internet you find out this is dangerous for for use . But I found out after buying it , they should have a warning but they do not . I flushed it and never used it even at this price , I wasnt about to take anything . Do your research avoid .	-1
Wheres the warning that says yeah it will neutralize , acetamiphen but will cause kidney stones , if you do n't take crazy amounts of vitamin c	-1
Pretty sure this is just fillers , or maybe it 's jsut me but it did nothing for what I used it for .	-1
Did n't work for me . But if you take it with Theanine , it adds a litlle sensation of relaxation to L Theanine . But just the Gaba by itself does n't result . At least in my case .	-1
These pills taste more like oregano than garlic though it is allegedly 440mg garlic and 150 oregano.. and are not enteric gelcaps like I prefer for garlic intake . you might start burping after taking them . Going to go toss this in the trash now by the way .	-1
Turns out I 'm allergic to wheat grass . I sprouted an incredible itchy rash that woke me up several times a night after just one of these smoothies . I guess they are not for everyone .	-1
I tried this to see if it would help me ( notice I said me ) with my high blood pressure . Nope ! No help at all . No changes in my blood pressure after 2 bottles .	-1
I have taken this product for 8 weeks and have not seen a difference . Maybe you need to take it longer . Very disappointed I did n't lose any weight .	-1
There does not seem to be any benefit to taking this supplement . I feel no different in any way . It may just be this brand . If you are insistant on CoQ10 , try another brand or different strength . I would not buy this again , or recommend .	-1
container looks same as on picture but it does not contain any chewable tablets at all ... it does not taste mint neither .	-1
I purchased these for a healthy alternative for gums and mints . They are not the best tasting but decent the biggest complaint I have is that they leave little crumbles when chewing them . What are crumbles ? They are the kind that get caught in your throat and make you cough and choke . My co workers know me for always having mints or gum when I used to give them these they thought I was crazy because they tasted gross and are chalky . I did not find the taste gross but the chalky part was the killer for me . Only one other co worker did not find them gross but he was known for eating healthy bland food . The only reason i gave two stars instead of one is cause of the bulk amount of mints , the healthy alternative , and the taste was decent .	-1
I 've used garlic oil soft gels for some time and have had various brands . The Swanson product may be perfectly fine ; however , I returned it . The reason for the return was that I got a strong garlic smell without even opening the bottle . If you do n't mind the smell , the Swanson garlic oil may be OK . However , I prefer truly odor-free garlic oil and have found that it is readily available in other brands .	-1
So many supplements claim to help with this chronic ailment or that and this is yet another that does not deliver .	-1
I have taken DHEA before but this one causes severe problems with my heart and should not be sold any where until it is proven safe to use . I have use supplements for 30 years and have run into few products that are as bad as this one .	-1
This contains 1000 mcg of B12..you can get B12 cheaper . I took this and noticed no improvement whatsoever . It tastes really sweet so taste was not a problem , but I needed the selenium and zinc and there 's not enough in it to be effective . I gave it two stars for the flavor , otherwise I wo n't be buying again .	-1
It did n't give me any energy what so ever . I 'm still taking until i finish the bottle . very disappointed ; (	-1
I just finished my bottle of this stuff and saw no difference in my hair . So I 've gone on to something else . Still trying to find something to keep my hair from breaking , drying and brittle . Anyone have any suggestions please post . Although I heard concentrate Trace Mineral is suppose to be good , I 'll post a post there since I did buy a bottle of that .	-1
I take melatonin regularly for sleep and I thought it would be great to have it on subscribe and save . It does not indicate in the description that it also has vitamin B6 in it . Each 3mg tablet has 500 % of your daily requirement of vitamin B6 in it . Which means if you 're like me and take at least one a day you 're going to quickly run into far more B6 than your body needs.If you only use it ( melatonin ) occassionally I 'm sure a little extra B6 never hurt anyone but if you take it ( melatonin ) regularly I would n't recommend this formulation .	-1
This takes too long to get me sleepy and it taste horribly so do not chew it . When it finally makes me sleepy , it 's not a sound sleep . Will not be purchasing this brand again	-1
I felt so drugged it seemed like I was in prescription drugs . Later I read on line that Valerian root is toxic.I found that Passion flower is better b/c it calms u and gives u peaceful feeling which in turn helps u sleep amazing well .	-1
I bought this product for my husband . He told me it did n't work any better anything else . We wo n't be purchasing this preoduct again . I do hope it works for other people .	-1
I took this like it said , 5 capsules . It kept me up all night long ! Had to get up early for work ( 4 a.m. early ) exhausted . Afraid to try again and get the same results . I had a brand called Radiance though .	-1
`` super-charged oxygen '' ? `` reconfigured electrical flow '' ? Is there nothing people wo n't believe ? That third line is mine , but I suspect that the inventor of these water bottles must have asked himself the same thing .	-1
Vitamin `` O '' sounds a lot like ( regular ) Hydrogen Peroxide.I dunno ... Anyways if you 're oxygenating your body , make sure to take antioxidants , *as `` oxygen '' does not discriminate between disease-causing cells , bacteria , & viruses and healthy cells , and will destroy either one .	-1
I am pretty disappointed . The shipping took a lil over 2 weeks , and after I finally received them , after a weeks use , I did n't notice any kind of tired/relaxed feeling . At least these did n't cost me too much : (	-1
I felt horrible for hours after i took just 1 cap . Nothing bad to say about Swanson products because this is some really potent stuff . I dont think ive ever felt so strung out after taking a supplement or drug . The side effects are just insane . Its like a bad lsd trip with a bunch of caffeine . I did notice a significant sexual boost but due to the side effects it 's not even worth it .	-1
I made a mistake and purchased Swanson 's Yohimbe ( extract ) instead of Swanson 's Yohimbe Bark . The bark in one capsule dose was relatively mild and not always efficacious . The Yohimbe extract is a different beast altogether . Thinking I was taking the bark , I swallowed an entire capsule . Suddenly , I had the worst heart palpitations in my life . I felt like I was sprinting but sitting down did n't stop the racing heart . After about 30-40 minutes of utter fear , I realized that death was not imminent , and calmed down , but not nearly enough to enjoy a night 's sleep.Someone online with the same problem suggested taking the capsule apart and using the powder that remained in the smaller capsule end . This created similar problems but not nearly as scary . The reason I am not giving this product a single star is because a quarter of a capsule really works ! But there have been times when I have become lightheaded and nauseous before breaking out into a heavy cold sweat . This has happened three or four times . A night 's sleep afterwards is nothing but fits and starts , maybe three hours out of seven in bed actually asleep.I have recently found a better product with similar but less intense side effects . Yohimbe Bark Extract - Standardized to 3 % Yohimbine HCL - 100 mg x 100 Capsules by Real Herbs . At $ 29 for 100 tiny capsules , it is much more expensive than Swanson 's , but the experience is not nearly as scary . The Real Herbs extract is standardized to 3 % vs 2 % for Swanson 's . Where the Swanson 's is a 500 mg capsule amount , the Real Herbs is only 100mg . Since I used only a quarter of the Swanson 's cap , the amount ingested was about 125 mg for the Swanson 's vs. 100mg for the Real Herbs caps . This makes the Real Herbs almost 4 X as expensive , but since the cost per capsule comes out to only twenty-nine cents each , I 'm not about to complain . In fact , I would highly recommend to Swanson 's that they pack their fire-powder into 100 mg mini-capsules to avoid causing someone an untimely death.One last point , the Swanson 's gives an erection with a life of its own . This is great if your mind tends to wander , but is also a bit less rewarding than a natural hard-on . By contrast , the Real Herbs extract produces an erection that feels like its part of you instead an attachment . May not be as foolproof , but it feels more like yourself .	-1
My body is fairly tolerant to stimulants , so I did n't experience the degree of negative effects most people seem to , but it still was n't good . It just made the whole experience ... weird . For one , once it kicked in I became cold and clammy to the extent that I did n't particularly want to be touched . Once things got going I got really into it but before long I started to feel & # 34 ; disconnected & # 34 ; from the sensation . Then , about halfway through , the sensation kicked in overdrive and I was really enjoying it up until I was surprised by a completely unexpected , anticlimactic finish . It just left me feeling drained and somewhat confused as to how it ended so abruptly . Maybe I 'll give it another try with just half a capsule .	-1
This is the second brand of pygeum I 've used . I had no trouble with the first brand , Nature 's Way , but this brand causes me a lot of stomach pain . I 've taken it with food and without food , but whether I take two capsules or only one , my stomach ends up hurting for hours .	-1
I took for a month . I did not notice any difference . A waste of money . I was n't looking to climb mt . Everest ... just a little more energy . Save your money	-1
this stuff gave me hprrible heartburn . d not buy if you value your chest being normal . I do NOT reccommend .	-1
I bought this because I read that Hawthorn Berries would help lower blood pressure . Mine is not seriously high so I thought it might lower it a few points . Does n't seem to have , though . I fill finish taking what I have , but I will not waste any more money on it .	-1
I bought these to supplement my dogs Urinary track problems . I would cut the tip off and squeeze the insides into her food because she would not eat the capsule . I do not know if these were old or just the way they were supposed to be but I did not like the appearance of the insides of the capsule . I have bought Cranberry supplements for my dog before and I tasted it and it was pure cranberry concentrate but this was nasty . It was a brownish glob . Maybe that is the way this brand was to be but I will not buy again . I will stay with my other kind .	-1
This brand of Gingko Biloba does not seem to be as devoid of Gingko toxin as the slightly more expensive brands on Amazon . These toxins exacerbate the effects of epilepsy , and cause a significant mind fog . This brand does improve memory noticeably , however , the side effects of Gingko toxins ( e.g . diarrhea , mind fog , seizures ) are far more prevalent than what I have noticed from the more reputable brands .	-1
Some scientific studies have shown that 320 mg daily of standardized saw palmetto extract may be effective in decreasing the symptoms of benign prostate hyperplasia ( BPH ) . This product offering is not an effective dose as noted by one other reviewer . The standardized extracts are what you need to buy in order to get an effective dose.The best price for the right stuff currently ( 02/29/12 ) is for the Doctor 's Best productDoctor 's Best Best Saw Palmetto Extract ( 320 mg ) , Softgel Capsules , 60-Countfor $ 7.73 . In addition , Amazon offers the Doctor 's Best Product in their subscribe and save program for an additional 15 % discount . The similar Swanson productSaw Palmetto 320 mg 60 Sgelsis more expensive especially considering shipping.In simple terms BPH means that the prostate is enlarged and slowing down the male urinary stream . The downside of taking saw palmetto is that it should not be an excuse for avoiding an exam and discussion with your doctor . For example an exam and blood test may be needed to rule out prostate cancer . So man up and see your doctor if you have urinary symptoms that might be BPH or might be cancer . That done you can consider whether to take saw palmetto	-1
I have taken this for 5 days now and after developing heartburn that nothing can tame , and abdominal pain I did more research into this product . Those are pretty standard side effects for this.So the dosage listed is two capsules , twice daily which amounts to 2 grams of pure bark . Most studies have shown that 50-100mg of standardized pygeum extract daily is the effective dose , however since this is just straight bark , it 's difficult to know how much of the active components you are getting.Basically , I 'm going to stop taking this preparation , and find something that is a standardized extract and see if I get the same side effects . This could be a fine product , but I think the quantity they want you to take is too much .	-1
I have used stevia in multiple forms since the early 1990 's and never knew it could taste so bad ! If you have never had stevia do not assume this is how it tastes . Try Stevita or sweetleaf . This is inferior to those brands in all ways - taste , mixability , amount needed to get the same sweetness . Not worth the price difference .	-1
I have moderately high blood pressure that is managed with prescription medication.I bought this product because I need to reduce inflammation and turmeric is known to be beneficial for cardiovascular health , even potentially lowering blood pressure . I took 2 caplets as directed ; within an hour my blood pressure shot up to 188/106 ! It has NEVER in my life been that high . PLEASE , if you have HBP , get your doctor 's OK first before using this product ( admittedly , as I should have done . )	-1
I hoped it would work for me , but I did n't feel or see any difference . I know Tumeric works for others , so maybe I just need something else . Good luck	-1
I do n't seem to be any smarter as a result of taking this product . Bummer ! I was really expecting to become a genius just by taking a few pills , but alas it 's not to be . Maybe I should spend my hard earned money on a visit to a fortune teller . I 've heard they will promise to tell you the winning MegaMillion lottery numbers for a few sheckles . Besides I 'm tired of taking pills for no reason .	-1
Yes , Tumeric is a wonder supplement . It is AMAZING for inflammation in the human body . But , it 's the curcuminoids that do the healing . The `` whole root '' powder is just a backdoor way of saying that it 's mostly filler . In the description , it says 3-6 % curcuminoids . Folks , that 's a joke . This has virtually no healing powers at all . All you 're getting from this supplement is filler tumeric compounds , such as fiber and starches that bring no benefit to you whatsoever . I 'm amazed that Swanson would put out such a cheap , ineffective supplement.If you want to get a REAL Tumeric Supplement , look at some of the more expensive Tumeric supplements on here . There are some supplements that have as high as 95 % curcuminoids . And yes , they 're 3-4x more expensive , but that will actually do something for you . Anyone who is experiencing benefits from this supplement is more than likely having a placebo effect , since there 's really nothing beneficial in this product at all.Sorry to burst the bubbles of those interested in buying this cheap knockoff Tumeric product , but someone had to blow the whistle .	-1
I bought these for my tendonitis and carpel tunnel . I have read about the amazing benefits of using turmeric but unfortunately these made me feel horrible ! I had terrible gastrointestinal pain . I had read that some people may experience this and unfortunately I was one of them . When I tried to return them , I was told basically that its not their problem if I had stomach issues : (	-1
A bit of background : I was n't very far onto the homeopathic treatment bandwagon , but I was shopping at a tea stand at the farmer 's market and said , `` Mmm , this tea smells nice . '' The tea seller replied , `` Oh , that 's one of my favorites ! It 's good for allergies , too ! `` Sold.Lo and behold , it WAS good for allergies . Noticeably so ! Furthermore , my chronic injury was bothering me a LOT less . Astounded , I did some research , and found some reputable studies ( read : peer-reviewed in science or medical journals ) which showed that stinging nettle helps with inflammation . This made sense of my tea experience , and I went shopping for more nettles teas , as the farmer 's market stuff was too expensive for everyday use . ( Alas , 2 out of 2 commercially packaged nettle teas were incredibly gross . I now get dried nettles in a local health food store for less than $ 2/liter , and that makes a LOT of tea ) .Now , I fill my little tea strainer basket all the way to the top , then steep myAdagio Teas PersonaliTea 24-Ounce Ceramic Teapot with Infuser Basketfor at least 15 minutes , then drink it . Drinking it too fast can lead to nausea , which is odd , since the tea tastes overly vegetable but not at all bad . Relief is often ( but not always ) noticeable , but I like actual tea better than medicinal tea , so this practice gets old.So I bought these things ! And I 'm trying . But I do n't think the dose is high enough , as I ca n't determine any difference at all . Ah , well : back to the drawing board ! Update : How silly of me ! A little more research , and I have it on homeopathic authority that stinging nettle ROOT is to make you pee . Apparently only the above-ground bits are for allergies , arthritis , or general inflammation . Whoops ! As with anything of this nature , do n't take my word or the word of any stranger on the internet ! Go ask a medical professional , and be healthy !	-1
I thought this health product would help me with my sinus problem , or runny nose , but it did n't . I figured it would drain it or something since this is a diuretic , but the only thing it did was make my feces come out drier than usual . But in all actuality this may be a product that does work . I just possibly wanted it to do something that it was n't made to do .	-1
Anyone who has done research on Green Tea knows that EGCG is one of the main benefits of taking a Green Tea supplement . Sure , if you 're DRINKING Green Tea ( such as Matcha ) , you 're also getting chlorophyll . But a normal Green Tea supplement , you want 40-50 % EGCG . I love Swanson ( amazing company ) , but they sometimes put out supplements that are dirt cheap , just to appease the people on a shoestring budget.What you should be looking for in a Green Tea supplement is for it to be standardized with AT LEAST 40 % EGCG , if not 50 % . Find a product with 50 % EGCG , take 2-4 capsules/tablets a day , and you have a supplement that 's more effective against the Flu than the Flu Shot . Sadly , this Green Tea supplement does n't contain any EGCG whatsoever . If it does , it 's probably 1-2 % or less.I know this is cheap and looks attractive , but you 're better off paying an extra $ 8-10 or so , and getting a REAL formula . I 'm all about maximizing your supplement intake , and this product is one that should be in the trash bin.My recommendations : either drink Matcha Green Tea ( preferably organic ) , or get a supplement that reveals the EGCG content of the formula . A quality supplement will be 50 % EGCG and is usually 200mg of EGCG , which is the equivalent of 2 cups of green tea . If you 're drinking a good quality Matcha , EGCG content is about 61 % and a cup of Matcha Green Tea has about 180-240mg of EGCG .	-1
i did not see any changes in my weight or energy.i guess drinking the tea is much better . it sucks	-1
This product is good , smells like tea very strong . Unfortunately , if you have sensitivity to green tea , you most likely will have it to these . I wanted a way to get the benifits without drinking it because I have sensitivity to it . I also read that tea supplements are better because you get the full dose in one pill . Well , this got me wired . If you can handle green tea , these are great .	-1
I ordered this as a natural ingredient for my back inflammation but unfortunately after using for 2 1/2 months there was no improvement . It was packaged secure and arrived as stated .	-1
I was n't able to use this product right away . The few times I did , I did NOT get the results that are shown on TV . Way over-priced . I was scammed and now that it 's passed the 30 days I can not return it or get some kind of price adjustment . I would suggest buying X-14 and get better results for a lot less money .	-1
I purchased a stand Identical for less than a dollar . Save the ten spot and put it towards a good metal one or find the other vender with a reasonable price .	-1
This stand is supposed to hold a shaving brush . but it has a nasty habit of falling overeasily . Spend a little more money and get a chrome stand . Since it will be used every day , you wo n't be sorry .	-1
I do n't know what happened , normally we love CA Baby products but this is a big failure . The smell is nothing like lavender , it smells like bad medicine . It 's oddly sticky and leaves a film behind on my daughter 's hair . I 've tried it twice , just to make sure I was n't imagining it the first time , as I 'm shocked that CA Baby put out this product . Both times , I needed to wash it out . It 's gross . I 'll also mention that it came to me leaking in the box , not good packaging .	-1
I 've used these in my pager with OK results ; they would probably be OK in wall clocks or flashlights , but they are lousy in digital cameras . I tried some in myOlympus D-580 4MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoomand I was able to take maybe 3 or 4 pictures before the camera thought the batteries were dead . If I waited a while , it could take a few more pictures.I dug out my voltmeter , and it confirmed it . These batteries went from 1.6 volts down to 1.4 volts after a few shots in the camera . After 30 minutes , they recovered to 1.5 volts . The same test with standard Everready alkaline batteries dropped the voltage to only 1.5 volts , plenty of picture-taking power left , and they recovered back to 1.6 volts .	-1
If you want to ruin your special clothing then use this product . I was extremely disappointed to say the least when my favorite items came out of the dryer with irremovable SPOTS . It does n't compare to dryel which I have never had a problem with . Do n't waste your money on this item .	-1
This is a duplicate review , as this device is listed in a couple of places on Amazon . I had high hopes for this thermometer , after reading a medical article comparing it with standard mercury ( Hg ) thermometers in a clinical trial . All the accuracy , but without the significant health risks if it breaks . Well , I still have an `` old fashioned '' Hg thermometer , in addition to an electronic probe and an ear device from a major manufacturer ( for the home , not professional market ) .When I purchased this , I compared it to the Hg thermometer , since I have one and I was curious about the new Hg substitute . First , I put them both under my tongue simultaneously . This one read about 2 degrees lower than the Hg standard . I thought that its larger size might have allowed air to get by my lips & cool it . I then did two back-to-back measurements ; Geratherm , Hg ; Geratherm , Hg . Four minutes each , all at rest , one immediately after the other , and always placing them in the same location . Both devices were `` internally '' consistent - that is the Hg gave the same temp both times , sequentially , as did the Geratherm . So far , so good . Consistency is necessary in a measuring instrument . HOWEVER , on both occasions the Geratherm now measured a full two ( 2 ) degrees HIGHER than the Hg ! NOT good ! I then checked my temp using the oral electronic probe ; it was 0.2 degrees off from the Hg . I then used the ear probe ( both ears ) and surprisingly it , too , was actually very close to the Hg ( 0.2 degrees difference between the 2 ears ; average 0.3 degrees off from Hg , just a bit lower otic ( ear ) than oral ) .For this reason , I 'm returning it , and I 'm going to try another one . I suspect that it 's a manufacturing defect explained by the construction of this thermometer - it 's a glass tube within a second glass housing , and there 's a paper scale behind the capillary tube containing the liquid . If that paper is not placed properly , the reading will be `` off . '' The device 's consistency suggests that the liquid expanded properly & consistently in response to my temp . My old Hg thermometer has the typical printing on the glass . Sure , that could be off , but those devices have been standardized over decades . And the good correlation with other devices ( particularly the electronic probe , which I 've calibrated against known standards - freezing & boiling water , & it 's accurate ) suggests that my old thermometer is the correct one.Other comments - I did n't find it particularly worse than the old standard to `` shake down ; '' each took the same # of shakes to return to baseline . If one does have arthritis , neither this nor a mercury thermometer are easy to use , and you 're probably best off with a high rated electronic probe . Also , the outer glass housing is much larger ( about 3X ) the size of the Hg thermometer , which made it a little more cumbersome to hold under the tongue , but not impossible . Because of its size , I do n't think it would be particularly good for a child under about age 7-8.Hope this helps other users . I am concerned about this , especially as a medical professional , because not everyone has a mercury thermometer to compare against . This 2 degree difference could mean a LOT if you 're using this in a `` sick '' situation ( e.g . deciding if your older child can go to school or not ) . I plan on contacting the manufacturer about this .	-1
This liquid bandage is no replacement for the real deal . It stings like crazy on wounds , takes up to 15 minutes to dry , and reeks of nail polish remover . Finally , the `` bandage '' does not hold up well to water or movement . After drying , the bandage layer is prone to peeling off , exposing the wound anew . Serious bleeding just bursts through through the thin , flimsy layer .	-1
These are an off brand of bandaids and they have lost their stickiness , so they come right off in a hurry . I bought them for small cracks in the ends of my fingers and they are really useless .	-1
Not nearly as good as Band-Aid brand which I ca n't find anymore . The adhesive is not good and they only stick for about 5 minutes	-1
after a day in a 0F freezer , these remain flexible but only able to hold cold for 10 minutes . that may be useful for an athlete cooling a sore ankle or wrist after muscle fatigue , but it 's useless to anyone using these to reduce swelling . the thin cotton coat did n't really matter since these wo n't stay cold long enough to cold burn you anyway . I have swelling from hip surgery , so I use one slipped down into my pant pocket after a long walk - a pretty useless application , but it 's better than nothing .	-1
I have tried a number of different lubricants over the years ; all of them are overpriced and worthless except for one : Wet PlatinumWet Platinum Premium Lubricate , 8.9-Ounce Bottle.My partner and I decided to try the latest in `` water-based '' lubes and went with the most highly rated ( including this one ) . They are horrible and essentially useless as they become sticky within minutes . The only explanation I can think of is that anyone giving them a high rating must not have tried silicone-based lubes .	-1
I/we love Liquid Silk , so I was excited to try this product that they produce . Well ... one trial was enough for both of us . We used it for vaginal sex , and my girl had a burning sensation from it pretty quickly , and that lasted for over a day . I experienced some burn , and some itch for a day . If anyone wants a full bottle of this stuff , I 'd be happy to send it ... provided you give me a liability disclaimer !	-1
This product is n't worth 18 dollars . There is nothing special that designates that this is worth 18 dollars . Save your money .	-1
I used it once and it seemed okay ... 2nd time I felt it burn ... 3rd time I could definitely tell it was because of the Maxiumus lube . I 'm very disappointed that I ca n't use this . This seems to be a very common problem with this lube ... I wish I had read the reviews a bit closer .	-1
I only purchased this because a friend suggested it . I now have a bone to pick with them..Pro : Pump bottle ? ! Heck yea~No odor ! No Dyes.Works great at first.Gel-ish . Does n't drip easilyCon : Because its first ingredient is water , it evaporates and leaves everything else behind Very quickly.Not Pretty ! Peels and pills like white glue . So not sexy..I suppose if you keep a bowl of water next to you to keep rehydrating this product ... it would work ... .	-1
1 ) this product does not come sterile wrapped..it is NOT wrapped at all2 ) it is NOT very sticky..mine would not stick at allBecause of the lack of sterile wrap..makes me wonder how they are kept and handled for mail ... ( yellow paper mail envelope ) I have 3 that I have no use for ... .would NOT purchase again .	-1
This is not much of a protector for elbows because the padding is so thin . Do n't see how it could begin to protect feet . I will have to keep trying to find the perfect version .	-1
Bought these Heelbo pads in size large for my husband for is about 6 ' 180 lbs . It was purchased for his elbow . These pads are so tight they actually cut off the circulation to his forearm and cause swelling . It 's a pity these pads did n't fit because they seem durably constructed and look like they would survive repeated wearings and washings . But they just are too small . I	-1
The heelbo seemed to be the answer to my need for elbow pads , but the large size was FAR too tight and the material was irritating . I tried to stretch them out , as they are supposed to fit up to a 19 inch limb . I could hardly get them over a 16 inch can and they are still not comfortable . I bought the elbow protector cradle lite X large and it 's the answer ! It is a bit long , but it 's soft like a sock and does n't irritate my skin . It 's large enough and white as my workplace requires . I 'll probably use the heelbos to clean my car and toss them .	-1
i noticed no difference , less a nasty taste in my mouth . it needs to work better than it does now	-1
In attempt to find a substitute for the now outrageously priced Oasis , I decided to try Thayer 's lemon and mint . First off , I find the taste to be totally gross . Also , there is n't enough glycerin in the product to provide much relief from dry mouth . I did n't save anything if it does n't work .	-1
My husband and I decided to try to have kids again . We try going to the dr first and take the pills he prescribed with no luck . So we decided to try these and nothing yet . If I do get pregnant I will edit this review .	-1
I did n't really look into the description of these vitamins before I bought them . They are pretty much the same exact thing as a regular multi vitamin . So , save your money and get multi-vitamins .	-1
I did n't like this product . We never had any `` problems '' getting pregnant the first time before we tried this but I decided to give it a go after I had a miscarriage in June 2010 . I bought the set for both female and male back in July . I only took 3 days of the female one due to being hospitlized for something else so I do n't know if it helped my fertility in anyway but my husband took the male one for about 2 wks and we noticed that his `` load '' ( sorry TMI ) was DECEASED then the way it was before he got on the medication . He said that he did n't like the way it made him feel either , and once he stopped he returned back to `` normal '' and within 4 wks of stopping we got pregnant anyways in late August . So I doubt we 'll be ordering this in the future .	-1
Such a late date less then 2 months to go.I returned them and went to the store and got one with more then 4 years remaining .	-1
I never thought I had a big head , but maybe it is ( in more than one way ? ) . My hair is pretty short , too.When the frames clicked together , they were right up against my eyeballs . My eyelashes were plastered against the glass . That was after I pulled them out so they were at the maximum size ( there 's a very small amount of adjustment ) .There 's no give in the solid plastic strap that goes around the back of the head . Interesting idea , but not something that works for me.I called the manufacturer , who simply said `` You can send them back to Amazon . '' Thanks .	-1
I can not tolerate the herbs in this formula . Otherwise , I think the joint stuff works very well , but my system responds negatively to the herbs . Had I read the product description more carefully , I would not have tried this product .	-1
I am a 40+ year old man , and go to the gym at least 3-5 times a week . I gave the & # 34 ; Ripped Man & # 34 ; product a try , as I 've used the Irwin Naturals & # 34 ; Only One & # 34 ; multivitamin . While I am serious about exercise , I 've got a few inches around my midsection that is pretty stubborn . I thought , & # 34 ; what the heck ? & # 34 ; I 'll give it a try . I received no noticeable effect from the product . The only reason I give it two stars rather than just one , is that it did n't do anything harmful , either .	-1
Did n't notice a difference one bit . Took 3 in the morning , about an hour before my first cardio session . Found out I got more of a lift from drinking green tea than I did by taking this.Tried taking all 6 at once even , still nothing.Do n't waste your time or money on this .	-1
I had heard only rave reviews about Catalyn as to it being so amazing for the immune system and for being a wonder drug . I was eager to try it since I am prone to tonsilitis infections and catch every cold that I come in contact with . I ca n't really say that this aided me in my immune protection since I could n't continue taking the pills . Anytime I would take ONE pill my stomach would cramp up and I would feel like I was going to vomit . This was even after taking meals and drinking water . This pill just does NOT agree with my stomach for some reason ! I have taken other Standard Process vitamins in the past and they have n't cramped me up like this one . I even thought I would just try taking this at night instead ( I mean if I 'm sleeping I ca n't really feel the upset stomach ! ) but was shocked to find that any night I would take this I would toss and turn and have CRAZY nightmares ! Strange ! I actually tried this nightmare theory off and on to see if I was just imagining it and I am TOTALLY sure that this has something in it that would cause some sort of odd sleep patterns . So beyong weird ! Anyways , This is n't for me . I ca n't get past the nasty cramping in the stomach to continue taking it . I am debating over whether to try Congaplex or Immunoplex instead but am nervous that they will have the same effect . I want something that will boost my immune system but not make me feel like I am going to throw up all day . Oy !	-1
This is soooo horrible tasting , that you have to have non-functioning tastebuds to get it down . I thought I 'd give it a try based on the reviews , but I could n't even get halfway through the bottle . Might have been able to get them down if they had some sort of dissolvable coating on them . Tasted bad , and due to the acid reflux , I got to retaste them multiple times . Yuck .	-1
I have several squeaky floors , some downstairs and some upstairs . I can probably fix the downstairs squeaks byfixing the problem by going under the house in the crawl space but I have no way to fix the upstairs squeaks . WhenI saw this kit , I figured that I had finally found a way to silence those irritating floor squeaks . The kit arrivedquickly by UPS and I immmediately went to work on the upstair 's squeaks . My bathroom joists were easy to find throughthe vinyl flooring using an electronic stud finder . Following the kit 's instructions for vinyl flooring , I started puttingscrews into the joists . Sadly after only putting in 6 screws , the Driver that comes in the kit and fits into your drillstripped out . After that happened , I could no longer use it to drive in the special screws that come with the kit . My drill is n't any more powerful than the next and my wooden joists are n't any harder than anyone else 's . The Driver has a square head on it to fit the square holes in the screws . That square head became rounded after driving only 6 screws . Unbelieveable.I could ask the company who makes the kit to send me another Driver , but it 'll probably just do the same thing as the first one . I really wanted to fix those squeaky floors but I ca n't do it with this kit . I 'm going to send it back to Amazon and get my money back . Guess I 'll have to live with that squeaky bathroom floor for awhile longer .	-1
Spot-X was not very effective at removing hard water and sea salt deposits from my Honda Civic windshield . Very disappointed .	-1
I hate shaving . This does n't help at all and makes the process longer and annoying and no more effective . I do n't know . It smells good and is nice but I do not see the point	-1
Its ok but definitely not worth buying because of the price.It does not do anything awesome to your face before shaving . Yes , smells good and a nice brand but not worth buying it because their may be better products available if you are ready to spend so much money.I will not buy it again .	-1
I 've shaved with and without the pre-shave oil for over a month . I notice no difference what so ever . I was hoping this would make my razor glide a bit better , and it definitely did n't help with that . I do like the after shave lotion though .	-1
If you like the smell of AOS Sandalwood , that is about the only thing going for this product . Really there is more scent coming from the other oils in the product as compared to the sandalwood essential oil . The other thing is this is an oily product that is thick and sticky . If you like to wetshave with water rinses in your sink , you can bet this will leave an oily very sticky ring on the sink after only one shave.I recommend using Proraso Pre as it is just as effective , picks the hairs up better for a shave , and rinses very cleanly . Do a pre-shave for effectiveness not scent as any scent is not going to make it through the soap lathering , rinse and resultant aftershave anyway.I 've also used non-lathering shaving creams like Kiss My Face ad Cremo Creme as pre-shave alternatives with very good results as well .	-1
I love the concept behind this powder but the taste is way to overpowering to be palatable . It tastes like it 's loaded with sweeteners and mint ( maybe to mask its true flavor ? ) . Either way , it 's like drinking tooth paste . I like to make smoothies with fruits , but the minty taste does n't mix well with most things , and ultimately my motivation to drink it lessens each day . Too bad because I FEEL great after I drink it . Ultimately I 'll stick with salads and eating whole , fresh veggies every day .	-1
I must be an anomaly because I just could not drink this . The taste of mint was nauseatingly overpowering and I typically like mint . I 'm guessing this green drink must be better in comparison for those reviewers who have had worse . However , Amazon was great about the return , so gave an extra star . To each his own .	-1
I love the taste , but it 's NOT actually gluten free . Also , going by what others say ... it has MSG in it too under the natural flavors.My chiropractor recommended this because she loves it and uses it daily , so I decided to give it a shot . Within minutes of drinking it , I was in the bathroom , completely sick . The front of the container says `` gluten free '' , but it is not ! It has barley and wheat in it . I 'm so disappointed because I love the taste and even though we eat very healthy , it 's nice to get an extra boost ! Looking for another option . : (	-1
honestly i do n't know how anyone can say a green supplement `` tastes great '' . Overall this is surely one of the best I have tried . Many i have tried i can not get past the taste at all . I mix this with my protein shakes and it tastes acceptable . The green flavor is there but not overly pronounced like some other ones I have tried . Will probably order again*UPDATE*ok so after a few days I 'm already sick of the flavor.. uhg.. got two more green products to try before i just call it quits on the green supplements*Update 2*ca n't even force myself to drink this anymore.. i have been able to stand doing half scoop mixed with protein powder ... amazing grass chocolate so far is the only green supplement i have not wanted to throw away after a week ...	-1
This squeeze ball is a child 's size . I can barely squeeze it . It is so small.Get a racket ball.Pass this one by .	-1

Nature 's Way Activated Charcoal is not marketed as a stool stabilizer for those suffering from IBS . Nor is it marketed as a treatment for gas . However , so many people have stated that it has worked wonders for IBS sufferers and have given it 5 stars , that I countered with 1 star because it definitely did not help me , even in the slightest . I do not recommend this product for treating the symptoms of IBS .	-1
This product did not work at all , I tried another brand and i saw results . I do n't recommend this product .	-1
No significant difference in taking ; taste is horrible , does not mix well , caused digestive distress and a waste of money for me .	-1
These simply did not clean our glasses . I thought something was wrong with our dishwasher but when we switched back to the cascade we were used to it solved the issues . I suspect some dishwashers simply prefer different types of detergent .	-1
Ugh ! I hate these but for some reason my husband loves them . They leave a horrible residue on dishes ( especially non-stick cookware ) which you can taste and have to rinse off after the dishes are supposed to be clean ! What 's the point in using a dishwasher if you have to re-wash the dishes to get off this nasty residue ? My husband likes them because they do get rid of stuck on food . My husband does n't see the point in rinsing dishes before putting them in the dishwasher . Which I think is silly since you have to rinse the residue off the dishes before putting them away ... We are n't buying these anymore . I prefer Cascade .	-1
I bought a box of these because they combine Jet-Dry ( which , I 'm sorry , does not work ) with a pre measured tablet of detergent . The results are horrible . Dishes are barely clean and covered in spots . Do not waste your money , go with Cascade 2-In-1 Action Pacs instead .	-1
got these through the subscribe and save after the finish gel packs were no longer offered.big disappointment . left residue on dishes and glasses where previously there was none.I will find a better product and/or be forced to go the a grocery store instead of Amazon.too bad .	-1
I 've used Finish before , but this one , in packets , left granules and powered residue on glassware , anything horizontal . I had ordered it as a recurrinjg order and quickly cancelled it to return to the product I have been using , instead , .I would n't use this again if it was no-cost .	-1
I WOULD SUGGEST YOU USE A SMALL AREA TO TRY THIS OUT . I PUT IT ON MY SHOULDER AND BROKE OUT IN A RASH AND ITCHING ALL OVER MY BODY . HORRIBLE HORRIBLE TOOK A COUPLE OF HOURS TO WORK ITS WAY OUT OF MY SYSTEM . I TOOK 3 SHOWERS.NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE .	-1
Pretty much the same as the pills - good relief at first ans then it levelled off . Maybe this I 'd for short term pain use and I missed that in the description .	-1
I did try this for muscle pain and also for arthritis relief but had no reaction or relief . In addition I found that the product is fragrance free but I found it a bit greasy .	-1
Very disappointed with this especially for the price . In my experience it does absolutely nothing to alleviate pain and I do n't believe that it has any special ingredients that would enable it to do so .	-1
I tried to love this product . But like the pills from the same company , it did nothing for me . Perhaps it works on a different kind of issue than mine ... .sadly , nada for me .	-1
I did not find these helpful . They still slipped and looked really dirty really quickly . There are better ones out there , I will go back to the old gray brand I used before .	-1
If you need a temporary `` tread '' for your shoes , this is the product for you . If you wanted something permanent , this might not be it . It lasted 3 days for me , and did a great job for those 3 days . Then it started peeling off and then I had to throw it away .	-1
Grip is good but did not last on the underside of my brand new shoe for more than a day .	-1
I have not had any success with sole stoppers . They always come off as soon as I walk in them . I 've even tried super glue and these still came off my shoe as well .	-1
Purchased this pad for $ 69 from amazon on December 18 2010 and we use it often . However today , ( 17 months later ) its totally burned out . Maybe that 's a good amount of time but for almost $ 70 I would expect more longevity .	-1
If you 're looking for a low/medium heating pad that you can fall asleep on without fear of burning , this is the pad for you . If you 're looking for fast-acting , therapeutic HIGH heat , buy a Thermophore instead . I have both heating pads and prefer the Thermophore by far . The drawback to the the Thermophore is that it has only one setting : on or off . You need to hold onto a small switch to keep the heating pad turned on . The benefit of this system is that you directly control the heat . When you press the button , the Thermophore quickly turns hot . When it feels too hot , you let go of the button and it begins to cool down . In a few minutes , you press the button and get a second burst of high heat . This is called infusion heat therapy and is said to be the most therapeutic kind of heat . In my experience , this is definitely true . I bought the Theratherm because I thought it would be simpler . It advertises the same maximum heat as the Thermaphore with the convenience of digital control ( simply set it to the temperature you want , and then set the timer for up to 60 minutes . ) The problem is that the thermostat is n't accurate . It reaches peak heat very quickly and automatically turns itself off , never feeling hot for more than a minute . ( Instead , it emits a low-level heat for up to one hour ) . So , consider your goals and make your choice accordingly . For me , I choose the Thermaphore ( which is also sold on Amazon.com ) .	-1
Make no mistake , this is a great pad . In the past four years I have purchased three of these . As much as I like the pad , this time I purchased a Thermophore Arthritis pad because this last one only lasted 8 months before it began to fail . Apparently there must be a design flaw in that after using the pad for awhile , it seems to develop a short where the cord is fastened inside to the pad . I do use my pad every day so this gets a good workout but nevertheless , I feel that something that costs this much should last longer . The one prior to this one lasted exactly 14 months which was just after the warranty expired . This one is still under warranty but it is going to be expensive to ship back and forth for replacement and I am just not sure if the hassle is worth it.When this is new , it is great because you can set the time/temperature for up to an hour . I fall asleep most nights with it on my lower back which is my problem area . The relief is incredible and like their advertisement says , no drug store pad or cheap heating pad is even in the same league with this one . The moist heat it produces provides immediate and lasting relief . However , they do need to correct this design flaw since the last two have failed the same way . When it begins to fail , the digital display on the control will flash on and off . It will then work for a few days and do it again . In a very short time it gets to the point that you have to push and pull the cord and actually fold the pad over to press down on the inside wiring to get it to heat up . If this had not happened so quickly to the last two of mine , I would think it was just an anomoly . But this last one failed even more quickly than the one before so I am convinced it is a design flaw . **********Since writing this review , I decided to take my faulty pad apart and see if I could fix the problem . This involved removing the inner stitching across the bottom of the pad where the cord feeds out . Sure enough , there was a twisted wire way up inside which I straightened out and the pad is again working . Because I do n't have much confidence in how long it will work , I simply fastened the bottom back up with 4 safety pins so that I can access the inside wires again if need be . Just make sure you unplug it before you start working on it ! *******	-1
I appreciate that we are each wired differently so what works for one may not for another without the product being a `` defect '' , or a product can be defective . I have not noticed any good effect and it has foul fishy smell & taste . I tried it on my face but could n't stand the smell !	-1
After being told it had shipped 2 times them being told it did not , then being told it did ship but was lost , then saying they were out of stock and could not get more ... hmmm well there you go ...	-1
I tried one . I could barely get through it they taste so nasty . After the torcher of trying it . I felt no relief or results .	-1
This water bottle certainly does not hold 2 litres water , it holds at most 1.2 litres ( and for that you have to fill it to the brim ) . The quality is good , but what am I supposed to do with a child-size bottle ? I had to get a refund on this one.And oh , I didnt receive the ribbed one . Not happy ! !	-1
Wonderful idea and really needed due to surgery however very frustrating that I 've never been able to open the package ! ! ! What 's the point of selling something no one can use ? ?	-1
Way too small for what I needed them for .	-1
I was looking into a natural alternative to benzodiazepines and decided to try passionflower after reading the positive reviews . I do not find that it helps alleviate anxiety very much . Perhaps if you have very mild anxiety , it will help you - slight worry , even a mild insomnia . For me , anxiety is a pervasive personality trait and interferes with most daily activities . This product , at its maximum dosage , made me feel slightly sleepy , like I 'd taken a Benadryl . Not much else.The taste was n't horrible - kind of grassy , like others said , but mixed with a few ounces of water and swallowed quickly , it was definitely tolerable . Nowhere near as bad as cough syrup .	-1
too big and unflexible , ok to insert , but does n't really bend and hurts to get out , feels uncomfortable too , when you 're sitting , ... great idea but wish they had different sizes , this one ai n't cutting it , ..	-1
This shaving brush holder was broke when it arrived . I can tell it is cheaply made and even with better packaging it probably would n't take much to break it . Do not buy . Go with the stainless steel , marble or other metal ones .	-1
Has a nice old school look to it , but would be better without the hole and sticky tape on the back ( which I removed , since I wanted it to be free standing ) . I had to grind out the opening where the brush is held to allow it to go in properly . Dremel tool to the rescue . After that it does what it supposed to . Did n't bother me since the price was reasonable , but the quality reflects the price .	-1
Looks really nice but its really cheap plastic , and it broke within a couple weeks of my husband using it . Cheap junk .	-1
this is just too short and the hole is too small to fit the tweezerman brush i bought to go along with it : (	-1
Bought brand new . It DID NOT WORK from DAy 1 . The LED lights flicker red for a split second and then go off and nothing happens after many hours . Very disaapointing . Do n't waste your money . Design is poor , b/c if it flips out , that only adds to risk of loose connections from plug side to recharging side .	-1
I bought this for a hot toddy recipe that I never ended up making . They 're sort of a homespun Luden 's cough drop , but more candy-like . Odd medicine-y taste , yet sweet . Sucked on a few for a couple of days while doing work . Ended up throwing out more than half the bag ; considered them mildly sweet candies that were not worth the calories .	-1
A lot of money for distilled water . You ca n't even use this on a cut , you 'd have to use the whole bottle what a waste money !	-1
I end up tugging on my hangnails because the clipper is not sharp enough . Just use bathroom scissors if you can keep yours sharp .	-1
This arrived unexpected , I did not order it but Amazon was very helpful in getting my order straightened out . I am going to rate it anyway since it WAS in my care for a short time . It seemed to me to be expensive for what it was but I am not an expert and did not need the product .	-1
These are advertised as Gluten Free , but they are n't . Do not buy this product if you have Celiac Disease .	-1
I marked this down to two stars because I just found out from the company that one cap has 1billion CFU . Thus it would take 15 of these to equal 3 ( one serving ) caps of the Ultra ( 1 cap=5billion CFU ) . I see that the Ultra is now $ 49 . for 180 vs. Primal for $ 41 . Very disappointed . I will go back to Ultra next time	-1
Originally I purchased their Primal Defense Ultra , which worked ok and helped clear up my Wife 's yeast issue . Sadly by mistake when I re-ordered I got this . Thinking this was sent in error I returned the product for an exchange , turns out they are essentially selling us JUNK as this is supposed to be LIVING bacteria , not some filler in a tablet form ! ! ! I even contacted the company about it , they insisted that it was a & # 34 ; Caplet & # 34 ; not a & # 34 ; tablet & # 34 ; As it is , using it for 2 months it had no benefit and my wife 's yeast issue returned ! ! ! ! In the future i will be avoiding all of their products .	-1
This is my personal response to Primal Defense and I understand that everyone is different : I have taken Garden of Life 's Primal Defense in powder and capsule form , taken 3 times daily as the bottle states , and it made my bloating much worse . Of all of the probiotics I 've tried , Primal Defense was the only one that actually caused harm.The taste is that of rancid hemp powder ( gritty , earthy , dry ) I have heard that sometimes your gastro symptoms worsen when you start a probiotic because it 's your body flushing out the bad bacteria . I have not found any scholarly articles that back this up and until proven otherwise I must disagree with this hypothesis.I 've used Ultimate Flora , Jarrow , Garden of Life raw probiotics , PB 8 , and others , and the only success I 've had is with Thorne Floramend.I have been struggling with bloating and malabsorption for over 2 years ( due to auto-immune illness lupus , and candida ) . I could eat 1 cucumber slice and bloat up like a pregnant woman.After 1 month of taking Thorne Floramend daily ( always with food , as the bottle states ) I have been able to eat 3 small meals a day ! There was no `` bad bacteria die off reaction '' , only steady progress towards a healthy gut.I 've done 5 , 10 , 50 , 80 , 100 , and 200 billion organism preparations of Ultimate Flora , Jarrow , Garden of Life raw probiotics , PB 8 , and others , and have come to understand that the amount of organisms is not what 's important , it 's the ability for the capsule to pass into the small intestine without being destroyed by your stomach acid.Thorne uses acid resistant capsules ( surprisingly most other probiotics do not ) . This attribute alone makes it well worth the cost ( $ 39 for 30 caps ) .I am happy to say I have gained 5 lb 's this last month ( I am very underweight ) and am excited to continue to heal .	-1
Tastes good but after many months , I 'm still not pregnant . I 'm sure the women who got pregnant with it probably would have with it too . It was just coinscidence after drinking the tea . We ultimately have no control over our fertility , God does .	-1
I had bad results when I tried chasteberry supplements , so I knew I was taking a gamble when I tried this tea . Chasteberry at even the small dose of 250mg made me feel groggy and confused . It was like being in a haze for hours . I keep hearing raves about chasteberry for PCOS , and thought in a tea , it may be easier to take in . Wrong . I got the same effects , and worse , I was very irritated/moody as this was wearing off . It is not unusual for me to get PMS moodswings , but not at this time of the month . I 've been doing a good job of regulating my periods lately , and should not have attempted a change . I 'm a slim woman and sensitive to medicines , but I really do n't know how a woman of any size and tolerance level could NOT feel the STRONG effects of this . There really needs to be a disclaimer with this product that chasteberry can cause these side effects.I have PCOS and guess I 'm this desperate to get my cycles regulated and feel like a real woman again . But , this experience has taught me to be much more careful . What 's really bad is when I had Amazon request a return label from this company ( which is the return process ) , I got an automatic response saying , basically , do n't bother if the product has already been opened . I sent a reply similar to the review I posted here , and await response from the company ... .I wanted to add that I had to buy a new tea ball for this tea as some of the particles are tiny and seeped through the holes . Even my new mesh tea ball did n't do much better . I wish I had one positive thing to say about this tea . The flavor was alright . That 's the one and only positive . I do n't want a baby , but if I had to go through stuff like this to get one , I 'd give up !	-1
I do n't even know what I did with this . Ca n't say if it works or not because I never really used it because it 's loose leaves and I did n't have the time to brew it etc . if these were tea bags I would have given it a try . So I ca n't say it works or does n't work because I did n't use it at all .	-1
Item arrived very promptly . However , I was disappointed about the expiration date of the product . Received item that is due to expire July 2014 . Only good thin is that I need it for the beginning of June . Otherwise It would have been a bust .	-1
I bought this heating pad but will be returning it due to lack of satisfaction . I hate the switch that you HAVE to continually press down for the pad to continue to produce heat ( when you let go it will stop producing more heat ) . If you feel you want a pad that will automatically produce heat without you having to manually control everything , look for another brand !	-1
I bought my thermophore eight months ago . I always took care of it , and thought of it as a valuable investment -- in terms of money , but also because it is very useful in my medical care.It worked very well ... at first . Then it started to warm less and less . Till one day , it warmed no more.I did not worry . The manual stated that the manufacturer stood behind their products and that they had a shop in US soil full of workers willing to fix their products for free if under warranty , or repair them for $ 30 if past warranty.My thermophore was well within its warranty period . I sent it well packed with a copy of my original receipt.I was then , in shock , when I received a form letter that informed that my warranty did not apply because my thermophore had been manufactured over three years ago . Yet at least as far as a consumer can tell , the date of manufacture is not written anywhere in the original box , its manual , or the device itself . And , if the device spent over three years in an Amazon warehouse , is that reason to declare a product ineligible for warranty coverage ? Why was this requirement never documented anywhere in the manual , in the warranty text , or the website of the manufacturer ? And what about that $ 30 offer to fix the thermophore ? I was instead , offered to be charged $ 40 instead.Needless to say a disappointment ! This company and its product might have at some point manufactured excellent products , but seems that the pernicious temptation to destroy customer loyalty by saving a few bucks has seeped in ... This is a manufacturer in decline . Look elsewhere for a good heating pad .	-1
It does work well , but I do not like the control on it . You have to press the control knob on and continually hold it until it gets too hot then release it . I would have preferred a turn on and turn off control like a regular heating pad where you can turn it to Low , Med , or hot . I do not like the control feature on this at all . I get tired of continually havong to press and hold the control .	-1
Gave me weird dreams . Would not recommend . I prefer Valerian root instead . It gives me a more restful sleep . Chamomile , not so much .	-1
I have social anxiety . This stuff does nothing for me . The only stuff that seems to truly work so far is Phenibut XT .	-1
True Calm Amino Relaxer : I tried this a few times and it did n't do anything for me . Maybe I did n't try it enough or maybe I did n't use enough capsules , not sure . The capsules were very easy to swallow .	-1
I lost my sex drive when I began taking the supplement . At the same time , I noticed no reduction in stress . Try it if you want , but pay attention to the side effects .	-1
tried a whole bottle . not near as good as other similar products . it was shipped fast and in good shape . i have used other now products that i liked .	-1
i was hoping this could replace the xanex i have been taking for 2 years.. i took one and felt nothing , took 2 , felt nothing , took 3 , started feeling dizzy and nauseous . i was really disappointed . if you have pretty bad social anxiety or generalized anxiety like i do ( have racing thoughts as soon as you wake up and frequent full blown panic attacks ) i doubt this would work for you.. but then again , my anxiety is higher then most .	-1
I ordered this supplement to pack with other medicinals for a trip to South Africa -- at the last minute . Thanks to Amazon Prime I had it in 2 days . Right on Amazon Prime ! ! Only problem -- totally not usable owing to the animal gelatin capsules.I ca n't understand why an organic , herbal supplement would be encased in anything other than a vegetable capsule . In fact , I 've learned something . All this time I 've been thinking `` organic '' ruled out the use of such things as pork gelatin -- apparently I was wrong.Will give an update after following up with Nature 's Way.UPDATE : The Nature 's Way people were very prompt in refunding my money . I was able to buy another version minus the animal based capsule .	-1
Not a great trimmer . I bought this to replace an old one of a different brand and thought it work in a similar fashion however it does n't seem to move as efficiently and the power seems to be lower . I did n't like it and bought a new one .	-1
My rechargeable shaving kit finally went kaput , and I bought a new beard trimmer . Unfortunately the one I bought does n't have the option to change into a nose hair trimmer , so I bought one of these for a fair price.Almost immediately I noticed that the tip was slightly out of shape . Even making sure the plastic clip was locked in place , I found that the tip would come apart easily . The motor seems to run at inconsistent speeds , even with a brand new battery . Both of these defects made it very difficult , if not impossible to use the device properly.It is a good item in theory , but poor construction and low quality materials hinder its function . Spend a few more dollars and buy a better model . I had thePhilips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming Systemand used the nose hair trimmer attachment and it worked great . And the price is not too bad . I 'm going back to the better model .	-1
I got it because unlike other personal mini trimmers this one seemed to get very good reviews . I must of got a sadistic version . I started using it and it ripped out a nose hair . I thought OK I must have trimmed too fast and the blades could n't keep up so I slowed my pace a little and it did it again . I think there must be a gap inbetween the blades and the shaver also bogs down which can cause it . I started using my old one again.I finally found one that is perfect . I was in Best Buy which I normally avoid but they have this Remington personal trimmer model NE3560 in there that sort of looks like the Norelco Trimmer but with a more stout handle . It has a small angled head like the Norelco but with twin cutting blades and uses a AA battery instead of the normal AAA so it powerful , never bogs down . It is on the Best Buy web site . this is the best one I 've used .	-1
Worked at first but not after some months it has a hard time to turn on . You have to take it a part after using and make sure everything is cleaned and then put it back together and even then had a hard time starting . Would have to take it a part and start it without the blade in and then put it back together and hope it would start .	-1
Spend $ 3 more and get the Remington PG-165 ... you 'll be glad you did . Every time I use this trimmer it falls apart into 3 pieces and I have to put it back together again . The blade / motor is weak and struggles to do a good job . This thing is very cheap and it 's a case of you get what you pay for ... .hope this helps you avoid my mistake !	-1
This deodorant is n't as good as I thought it would be . I does smell good but it clumps together and it was definately way too expensive for it 's quality .	-1
I replaced my Violight half a dozen times over the past few years . It was hard to fit one of my toothbrushes in the hole , and I was always cleaning the unit . Sometimes I 'd get a burned smell from my toothbrush , and when I opened the Violight there would be black charring on the plastic inside . I also noticed that , despite us shaking off our toothbrushes religiously , water was pooling ( and smelled foul ) in the bottom of the unit . One reviewer mentioned she was getting sick from having her toothbrush upside down in water , and I believe her.I looked around and settled on the Multiple Toothbrush & Razor UV Sanitizer Wall Mounted , here at Amazon . It wall mounts with either sticky tape or screws ( they give you both ) , has a sidecar for toothpaste ( we did n't attach ours ) , the toothbrushes easily hang head up so they stay dry , there 's room for a razor ( I do n't use that , either ) , and the whole thing looks nice ( just a rectangular blue on the wall ) . I wish I 'd know about this product before I ever paid more money and bought my first Violight .	-1
Wow , what a waste . Not only are the other negative reviews correct , the poor design on this product had me immersing my toothbrush head into a pool of collected water at the bottom of this `` sanitizer '' . This seems to be a well put together product because of its sleek and cool looking design . However , as the saying goes , `` appearances can be decieving '' . Aside from this , the disinfective qualities of this product are probably just as effective as letting a toothbrush naturally air dry .	-1
Who would actually think such a gizmo is even useful if it DID do what it claims ? ( 1 ) Anything that gets on your toothbrush head was ALREADY in your mouth . Unless you think your houseguests are cleaning their shoe soles with your toothbrush while you are n't looking . ( 2 ) You are sitting a wet toothbrush head upside down in this gizmo . Which means it is sitting in a puddle of water that is likely to mold/mildew . So you can put mold/mildew INTO your mouth ( that was NOT in your mouth before ) . ( 3 ) The puddle of water is likely to ( a ) rust out the innards of this gizmo and ( b ) short-circuit the gizmo 's electronics . ( 4 ) The American Dental Association says these gizmos have no proven beneficial health benefits : [ ... ] Given all that , it seems your money would be better spent betting `` Hard 8 '' at the Craps table in Vegas .	-1
Purchased for my wife , she found it uncomfortable and the pressure was too much on her sensitive muscle areas and trigger points . Amazon and the seller were excellent for the return . May be helpful for some .	-1
this thing looks like a weapon more than something that will help you . i bought this on another site because i think i had a better price there . this thing is sturdy , it should last a long time . it comes with really no usable instructions , and any videos online did n't help either . this device is in a word - awkward . it 's hard to use , hard to reach points on your body . if you are a bit overweight , that knob in the middle will stab your mid section . used on the back it 's hard to find the spot that hurts , because the ends hurt no matter how you use them . the ball end does n't feel like much and the pointy end feels like too much.I 've tried using this on other parts of my body with no luck at all , and when i was really in pain , this thing did n't help me at all . what works far better is a lacrosse ball , in minutes it works better.then there is storage , you ca n't store this thing . it does n't stand . it looks like a sex toy so putting it out in the open makes it stand out . it falls over , it hurts you when it does . it 's just very hard to store .	-1
Based on the great reviews , I bought this thinking that it would really help release my trigger points and the tension in my shoulders , but I was wrong . It actually makes me more sore every time I use it ( and I do not shy away from pain - I gave the Rumble Roller a rave review and that thing is intense , but totally effective ) . I would n't not recommend this .	-1
I bought this weird shape stick after having read all apprasing reviews . Are all these people real ? I do not know what to do with this stick , really . I am thinking of returning it but I am aftraid I will pay too much for the shipping so it will not worth it . I agree with one who wrote that some people are making very good money on this ... .. I regret that I bought it .	-1
I have a lot of muscle knots in my back , and this has done very little to alleviate them . I was originally going to rate this 3/5 because I seem to be a one off , but frankly its not doing what it claims to do .	-1
I bought two Good Grips button hooks . The wire portion of the button hooks appears to be cheap , paperclip quality metal that is poorly anchored in the handle . After a couple of years of light use , the wire broke on one hook and became loose in the handle of the other .	-1
I watched Dr. Oz and the product seemed to be a natural way to increase my metabolism and help me lose my 10 pounds . However , after taking it for a while one hour before exercising , as the guest on Dr. Oz suggested , my thyroid level went down for the first time in my life . I told this to my doctor who recommended I stop taking it . I stopped taking it and had my thyroid level drawn again in a few weeks and it went back to normal . I just recommend that you make sure and check your thyroid levels when taking any pills that increase your metabolism .	-1
My old Norelco rotary stopped working so I thought I will replace that with a similar priced shaver like a Panasonic or Braun shaver and bought this one a while ago . What a disappointment ! While it is ok ( and comfortable ) for regular shaving on the face ( daily shaving - if you let it grow a little more then it is a little more painful since Braun seems to pluck the hair out.. ) , shaving in the neck area is a lot worse than Norelco . Even after several minutes of trying I could n't get all the hair in neck area cleaned out . Norelco also takes a couple of tries , but this one did n't work even after 10 tries.I tried wet shaving next to see if that helps . That also did n't help . So I returned it back to Amazon.Pros : price , construction quality , handlingCons : sound , not able to handle neck hair .	-1
I have owned many electric razors and of late I have been purchasing Bruan 's . I seem to go thru an electric razor every 3 years or so . My last 3 razors have been Braun 's thus this is my forth . I bought it because of the many postive reviews and because I was totally satisfied with my previous Braun razors . Not any more . This razor just does not shave . It a very solid built razor , thus out of the package I was pleased . But after the first shave I was not happy . I have been using it for 4 months now , I even changed the foil and blades as I bought extras when I made my original purchase . Still a very poor shave . I have been using my blade razor most of the time and only use the Bruan for a quick touch up . I am now reviewing which razor to go to next . I may buy a high end Braun but I hate to spend that kind of money and end up with the same results . I would not recommend this razor to anyone .	-1
I 'll try anything once . I dont really know what i was expecting , but i received nothing.It did not give me any more energy than i already had .	-1
Do not purchase it for fibroid didnt shrink fibroid nor help wirh symptoms.Sorry but i am unhappy with this product .	-1
The bottle I bought fro Amazon has no expiration date and no production date.I have an old order that I got a year ago that has not expired yet and when I got new bottle the capsules have different color and they smell differently.I opened both caps and tasted and they were slightly different in taste.I called CHI 's Enterprise and they told me that they are not going to stamp the date on the bottle unless they are asked from the seller to do so . On my question why the color and the smell of 2 bottles are different they had no idea.Ordering from them directly is expensive . They charge $ 9 even though they are 2 hour away from my location.I have no idea if I should use the new bottle since CHI 's Enterprise is incompetent to explain why the product is different . I 'm afraid that they also have no control what comes from China . They just packaging the product in Anaheim , CA.Very sad , I really wanted to trust that they are a good company .	-1
I would not recommend this to anyone.This thing is heavy , it feels poorly built , the hanging loop was installed wrong and I had to fix it . The included # 1 clipper blade that comes with this seems much shorter than other # 1 blades I have used in the past .	-1
Neither my wife or I cared for this this very much . It became sticky very quickly and provided very poor lubrication . We have since tried a water based lubricant which is great .	-1
it leaves a residue that 's difficult to get off and it does n't lubricate very well . It 's too thick and sticky .	-1
they 'll only want more ! These razors are ghastly . I 've been shaving my legs for decades , I 'm always very careful , but no matter what I did , these things left a trail of nicks and cuts across my calves and thighs . These razors feel rough against the skin , it 's like shaving with a handsaw coated in sandpaper . Honestly , they are the worst razors I have ever used . Like the other women who have reviewed these skin wreckers , I 'm going back to Gillette 's Venus razors . Stay away , stay away , you 'll only end up using a whole box of band-aids to cover the gashes in your legs .	-1
They will get rid of the hair , but that 's about the only good thing they will do . They obviously tried to make the product have an appealing design , but they are cheap and become dull very quickly . They made my hair follicles actually bleed .	-1
BIC used to be top of the line in razor blade companies . I remember in the day when they were the only company on store shelves . Well those days surely have passed ! These razors cost me 10 dollars because I actually thought they 'd last a few weeks . I could only shave 3 times and they were so dull by the 3rd attempt , it literally took me 15 minutes to shave.No kidding , these blue-handle razor blades I buy at the Dollar Store typically last me 4-6 months before they get dull . Something is seriously wrong if a no-name company can outperform a popular company like BIC . I highly recommend never picking up a BIC razor unless I 'm the only unfortunate consumer who continues buying the lousy varieties , but I have a strong feeling based on the numerous people reviewing and complaining about this product here on amazon that 's not the case at all , and BIC is simply no longer at the spectacular level of good clean shaving they used to be . What a shame .	-1
I bought these at a store after reading the multiple good reviews on Amazon . I usually use disposable double blade razors . I have found that these do not perform as well as the double blade razors I usually use . The main problem is that these do not seem to cut as close to the skin . It still looks like I have a day of growth after shaving . It also takes a lot more passes with the razor to remove the hair , which actually irritates my skin more than a two blade razor . Lastly , the blade does not last as many shaves as my normal disposable razor . I have an average amount of facial hair and the blade lasts 2-3 shaves before it feels like it is just scraping my skin . This razor might work for you as it did with some of the other reviewers , but in my experience , I 'd go with another product .	-1
If you like the sight of blood or want to look like the victum of a knife attack these razors may be for you.I 've used Gillette Sensor Excel to shave my face for years but am put off by the high cost of the razors ( about a $ 1 each ) . Since my face , specifically neck , is so sensitive I go thru one of those every few days.Trying to save a little money I purchased these 144 disposable razors figuring I could throw them away after a single use and still come out way ahead . Each time I shave now I have to plan on not leaving the house for an hour or two until all the bleeding stops . Great buy if you need to get rid of some extra blood !	-1
Got these at a CVS store while traveling , after discovering I forgot to pack my regular shaver in . And what a disaster these are ! No shaving action whatsoever . After some struggle , I tried pressing it harder against my skin , got a cut and a skin irritation afterward , but it shaved nothing . Nothing at all . Period . And no , I 'm not a teenager having no experience in shaving myself . After having shaved my face for about half a century with all kinds of shavers , I can honestly state that these ones are absolutely the very worst I 've ever seen and used .	-1
Got nothing against Bic , stick to making pens and lighters ! ! ! I bought these at CVS on sale , even at the cut rate price , these dont work that great for me , I do have a heaveier beard than most , but the Gillette Fusion always gives a great shave , even thick ones like mine , that 's my favorite razor ! ! ! Like I said these Bic Comfort 3 Advance razors hurt even on the first shave , Ouch ! ! ! , sorry , dont wan na bleed , thank you ! ! ! I 'm gon na stick to my tried and true Gillette Fusion or possibly Schick Quatro ! ! ! Not recommended ! ! !	-1
This is a complete piece of junk . Avoid at all costs.Aesthetics : 3 stars . For a disposable , it actually looks pretty decent . Recently , however , there have been new disposable razors which are just as aesthetically pleasing . The Gillette Sensor3 disposables , as well as the new Schick Quattro disposables , both come to mind . It 's definitely the best-looking Bic ever made.The shave : 1 star . Ouch . Incredibly painful . I bought these just to give Bic a chance , and see if they make razors as good as some of their pens . The conclusion : they should stick to pens . Not only was it not close ( considering it 's got 3 blades ) , but it cut my face to absolute shreds . Never before have I had this kind of negative result with a razor of any kind . Sure , I get the occasional nick with just about any razor , but this was so bad I was almost embarrassed to go out in public in the hours after my shave . The shave is comparable in closeness to a Gillette Good News ! disposable.Durability : 1 star . I ca n't see this thing lasting beyond one , maybe two , shaves at the most . If you take the dive and try these things , you better do some serious face preparation -- I 'm talking hot shower , great shave cream , maybe a couple days worth of facial hair so that it 's softened up some more ... just be prepared.Concluding ... buy this razor at your own risk . You can get much better deals , and much closer shaves , with other 2-blade disposables from Gillette and Schick . My personal recommendation is the Gillette Good News ! disposable .	-1
the hold around the zipper is pathetic . I was trying to put this onto my sons bed , and it ripped at the slightest amount of tension . Luckily the tear was at the end of the bed , so no worries there.I do n't think this is a good purchase . It needs to be better constructed . I 've worn ponchos that were tougher than this is .	-1
Having lots of experience with mattress protectors , we were being gentle when we put this one on the mattress . Nevertheless , the zipper separated from the plastic on both ends .	-1
I bought these online thinking they were going to be different than the ones I buy around where I live for $ 5.00 . Boy was I wrong..I can buy these for $ 5.00 ( the same exact product ) in a store around where I live . This breaks easily..if you have kids and they jump on the bed , forget about it , they will rip . I bought two of these thinking they were going to be different than the ones they sell around my way.When me and my husband were putting this on our mattress ( I realized I had been ripped off , but did n't want to endure the hassle of sending it back to the seller ) - it ripped . The zipper broke ( mind you we were being extra careful ) and there 's a hole on the other side of it . Do n't waste your money on this..it 's not worth it ! I do n't know if the rest of these reviews are fake or unaware that you can get this product 10x cheaper elsewhere ! Horrible quality .	-1
Very light-weight . Ripped in two places as I was trying to place it on a 9 '' tall box spring . Actually placing it into the bed-frame caused a couple more rips . Used packing tape to seal the tears and offer some protection from the new bed-bug menace that seems to be sweeping the country . I will not buy this again .	-1
This is a tight fit over a twin mattress of average size , and the zipper ripped immediately . Very cheap construction . Not recommended .	-1
I did not like this urinal . It was too large for my husband to use from his bed or chair .	-1
It is very light weight and does not get hot enough . I feel like it moves around too easily since it is so light . I always feel like it does n't warm up very quickly when I put it on my soccer injuries . I use it for muscle pain and joint pain . I would not recommend this product . Get a heavier and hotter heating pad if you play sports and need a heating pad .	-1
The item I rec 'd has a 3-heat settings ( low , med , high , plus off ) `` control '' . Unfortunately the control does nothing except turn the pad on and off . The heat ( measured with meter ) is the same at all 3 heat settings : 48watts .	-1
very hard to lay on - it sits up about 2 inches , heating pad doesnt heat up well , wouldnt recommend this product to anyone . I have a chronic disease and am very disappointed in this item . Had to reorder just a regular heating pad	-1
This pad does not heat up as much as other pads I 've used . However it does vibrate at a medium and low setting .	-1
This Sunbeam 730-811 heating pad plus massage is a good idea in theory but it is really too small . The internal workings all ended up in a big ball all rolled up when you use it and it heats up for awhile . It also does n't have enough cushioning covering the vibrating mechanism , and it feels like sitting against something obtrusive all the time . I have back problems so I thought this would help ... well , it maybe lasted four months and I see amazon has a one month return policy so I have to see if I can get my money back from the manufacturer . I paid over $ 25.00 for this and it better last more than four months ! The pad had a hot smell and it turned off with both lights on ... . it shorted out and a good thing it did n't start on fire . It sure smelled hot . I 'll try to return it and tell you if I got my money back .	-1
Does n't get hot enough for me . I want enough heat to penetrate into the tight muscles , but this one wo n't do it . The hottest setting is just warm to me . My wife likes it though . Maybe it 's good for skinny people . The 9 ft. long cord is nice .	-1
Not my favorite heating pad by far . The internal wires are bulky and you can feel them too easily . The outside cover material is ok , but I have found much better . The current price posted today of $ 59.99 is ridiculous for this pad . Turning on the continuous on feature is not at all intuitive . The included instructions were vague . It does get VERY HOT , I 'll give it that . It rolls up for storage easily and has two elastic loops that keep it rolled up if you like . All in all , not a great buy . The Sunbeam Extra Large 2013-912 is FAR superior . Just the plush exterior alone makes it a better choice , as well as the very large size and soft feel while using , and at half the price ! Check it out .	-1
When ever I use this heating pad I find myself wondering whom I can tell that it stinks ! The cord disconnects from the pad , for safety reasons , when you lean on it , and then turns itself off , but you ca n't really tell when it is off ... until it 's cold . To turn the heating pad on again , the button function is complex and noisy ( when you have a sleeping person next to you ) ; you have to click through to see if it 's on or off ... which function number has come on ... the light does n't always come on so you have to turn on the lamp ... when you finally completely wake up and click through the functions , unplug it from the pad , unplug it from the wall , and get it on again ... you lean back onto it ... and it goes off again . I do not recommend this heating pad.The only positive point is that the low is very low ; most heating pads I find the low to be too hot.Since writing the above review , my mother called me to tell me that the heating pad wire , where it connects to the heating pad , cracked and both of the copper wires were exposed and that I should check mine since we got them at the same time ... I checked mine and I noticed the same thing ; where the wire joins to the pad both copper wires were exposed and it was quite a fire hazard so I am going to find a way to report this problem since it is dangerous and it happened to me an my mom in the exact same part of the wire ; it must be a weak link . Thanks to Amazon I just filled out a form to let a government agency know about the problem.Since I had this cracked wire problem , I asked my friend to check theirs and they had the same problem ; I have collected all three and hope to find a government agency who is interested because I feel this is a very dangerous device . But since I have written this review so many people have bought them ! The following brand is far superior and really works great and much higher quality ! Battlecreek # 358 Deluxe Bed Warmer with Dual Temperature Switch	-1
The stuff is okay ... it is basically Desitin with Calamine lotion . Therein lies the problem . If you get this on your clothes , as they say in Jersey , `` Fuggedabout it , '' because it is n't coming out . The company says Clorox 2 will help get it out but it simply does n't work.While the stuff is cheap it is n't worth sacrificing clothes over -- that is expensive !	-1
I hate the taste of this . It is disgusting . I almost threw up on my second sip . It has that awful protein smell and after taste .	-1
I really wanted to like this , but it was just chalky and gross . I bought it for myself , but I 'm making my husband finish it . He says it 's & # 34 ; ok & # 34 ; , but he owuld n't want to order it again either ,	-1
It 's not undrinkable , but it has a very harsh , medicinal taste . And to paraphrase Cabin Pressure , if it was ever even shown a picture of a lemon it was n't looking . Your tastebuds do adjust eventually , so if you really ca n't stand the usual milkshake model , this might be an alternative worth trying , but you should definitely find a sample pack before buying a large package .	-1
The advertising said inhaler it is a spray and is not very effective . would not purchase again not worth the money	-1
I felt like this stuff calmed me a little ... ( weird ) ... but did not get rid of any of my asthma symptoms . I wonder if , in the producer 's wisdom , they produced a calming serum since most people 's asthma is accompanied by severe anxiety since not being able to breath can be scary . It did not do what I expected but I can see how this would work for people who need a placebo effect.The directions say to spray `` under the tongue '' which was odd . If this stuff was supposed to get into the lungs in any way , this is not the way to do it ... so I assume this is NOT any kind of inhalant . It did n't come with any more directions than what is writen on the bottle so I can not be sure how this stuff is *supposed* to work . Many other people commented favorably on this product so I was pretty disappointed when I did n't get favorable results.I should have stuck with my original opinion which is Homeopathic Cures are n't medicine . When something is proven to work , it becomes Real medicine and no longer carries the `` homeopathic '' or `` alternate medicine '' tagline . I had to go back to the doctor and get the all-trusted , proven-to-work , Albuterol .	-1
I like a really close shave . Often times , I have just a couple slightly visible hair around my lips after a morning shave , and I just ca n't seem to get at it with a razor . Those times , the tweezers come out to finish the job . Question my manliness all you want , I just like a nice , clean , baby's-butt-looking face when I step out in the mornings . Unfortunately , these hardly do the job . I figured they would perform better than the slant-edge ones for the smaller and/or ingrown hairs . This is not the case , and I 'm a bit disappointed in my purchase . It has been demoted to emergency tweezers duty on hikes now . They redeemed themselves ( if barely so ) when they yanked a bee stinger from my back earlier this year . Otherwise , they just sit in my backpack , pretending to be functional .	-1
I have bought several Tweezerman tweezers and they ALL break hairs ! That is ... those hairs these tweezers actually can grip . Far too many hairs slide through them.I 'm flabbergasted . I keep reading about how wonderful they are ... well , not for me . I have about six & # 34 ; granny hairs & # 34 ; - coarse beard hair that older women sprout . I 'm NOT going around sporting six beard hairs on my chin ! I have a few thin hairs on my upper lip that are a bit dark - these tweezers break those , too . Tweezerman breaks my hairs FAR more often than the much cheaper Revlon tweezer I bought - the Revlon is slanted and has rounded corners . THAT is the best tweezer I ever used . It never breaks hairs and easily accomplishes a firm grip.http : //www.amazon.com/Revlon-Tweezer-Slanted-Tip/dp/B001B8K1L8/ref=sr_1_4 ? ie=UTF8 & qid ; =1397325896 & sr ; =8-4 & keywords ; =revlon+tweezer	-1
Got this last year and have hated it ever since . Used it initially when following a group of kids and adults in my SUV through the back woods . Tried it with the windows open as suggested , as well as with the a/c . The best I got was water that was cooler than the outside temperature , and yogurt that did not turn . I brought it indoors and plugged it in with the adapter to ac . Not much better.Some time in the Fall our fridge died and it took 2 days to replace so the insulin went into the `` cooler '' . Not a good idea and it was not even warm outside.You get what you pay for . This was cheap and may work to heat items or keep them warm . Do n't know . What I do know is that I have since bought an evaporative cooling case for my insulin in case of an emergency or when traveling .	-1
This really did n't seem to make much of a difference to me in keeping items cooler . For all the trouble and power and finding a way to situate it so it 's balanced and wo n't tip over ( without using a passenger seat ) - there just does n't seem to be any additioanl functionality or effect compared to a normal lunchbag that 's well insulated.My application : I supported retail stores on a 200 mile loop and thus bought this to work as a cooler ( or hopefully fridge ) to keep my beverages and sandwiches cool or keep them longer while I worked . ( often 12-14 hr days ) . Results were rather disapponting for me .	-1
This product does not do the job as advertised . We received it last week and took it on a short trip this weekend . Even with plugging it in in the house to cool it down , it did n't get very cold and on the trip when the car is turned off , the fridge turns off . It needs much better insulation to keep anything cold when it is turned off . Not very happy with this product at all . An ice chest works much better and is cheaper . It is n't large enough to put a dish or even leftovers in it . Only good for stacking a few drink cans or maybe some fruit .	-1
One of the lids snapped off on the third day I used this . Also , the compartments are not air/water tight . I had this sitting on my bathroom counter a few inches from the sink , and I noticed one morning that several of the compartments had water in them -- dissolving the pills that were in there . I would love to find a small monthly pill box ( much like the dispensers from birth control pills ) that just simply keep me on track to tack my 30 day supply of pills .	-1
Light did not work . Returning for refund.I like this concept and have used this type of thing before ( see my review onLED Lighted Curette Earpick Ear Wax Pick Remover Tool ) and in general , I 'd say you get what you pay for . My previous tool lasted a few months before I dropped one of the tool heads and it broke . Understandable , this is not a tool that will last forever if you are using it daily in the office as I was . It did work very well though and I was willing to replace this item a few times a year for the low price . This item is exactly the same as the one I linked to above , but is shipped from US so arrived much faster . They are identical in dimensions , function , everything except branding . 1 star for DOA product .	-1
Well I certainly did n't expect it to be this much of a piece of crap ... I did n't expect much due to the price ... however it was a total piece of junk . Under 3 bucks . The design and thought of it is great , however e materials and craftsmanship was null . Infused to for about 20 min before it broke . The light was bright on it and it even came with batteries but that the only thing I can say was a good about this piece of crap . I 'd return it however under 3.00 $ bucks not worth my time to return it . It came on time & the packaging was ok ... the product itself was garbage .	-1
I bought this based on the positive reviews here , and am really disappointed with it . My husband tried using it on me after I cleaned my ears , and the light is so dim that he could n't even see inside my ears . Because he could n't see , he also ended up poking me really hard in my inner ear , which was incredibly painful -- not to mention dangerous . This went right in the trash . I would recommend spending you money on a nicer product that is safer to use -- one where you do n't run the risk of inserting it too far into the ear .	-1
Worked for the original problem - in my case it appears my daughter got a bit of wood chip from the playground , or something similar , in her ear which started to be entombed in wax .. Flushes did n't work like Debrox ... And it got it out . It requires a steady hand and a very still child . Or in hindsight you could go to the doctor and they could do the same thing.After buying it however , I havent used it much b/c it tickles too much to use . And if they move while you have this in their ear- expect some crying ... : ( .So if you ca n't afford a doctor and can take the risk of jabbing this in someones ear ... go ahead . Looking back I should have just taken my kid to the doctor and just forked over the $ 100+ for the visit instead of cheaping out for $ 4.The device however does as advertised - I just feel too uncomfortable to use it .	-1
Extremely junky and stopped working after a week or so . I do n't have anything else to say but need more words .	-1
This earwax remover set looks good but does not work well . When I switched on the light , sometimes it 's on and sometimes it 's not . I regret I bought this set .	-1
I am small boned and this splint was never tight enough around my wrist and arm , thus allowing the wrist to bend too much . It looks well constructed , but I had to return it .	-1
Jarrow Formulas Vinpocetine , 100 Capsules is not a vegetarian product.Other companies use cellulose capsules that do not contain any animal byproducts . Jarrow Formulas is using gelatin capsules . I had assumed that gelatin capsules had been phased out because none of my other supplements use them.If you are vegetarian , you should avoid this product and probably anything else made by Jarrow Formulas.In the future , I will be buying a vinpocetine supplement that does not contain gelatin .	-1
I seem to get a racing mind feeling and headaches when I use Vinpocentine . I have therefor discontinued use of this product . I ca n't tell you if it made my brain work any better , however my discomfort undoubtedly overshadowed any increases in mental performance . *******Update************I have since tried Vinpo from other manufacturers and not had any of the same problems .	-1
I began taking Candex as instructed in the label , on empty stomach , to get rid of candida . My tongue got whiter , my toes and hands began peeling . I stopped Candex for about a month or two , but the advertisements about it are so persuasive that I decided to give it another chance . The same thing happened . I do n't know why Candex and similar enzymes do that to me.Truly , I do eat everything I want , especially deserts , but I also eat what candida hates such as oregano , greens , garlic , ginger , etc and I feel a lot better . I feel that I do better without Candex . I do believe that the business messed up here . Candida is really not a plant . It is a fungus . Fungus grows on plants . I do n't think Candex has the ability to kill candida . Not in my case . In addition , Candex is supposed to have no die off effects . This time my bottle is in the trash . Stick to a more green diet , there 's no way around it .	-1
Heard good things about this product from another woman . It worked ok for her.Did not do much for me . On another hand , controlling yeast balance in a natural way is challenging for many women and there is still no sure-fire solution .	-1
This gave me a yeast infection , not sure if that is supposed to happen . I stopped taking it . I didnt see any other results so I would not try it again .	-1
I was happy to find these , seems like a good company with quality fish oils , and with all 3 omegas for kids , that 's tough to find . But check out the adult caps . Both the adult and kids caps are about the same price , with a dose being two caps for both . Here 's the rub : The adult dose is EXACTLY TWICE that of the junior.So if you just give your child one of those caps , you get the EXACT SAME DOSE as two of the kids caps . And remember , same price for 180 caps . Give your child two of the juniors , or one of the adults.It 's basically a marketing rip of here . You 're paying TWO TIMES for the exact same lemon-flavored omegas . This really irritates me , so I checked the labels for other kids and adult comparisons . Same thing.While this in no way detracts from the product 's integrity , it DOES detract from the company 's integrity . So I will most likely not be buying again.Also , it does not not not taste like a lemon drop .	-1
It does n't work ! It 's just like you did n't put any on at all . I smelled like BO ! I actually smelled myself and I shower everyday . Also my pits felt like they were on fire .	-1
I 'm really not sure if this is the same product . It does not look like the one advertised or the one I 've used in the past . This one was blue . I 'm not sure if it 's just updated packaging ? Unfortunately , it also does n't seem to work as well .	-1
I 've been using Tom 's apricot , long-lasting brand deoderant for several years . Lately , it 's been burning my armpits when I start to sweat . It hurts so bad that I have to rush home , wash it off , use alcohol as a solvent to dissolve what ever is left , and stop using any deoderant for several days until the skin heals . There is a red inflamed ring around my armpits and peeling ( though I think it is the glue nature of the deooderant peeling but may include skin as well as other people are claiming ) .I do n't know why sometimes it 's fine , while other times it burns without mercy ! I 've thrown all of them away . I have one lavender stick that I will try- but even this scent has the zinc ricinoleate and hops ingredients that other people are saying cause rash . Looking online , I 've found almost a hundred posts from other people having the same burning and peeling reaction.The reason I chose Tom 's was because aluminum anti-perspirant makes me itch very badly . So , now I have to find another alternative deoderant.They pride themselves ( and are selling themselves ) based on the fact that they do n't test on animals . Well , it seems they are not doing much testing at ALL if many people are getting hurt from their product and yet they still sell without skin-rash warning label on their product .	-1
This deodorant is aluminum free , but the first ingredient listed on the label says , propolyne glycol , which is very toxic , and is found in almost all grooming products.This substance absorbs quickly into the skin and will eventually do major damage in the body . It can cause breast cancer and tumors . Women , if you use this substance , you are hurting your body big time . I contacted the seller and wanted to return this product , and seller responded quickly . Seller is good , but product is still toxic . Do you want to be aluminum free but propolyne tainted ? Not me .	-1
This deodorant was not a good choice for me . My skin is fairly sensitive and it caused my skin to become very irritated and actually started peel . If I had to apply it more than once a day ( say after an afternoon shower ) it would burn my underarms . Forget about shaving your armpits and then applying - it was like I was rubbing my armpits with alcohol . I definitely smelled fresh but this is not something I could everyday - very irritating .	-1
I switched from `` regular '' deodorants to the natural ones because we shifted all of our products we eat and use in that direction . Regular deodorants never made me break out or caused burning , but this one was bad . It burned pretty bad for almost an hour , even after washing it off with soap and water . My wife 's pits were left stained ( not her shirt , but her actual skin was stained ) and she had lots of small bumps.We are switching to Aubrey Organics deodorant , and we might try Weleda as well . Deodorant is one of the trickiest products to find a natural/organic replacement for , and one of the last products left we do n't have a favorite for yet.5.cl	-1
I hate it when you want to like a product , but just cant . Ive been using this the past week and it only lasts about half the day , and then you smell like bo . Keep in mind i work in a call center so im really not that active . Also it burns if you use it after shaving , is twice the price of dove ( which i love ) , and i think it clogged my pores . My pits are hard feeling and sore . My boyfriend also tried it and it made his skin red , flakey , and inflammed . Kinda ironic when the `` naturel '' deotorant gives you a bad reaction but the `` toxic '' stuff does not !	-1
I do n't consider myself having sensitive skin . On my quest for an effective , all-natural deodorant , I chose to try this Tom 's . Not only does it not work whatsoever against odor ( I had to reapply several times daily even when at rest ) , but it caused a burning rash which resulted in peeling , redness , and sensitivity for a week after I quit using it .	-1
When I first started using this deodorant , it seemed pretty okay . The scent was nice until maybe 6 hours after applying , so I 'd do another couple of swipes . No big deal ! But after maybe 3 days of wearing this stuff , I noticed that my armpits were peeling ... Like , extreme sunburn kind of peeling - there was a lot of skin coming off ! So , I switched to another deodorant for a while , but left it somewhere and had to turn back to Tom 's . It happened the same way , where I was fine with two applications , but after a few days the peeling started . This time , instead of just peeling , my armpits also burned . They felt like they were on fire when I shaved ! Needless to say , I switched to another deodorant.I ca n't say this happens with all Tom 's deodorants , I just know of it with Lavender . From what it sound like from others , the lavender is very strong and will make your armpits hell if you have sensitive skin . Honestly , I would n't try it even if my skin was n't sensitive ! Try one of their other scents , like apricot , instead .	-1
I have old fashioned tweezers and I was trying to 'modernize ' my arsenal . I could easily get an 'Anthony Davis ' ( Kentucky ) type unibrow if I do n't tame the beast bi-monthly . Which I do by going to a waxing place and having them clean up the brows . However , sometimes I just need to do it myself and the tweezers are time consuming . Gave this a try ... not worth my time . Not consistent and did n't give me the results I needed . Usually give pretty good reviews on most products but this one stood out as a bad one unfortunately .	-1
This product is n't easy to use or clean , and its quite painful . It did not retard hair growth . It did not do a thorough job ; hand tweezing was required afterwards . Tried it on my legs , too ; another disappointment .	-1
reminds me of that Cheap Gift given with a & # 34 ; wait but theirs More & # 34 ; item	-1
After reading all the information I could find about this product I decided it was worth a try . I 'm still trying ... I bought it mostly for the hair on the upper lip but I can only do a very small section at a time because it HURTS LIKE H -- - ! ! I can not even imagine getting close to a bikini line with this device . It 's not returnable either because to return it you have to leave it in that terrible , indestructible , plastic packaging so you ca n't find out how it works until you have destroyed that . This is the first Amazon product that I have not been satisfied with so I 'm crushed .	-1
I ca n't believe I fell for this again , since I tried the Epilady years ago and returned it , and this is the same thing , only smaller . I can rub it all over my chin for five minutes , and it wo n't pull out any coarse black hairs , so what 's the point ? Every so often I feel a sharp sting , so it must get a fine hair that 's just the right length at times . So , in the end , I still have to tweeze every day . Seems kind of pointless .	-1
I bought this to use on my neck and chest hair ( This was before Groupon had laser hair removal deals for $ 90 ) . I followed the instructions precisely and this piece of garbage did absolutely nothing . If you want better results for the same price , go buy a lighter , and what ever change is left over , use said lighter to light on fire . You could also use the same lighter to burn off the hairs you were planning on tweezing .	-1
I bought this thinking it was something else . This did not work as well as the other and caused me some problems . I would not buy this again .	-1
I admittedly did not buy this in an effort to occasionally drip cayenne on something to add flavor , I actually wanted it for effect . I wanted it to add heat or bite to food in a way that regular hot sauce did n't . This product does not do that.In fact , with the quality of the product in mind , this product appears to have no purpose . I can find any hot sauce for the same price or less than the cost of this bottle that provides more cayenne per drop than the contents of this . The alcohol does not stop the cayenne from being hot , the alcohol mixes with the cayenne oils and makes direct ingestion of this disgusting . The cayenne content in the liquid is so small as to be able to take a single cayenne pill and get more out of it . Putting it on food to create bite alters the taste of the food significantly and not in a good way , and does n't even give bite.Taking into account all aspects of this product , I do n't understand what it is for.Save your money .	-1
I got these for my kids , but they were so horrible that each of us only ate one and then went out and just bought gummies at the store . Yuck !	-1
I never get UTIs , but I got in the ocean when there was a warning out for high levels of bacteria . I did n't know about the warning until the next day . So anyway , I ordered this because I do n't do medication . Natural remedies almost always work for me , but I took this and another type of D-mannose for over a month with no relief . I could n't take it anymore , and went to the doctor yesterday . $ 200 later , I have an anti-biotic that BETTER work . My U.A . showed some pretty serious leukocytes and stuff , so maybe I just had something that was too strong for this remedy . I hope it works for you , and I encourage you to try this or the powdered D-mannose before using an anti-biotic . Anti-biotics are terrible for the world . Diseases are getting stronger and morphing to beat them because their so widely used.The reason I 'm giving this product 1 star is because of the shipping . Like other folks that reviewed this , I had to wait 3 weeks for my product to arrive and I paid like $ 10 bucks for expedited shipping . That mean 3 days , not 3 weeks . The seller answered my raging email , but blamed it on the local carrier . Wow . Terrible .	-1
This ruins my protein drinks . It has a chemical taste but I am trying to finish it . Will not buy this again .	-1
I bought this kit thinking it was a good deal , but that turned out to not be the case . The mat after just a few weeks of use is no longer sticky and it came with a few nicks in it . I fixed the nicks with tape and I thought oh that 's not so bad , but then I slid down the mat doing downward dog and hurt my shoulder , ouch ! I would say buy everything separate and save yourself the pain . The blocks and the strap are good just not the mat . My old mat I had for 10 years before it finally lost it 's stickiness . It cost me $ 20 . What a deal .	-1
I decided to take up yoga and really knew nothing about what I needed , except that I needed a mat . I bought this after looking at a few other offerings . I 've used it for about 3 months now and this is my review.When I first took the mat to class I found it to be a little slippery . My instructor said that this is common with new mats and suggested I soak it in a soapy water filled bathtub overnight . She said that they sometimes have a coating on them from the manufacturing process . I actually put it in my side loading clothes washer and used the `` hand wash '' cycle . ( do n't try this in a top loader , it will probably destroy the mat ) . The washer did the trick and the slipperiness went away . The mat is thin , but not thinner than most others I see in class . When we do poses that require us to put pressure on the knees , sometime I put a towel under my knee . The matt itself does n't provide a lot cushion . However , I read that thicker mats can make it more difficult to balance on , for example when you are doing one-legged poses.The blocks are very light and work well . If you are just starting out in yoga , and not very flexible , you really want to have blocks . Invest in a set if you do not buy a `` kit '' like this . They allow you to do some poses that you might not be able to do otherwise.I have n't used the strap yet , but I 'm not sure how much you can say about a simple strap . I 'm sure it works.The case ( bag ) can hold the mat and both blocks . However the material is very thin . After a couple of weeks , the stitching started to separate on mine . I need to either re-sew it before it completely comes apart or buy a sturdier one.Overall , other than the problems with the case , I 'm satisfied with my purchase . It has everything you need to start out in yoga , at a very reasonable price.UPDATE - When my bag stitching started to rip I thought that I had must received a poorly made one . However , my daughter bought the same set , and the stitching on her bag is starting to come apart as well , after a couple of weeks of use . While I still think the mat and blocks are OK , the bag , in my opinion , is poorly made . I have change my rating from 4 stars to 2 based on the issues we had with the bag .	-1
The Duro-Med Therabeads Neck Pain Relief Pack with its adjustable velcro closure is one I am using as I type this review . The velcro straps hold the pack in place while seated upright . After heating it in the microwave for two minutes , I put the cover , such as it is , on the pack and wrapped it around my neck . At first I thought it might be too hot to use but it was n't . Actually , after putting it in place , I found that it could stand to be a MUCH warmer . I reheated it twice , each time for 30 seconds , but it could have used even more heating . I put it in place . it was warm but within 5 minutes had cooled considerably , to the point of uselessness . I am not a fan of the sectioned pack preferring instead the solid one section type . The longer I 've had it on the more picky and annoying the insubstantial cover is becoming and the cooler the pack is.I MUCH prefer my old microwaveable u-shaped Bucky Hotties Neckwrap over this one because it gives me greater relief for a much longer time period . I will have to order another one . This pack was one of only two options available to me at our local medical supply source . The other was a large rectangular size with no velcro . Knowing there are better heat packs available , I would definitely not purchase this one again . When I need moist heat to help with head and neck pain , I not only want something that works , I NEED something that works well and has heat lasting at least 20-30 minutes . Pain is not good and neither is this . ~ Mrs. B .	-1
I followed the directions , but this heat pack does not seem to retain heat when put in the microwave . As per instructions , I tried heating it longer . It warns you not to overheat it and to give it a 2 hour break between uses to let the beads reabsorb moisture before reheating.My physical therapist applied a heat pack that got hotter and hotter and it felt really good to have it quite HOT and not just a bit warm . But this pack just does not seem hot enough even after heating it longer . I did spray a slight mist onto it to see if it would help some , and it did seem to help a little , but I had to be careful not to get the beads wet and just to make the outside slightly moist.I am going to see if I can find out what brand the physical therapy department uses and get one like they use .	-1
This is a horrible product , so I threw it in the trash can . It is truly a waste of money ! !	-1
I bought this product and used it as suggested . I also ate very healthy vegan while taking it . I felt no difference after taking it the 3 suggested times .	-1
I had to return this because the opening was too tight to fit over my cast . And my leg is in too much pain to struggle with it .	-1
Rarely do I write bad reviews of a product . This item definitely deserves 1 star . I used these with a Canon S2 IS camera . After about 10 shots , I get the change battery message . I use a La Crosse charger . Discharging and recharging does not help .	-1
I charged these up using one of the intelligent chargers you can buy here , and I put them into a portable light fixture . Really great power ! But about a week later I noticed the light was not bright at all , so I pulled the batteries out and one of the cells was dead . I checked the resistance and it was shorted .	-1
I have used sanyo eneloop 's for a few years , but thought I 'd try these sony 's because they claim to be have higher mAh 's than the eneloop's.The eneloop 's will last 10-11 hours in my MP3 , but the Sony 's last anywhere from 8 minutes to 50 minutes . We 've charged them 4 times with the same result . If the vendor will not take them back , we will throw them out , it 's just too much hassle to change batteries in the middle of exercising , etc . all the time . Our charger is a Panasonic BQ-390 , which is an excellent smart charger.Do n't waste your time with these Sony batteries .	-1
This is an important review , so please ready everything.Last month , Amazon offered these batteries from a vendor using their fulfillment shipping center . When I made my purchase , the batteries arrived in different packaging that was green and silver ( suspicious ! ) , and did not hold a charge for longer than a week.After working directly with Sony ( today ) for a warranty replacement , they are sending me the true orange and silver versions , where the charge lasts over a month when comparing my previous batch.These batteries are excellent if you receive the authentic Sony product , and will last about 5 years with consistent use . Highly recommended , yet be forewarned not to accept a version other than the orange and silver labeling as the picture indicates .	-1
These batteries do n't last long . They need to be recharged all the time and pretty much stop working after a couple months .	-1
They should say this is for children & Hobbits . This is only 17 inches long which is long enough to fit both knees on it only if you press your knees tightly together . If not , you can expect one leg to fall off.If you are a normal size adult , I would recommend the 8 inch knee wedgeDuro-Med Ortho Bed Wedge with Blue Polyester/Cotton Cover , 8 x 20 x 24or the 10 inch knee wedge10 '' x 20 '' x 30 1/2 '' Ortho Bed Wedge . Or , tryMabis/DMI healthcare Elevating Leg Rests , Bluewhich is the longer version of this knee pillow . Check the dimensions prior to purchase whichever one you chose . It would also probably be helpful if you folded up some blankets to simulate the different heights to see which pillow works best for you .	-1
I 've been dealing with Back issues for 12 yrs now and have gone threw SO many bolsters & wedges trying to find one that is high enough and firm enough . I ca n't seem to find both in ONE item . This was perfect in length but after a wk of having it under your knees it flattens to almost level with your legs . The foam would need to be higher or if the foam was harder it would have been fine . Unfortunately Im stuck with it and am off in search of another . If anyone knows of one please let me know .	-1
It 's pretty bulky and it seems to be too high for me . The construction seems to be OK , however . My wife uses it on occasion .	-1
This , unfortunately , was a complete waste of money ( and I like you have to watch every penny ) . Am dealing with L4-5 herniated discs with the lovely accompanying sciatica ( because that 's where the sciatic nerve comes out ) .So have been using pillows and thought this Leg Rest would work . Yes I read that it was short in length . And it is , but that actually was n't an issue for me . The issue for me are the angles - the side where it goes to the slant and the top `` point '' . The side cuts into the back of the thigh , the top ? feels like it 's cutting into the backs of my poor knees ! And it 's not high enough to take any pressure off the back.So this , after trying a few times ( with a towel wrapped around it ) will be going to the thrift store . Maybe someone can find a use for it . I sure ca n't .	-1
These are way too thin for any use beyond human skin to skin contact . Almost worthless in the shop for automotive or paint solvent use .	-1
If you have an ant farm and need pads that are small enough to polish the shoes of your ants , than this package is for you . For all others , there are much bigger and better pads out there for the same money .	-1
Saw so many good reviews so I bought the biggest bottle . Yeah , not really worth it . Kerasal still does a better job but much more costly for exfoliation . There are better moisturizing creams out there also , like Eucerin or anything really thick . Applying any lotion to my feet and wearing socks would do the same job as this stuff . I expected more . And I did not care for the scent at all . Still working my way through the GIANT bottle I bought and ca n't afford to through away . *sigh*	-1
No bett than any other regular lotion I 've used on my feet . I did n't see anything miraculous happen . Jus basic moisturizing .	-1
This product was recommended to me by a doctor so I tried it out . I ended up giving it away because it was really strong . Both in smell and in my system .	-1
I bought this to try instead of the Penetrex which is what I usually use . Both my husband and I have issues that this could work for and it came in a nice big bottle with a pump top so I figured why not . The pump works well and the smell is not unpleasant . Almost instantly it makes your skin feel cool and wet it 's not a bad feeling . We went to bed and about an hour later I woke up in extreme agony feeling like my skin was burning like chemical burns but deep down I had little red bumps on my skin but the pain was so deep I did n't know what to do . I kept running cold water over my calf and lower back where I had applied it and it would help for short periods of time and then would come right back . It lasted about an hour and then finally died down enough I was able to fall asleep but wow I was not expecting that . I am sharing this because the product should be tested in a small area first unlike me who just slopped it on immediately trying to dull my pains . My Husband was completely fine . I 'm a bit scared to try it again but if for some reason I do I 'll do a very very small spot first .	-1
I am very disappointed with this product . I use the Sombra Cool therapy roll on gel and love that . The reason I do n't like this warm therapy gel is because 1. the product barely comes out ; you have to roll the heck out of it , shake it or do whatever it takes for the product to come out , and 2. it does n't get warm . Period . I felt I wasted my money on this product . Lesson learned : Stick with the ones that work -- like their cool therapy roll on gel .	-1
This did n't really do anything for me . At least it did not do any harm , so I give it an extra star for that feat .	-1
I ordered this product based upon the reviews , but I wish I had n't . It does n't provide any real relief for my stiff joints or pain in my knee . The pump dispenser is the reason for the 2 stars , because it is convenient . I 'll add some additional pain relieving essential oils to this product to try to improve it , so that it does n't go to waste . I definitely would n't recommend this to anyone that has very stiff joints or more severe pain . Actually , I would n't recommend it period .	-1
I was really looking forward to using this product so I ignored reviews that mentioned a faulty roller ball . I should n't have ! Even trying to shake the bottle in between applications did not help-the roller ball was dry about 75 % of the time . It was very frustrating to use and I am returning this product .	-1
Frankly , this was not an especially helpful DVD and it should have been included with the product itself . Well , I say that even though I got a Body Back Buddy rather than a Theracane . But I thought -- correctly , I believe -- that the principles would be approximately the same . I think that the BBB has more helpful features and a better design than the Theracane . I have messed around with both and would recommend the BBB slightly over the Theracane , though I think that either will provide exceptional therapy not just for anyone who is dealing with chronic soft tissue pain , but for anyone who just wants to relieve tension.The DVD is pretty poorly made and they work through the various uses of the Theracane or its equivalents ( like the Body Back Buddy ) . But despite the very low production values and the poor presentation , you do get an idea of the proper way to use your therapy tool . I realized I was making a couple of mistakes and after adjusting things I got much better results . I also got a better idea of how to use a couple of the knobs on the BBB.So , do I recommend this ? I 'm not sure . I learned a bit from it , but not a great deal . I suppose I do n't recommend against buying it , but I 'm not much of a fan of it either . I more strongly recommend one of the several excellent pressure point books that currently in print .	-1
It was my first vibrator and it broke in the first use . I did everything correct , but it broke.I would not recommend it .	-1
Too big ... .and I 've had 2 kids.. yucky smell . Discolored after awhile and I tossed it . Save your money . I would also recommend measuring your partner or current toy for size .	-1
I am soooo disappointed in this POS ! I bought a really cheap one off Amazon and it worked better than this ... .but the cheap plastic broke after only a few months so either way it sucks . This one I tried once and it was the most frustrating sexual experience of my life ! I can usually get off in 30 seconds or less with my other pocket rocket style vibrators . I was still trying after 5 minutes ( which seemed like an eternity ! ) and with each second of it getting me nowhere I got more and more angry the point I almost threw it against the wall ... but I did n't , I just threw it in the trash . After looking at it though I noticed that it 's not even the right logo on the front so it could be a knock off . So , besides being WEAK , it is hard to twist open & closed/off & on . And remember that there are no returns on products like this ( that would be nasty anyway ) , so make sure you buy from a trusted seller ( NOT PLEASURE ISLANDS ) , and do your investigating , or you might just end up throwing your money in the trash like I did ... literally !	-1
There are a lot of good reviews here on Resperate . A number of them sound so good they could have been `` placed '' here by the manufacturer.Look , I have no doubt that Resperate will make a reduction happen for many people who use it , because the idea is sound . It 's based on good science-that meditation reduces blood pressure readings.But let 's take a look at what you get here . This is basically a $ 30 Chinese CD player being sold with a built in `` tune '' for $ 300 . It is NOT a quality product . I used it for two months , got a small reduction in my blood pressure readings . But the first unit I received was defective within a week , and the second one looked like it was going to have the same problems . Physically , it is not made well . It 's chintzy . And when I spend $ 300 for an electronic device , MAN that thing had better be cool , and really made well . In this case , the little plastic piece that has the digital readout on it came off , the earphone jack had to be held in only a certain way in order to work , and the cheazy little monitor thing that goes around your chest is actually hard-wired right into the case , which is crazy because it is prone to shorting out . So , in short , you 'd have to be really nutty to keep this thing after the 30 day evaluation because its `` self-destruct '' mode starts kicking in about then . The company has a great $ 100 product here , but they put an extra $ 200 into the retail price so that they could promote the heck out of it . Even the headphones that come with it are so cheaply made that they fall apart faster than the units that they give away in airline seats.What you get with Resperate is something that you could have for free just by sitting in a chair and slowing down your breathing . What you DO N'T get is quality . This is a device equivalent to what you 'd get for $ 25 or $ 30 in a WalMart if you were buying some kind of electronic gadget . Cheazy and without any similarity to something worth $ 300 . And for those who believe that the blood pressure result is what you are paying for , and not the unit itself , you can get EXACTLY the same results by spending $ 20 on a meditation/breathing CD and listening to it an hour or two a week .	-1
All this box does is make tones to slow down your breathing . I looked at it for a long time , I never found a clear explanation of what it actually is . So I tried it and it seems like it should cost about $ 11.99 . Save your money .	-1
I am a male `` senior citizen '' in generally good health.I own a home blood pressure monitor ( Omron HEM 711DX ) purchased from Amazon . Some months ago , I noticed that my top blood pressure number was frequently over 150 , too high even for my age ( the bottom number has never been an issue ) .I started by reading virtually everything I could find on the web about `` hypertension '' ( high blood pressure ) .My ultimate observation was that most of the articles appeared either to be copied from other articles ; or were essentially paid-for endorsements for medication , devices or processes ( meditation/hypnosis DVDS and books ) ; or might be good for general health but not necessarily related to blood pressure ( DASH diet ) . Most had very little if any statistical basis behind their recommendations . Indeed , I was amazed at how little solid information there seemed to be about bringing down blood pressure levels and how much was apparently recycled or based on trial and error.After a physical exam and consultation , my doctor suggested a major reduction in my salt intake ( goodbye to - Chinese takeout ; fast-food ` burgers and fries ; `` salty '' snacks ; bacon ; lox ; all restaurant soups ; etc ) . With this diet change plus the few pounds it took off , my top number dropped to the 135-140 range most of the time and it stuck there.I had read about Resperate on the web . Although some reviewers said it was `` too expensive '' compared to co-payments for medication , my sense was that virtually anything that could lower my blood pressure but do no real harm was preferable to medication with its doctor 's visits and potential side effects . When one of the major warehouse stores with a liberal return policy had a mail-order Resperate sale , I decided to buy one.I had hoped Resperate would take perhaps 10 points off the top blood pressure number ; for me , that would have been a spectacular result.However , this did not happen . As best I can determine , Resperate did absolutely nothing at all either to or for my blood pressure ! I used Resperate every day for a month . I usually had 13 or 14 minutes in the `` under 10 breaths per minute '' zone with a final rate between 4.8 and 5.5 . The other numbers were also good . Last week , I spoke with the company who confirmed that I was doing everything according to instructions.My conclusions are : -Slow , deep breathing for 10 to 15 minutes per day may have its own benefits , but the link between that activity and blood pressure is tenuous at best . I know it is not possible to keep all other variables constant , but I took my blood pressure enough times during the day to see that there was no significant pattern change while using Resperate , even in the last week.-While some reviewers said that the `` relaxation '' alone from using Resperate may have lowered their blood pressure , I personally found that having to breathe in and out on queue was stressful , not relaxing . Even after a month , I did n't like using it . For me , it was not a form of meditation.The Resperate machine seems to be a well made and well thought out device ; mechanically , it is fine ; the documentation is good ; there is customer support - all of which combined to move it up from the lowest or 1* rating.The 2* rating above reflects performance of the product ; it did n't do what it was supposed to do - lower my blood pressure.Since , as noted , I bought the Resperate from a warehouse store with a liberal return policy , it is going back for a refund .	-1
Lasership sucks period ! 3 deliveries not received , get major lip service from customer service to provide signature on delivery . But they do n't do it and put your package wherever they feel is easiest for them . Then you have too play Joe Detective agency and knock on everyone 's door to find your packages ? ! WT-major-F ! Do n't use Lasership period ! Unless you want lip service and want to play Joe Detective with e-mails , phone calls , unfulfilled delivery promises , etc.Bill	-1
i expected for the unit to have a small fan blade to properly diffuse the essential oils . I would recommend it but it is a personal choice to choice or not choice how your car may or may not smell .	-1
I read so many reviews about this razor , unfortunately mine was not as good . After a nano second use , the razor was already clogged and it was impossible to get the few hairs out . Was expecting much more . Would not buy again .	-1
I used the Women Quattro to shave my ( blank ) area and I cut myself to pieces . I ended up buying a ( blank ) load of bandages.Schick Quattro Midnight Razor , 1 Razor	-1
I purchased the Quattro Razor and this package of 8 refill cartridges . I did n't get a close shave on my legs - after 1 day , I could feel the stubble . Perhaps these are `` seconds '' ? ? ? ? A complete waste of time and money . I have since switched to Gillette Venus - very satisfied with my choice .	-1
I find these razors to be as abrasive as cheapy disposables . Despite staying sharp for a good amount of time , even with the first use they leave my legs bumpy and itchy . I 've had much better result with the Gillette Venus .	-1
I used to have a woman 's schick quattro razor . I can tell you that it is absolutely a piece of junk ! It dulls four times faster than a man 's razor of the same model . If you enjoy working harder for more money to buy junky things and to fill our land fills this is for you . I recomend just learning to hoan and get a good straight razor . It will last literally 100 years and take up less land fill space when it finally wears out .	-1
When I buy these locally at a grocery store they do n't taste bad at all . However these get melted in delivery a little bit and do not taste the same . They are not completely disgusting , bit they are n't worth the money online . Wish I would have just returned them .	-1
& # 34 ; Fudge Brownie & # 34 ; makes you look forward to this bar . Well , do n't . It has the chemical back taste I thought had been eliminated in most meal bars . I love most other Adkins bars . I threw the last two of this flavor away rather than forcing myself to use them . GAAHG !	-1
I decided not to buy , based on the nutritional information.A lot of people are giving this product 5 stars - which I 'm sure tells the product tastes good . No problem with that ! But ... people , please be aware that just one bar has 9 grams of Saturated fat . So it 's not a very healthy/balanced bar.Just my contribution since it seems everybody is just paying attention to the taste.Look around and you 'll be able to find good bars with more balanced nutritional facts .	-1
Totally missed it on the peanut butter flavor . Just sweet , but does n't taste much like peanut butter . Also , has a bit of a chemical aftertaste . I 'm pretty forgiving with these bars , but this one I wo n't buy again .	-1
I used to love these bars , because they tasted just like a Mounds bar . The latest shipment left me disappointed . They have an unpleasant non-food aftertaste . I wo n't be buying them again . I found ChocoPerfections bars satisfy the sweet craving .	-1
I had really high hopes for these , based on other reviews . Unfortunately these bars are n't even half as good as expected - they are tasteless , very dense and mushy , and they have this weird grayish chocolate coating that is visually unappealing ( you ca n't see the coating on the box picture ... .probably for good reason ) . The only good thing about these is that they are filling , so even when you 're left completely unsatisfied by this `` treat '' as far as flavor and enjoyment , you wo n't be hungry afterwards . I would think the only way you 'll be happy with this item is if you 're generally thrilled with Little Debbie brownies .	-1
Tasty peanut butter cups . For a reason . You might as well be eating Reeses , healthwise.Why you ask ? The first ingredient of these is the Sugar Alcohol `` Maltitol '' . Maltitol is about 75 % as sweet as sugar , with about 50 % the calories and 75 % the blood sugar effect as compared to standard sugar . This information is readily available Via google or a simple Wikipedia lookup . you get the taste , the calories , the carbs , with extra potential laxitive and gas . On the plus side , its better for your teeth.So they add a little more , to make up for the sweetness , and you basically get the same dietary effect as just eating sugar . Except they can claim it as low carb or `` sugar free '' . Thus the `` deceptive '' As you examine Atkins brand products ( or really , any candy type product claiming to be `` sugar free '' ) you should keep your eyes pealed for Maltitol . There are some products without it , or at least with less of it . But if you are actually trying to live on a low carb diet , keep in mind that the Atkins Carb count is not accurate to what your body is taking in for this product .	-1
These are sugar free but way too sweet for my taste . It had a fake chocolate taste and gave me diarhea .	-1
The bars were received quickly but they were very hard . The chocolate coating had white or cream colored spots . Definitely disappointing . Maybe they were in stock too long ...	-1
I bought these bars to eat while doing the Atkins Diet . I sometimes run around all day long and do n't have time to eat.These bars are a fabulous , both as snacks and for meal replacement - delicious and satisfying.BUT ... I question whether the `` net carbs '' approach is accurate . Since beginning to consume these bars on a regular basis I 've GAINED weigh and also became super BLOATED ... to the point that I feel uncomfortable in my own skin and ca n't fit into clothes.Though high in carbs one is supposed to deduct alcohol sugars and fiber , making the `` net '' carbs very low . However , this `` net carbs '' approach is n't working for me , at least when it comes to Atkins bars . It 's a shame since I find them to be delicious.I generally have a stomach of steel but the synthetic , chemical nature of these bars apparently does n't agree with my system , which is more of a `` purist '' I guess.If you decide to try these tread slowly and see whether they agree with your body .	-1
FUNNY IN CONCEPT BUT IN REALITY , NOT SO MUCH . GAVE IT TO SOMEONE NAMED HAPPY ON HER BIRTHDAY . HA , HA , SCRATCH , SCRATCH . CHUCK IT ASIDE . TOO MUCH MONEY FOR A GIGGLE AND WIRES ON A STICK .	-1
it may just have been me and not knowing how to use this but I found that this was not a relaxing experience . The massager came compacted and you have to manually seperate each metal arm , and then when I tried to use this it jabbed into my head . I tried adjusting the arms a little and it still was very uncomfortable . I would , and do stay away from this now . Not the best purchase I have ever made .	-1
I got a horrible migraine from this `` therapeutic massager '' . I was sick for three days . It made me feel foggy -- almost like I had a seizure . People with migraines or seizure activity should be careful .	-1
I was very disappointed in this aftershave . I love the smell of sandalwood , as I have The Art Of Shaving sandalwood shaving cream , which is amazing . I was hoping for something with a similar scent to complement the shaving cream , but it was not the case . This smelled like the perfume my grandmother had in 50 year-old Avon bottles shaped like airplanes and animals . Unless I received an out-of-date or a bad batch , I can not see how this can smell good to anybody . It has a musty , moldy smell , which stays with you all day . If you want a good Sandalwood aftershave , try the Art Of Shaving sandalwood aftershave lotion . It smells exactly as it is supposed to , without the mold stench .	-1
If you read the label for this product you will see that it is in fact `` cassia '' which is not true cinnamon.Due to a toxic component in cassia called `` coumarin '' , European health agencies have warned against consuming high amounts of cassia . Cassia is the most common type of `` cinnamon '' sold in U.S. grocery stores . It is actually a different plant than cinnamon . True cinnamon is called Ceylon cinnamon and may be found online or in health stores . Be sure to read your labels as a component in cassia called `` coumarin '' may cause liver damage or be toxic in high quantities .	-1
I have used sanyo eneloop 's for a few years , but thought I 'd try these sony 's because they claim to be 900mAh ( vs. the 750-800mAh eneloop 's ) .The eneloop 's will last 10-11 hours in my MP3 , but the Sony 's last anywhere from 8 minutes to 50 minutes . We 've charged them 4 times with the same result . If the vendor will not take them back , we will throw them out , it 's just too much hassle to change batteries in the middle of exercising , etc . all the time . Our charger is a Panasonic BQ-390 , which is an excellent smart charger.Do n't waste your time with these Sony batteries .	-1
These charge and work fine , but wo n't fit into my Logitech cordless keyboard . Another rechargeable brand ( Uniross ) does , as do regular AAA Duracells that I used before I went to rechargeables .	-1
I purchased these batteries less than two years ago . The use of them was light - in a wireless keyboard . They have not been recharged anywhere near 300 times ( maybe , *MAYBE* 20 times total ) and are now showing an error after a few seconds of being placed in the Sony charger . They have not held a charge while out of the charger for more than a few days , which has left me relying on the purchase of regular batteries or twiddling my thumbs and waiting while these charge up again . I have since switched to a different brand of rechargeable batteries and am having no problems with those.I had the same type of experience with the AA version of these batteries as well - also used in a Sony charger .	-1
I bought the lcd charger along with these batteries . I 'm not sure if it 's the batteries or the charger , but they are not working well together . battery life is horrible compared to my old battery recharger/chargeable batteries . these only last a few days and they need to be recharged which takes hours then they do n't even fully charge or it states it 's fully charged when they clearly are not . very confused and disappointed on both these products . if anyone has help or experienced this as well , please comment . thanks	-1
I have used 3 different coconut oils , this being one of them , and neither of the other 2 effected me in the way this one does . I do n't know what is different about this oil , but it gives me constant , noxious gas . I am embarrased to put this in a review , but I have to be honest . I wo n't buy this kind again , for obvious reasons.I used a tablespoon in my oatmeal , every morning for a week , and I could n't figure out what was causing this irritating problem , so I stopped using the oil , and the next day it was gone . I went and boughtBarlean 's Organic Oils Extra Virgin Coconut Oil , 16-Ounce Jarfrom the store , to find out if it was just the Jarrow brand that was causing the issue , or if in fact I have developed an intolerance to coconut oil . The Barleans does n't cause this problem . I have eaten a tablespoon of it in my oatmeal all week , and nothing . I have also usedDr Bronner 's Fresh-pressed Virgin Coconut Oil White Kernel Unrefined 14 Fl Ozin the past with no problems.It makes me wonder just exactly WHAT is added to this oil , that is n't added to the other 2 . Something is clearly different about this oil , and I ca n't seem to find anything online in regards to what additional additives might or might not be in here . So , buyer beware . I do n't see mention of this annoyance in any other reviews , so perhaps I am one of the unlucky ones .	-1
coconut oil on the market but surely one of the most expensive . Plus , their customer service , regardless for whatever Jarrow product you are concerned with , is not the best either . Whole Foods organic coconut oil is of equal quality , costs much less and , WH offers excellent customer service with all products they sell .	-1
I bought this because I have never been disappointed with pyrex , until now . The liquid inside DOES in fact freeze as a solid block so however it lies in your freezer is how it will be applied . The heating instructions allow for the bag to get ... warm . I would not recommend this product .	-1
These are great when they work , but having had 2 transmitters die in less than a year , and the problem is n't the battery , I 've decided it is not worth the money .	-1
Used the old model tc31 for years with no problem . My children bought me a wearlink coded transmitter and it lasted a little over a year before it started to give me problems . At times it would take a minute of two before it would begin to work or sometimes just quit during my workout . I have replaced the battery but still have the same problem . I also had an extremely difficult time trying to remove the back cover to the transmitter . The slot looks like it has gone through heck and I may not be able to get the cover off again . I started using the old transmitter and am very happy with it . Not satisfied with the wearlink .	-1
All the canes that I presently use have the vertical shaft directly underneath the handle so I can use my thumb and forefinger to guide it . I feel like I do n't have full control of this cane . Also , the rubber-like , spongy material on the handle does n't work for me . If you have to stop and shake some sweaty hands then the handle becomes a very unsanitary breeding ground for germs.The cane is very well constructed and should last a long time . In a recent visit to the VA hospital , I noticed that the canes the VA issues are identical or nearly identical to this cane so it must have proven to be a reliable unit.I gave mine away .	-1
I have had two of these Medline reachers . At first they seem like they are heavy duty , but I have broken both of mine with seemingly ordinary use , that is not trying to pick up things too heavy or too large for it . I use it exclusively in the kitchen to retrieve things I ca n't get with my PicStik.First of all , the rubber tips came off the first one , reducing its usefulness . A short time later one of the grabber arms broke.Since I liked the style of the device I bought a second one . In less than a year the plastic bar that you pull on to close the grippers cracked and pulled out of the bar that attaches to the grabber arms . Maybe I can scavenge enough parts from each to make one complete one.I have had other grabbers far longer that have not broken . It is too bad these Chinese-made grabbers are so cheaply built , because the design is useful to me .	-1
THIS UNIT IS SO HANDY AND IT SURPRISED ME BY BEING AS STRONG AS IT IS . ITS SO USER FRIENDLY THAT I CAN EVEN PICK UP A QUARTER LYING FLAT ON THE FLOOR WITH THESE . ITS STRONG ENOUGH TO PICK UP A FULL CAN OF BEER OFF THE FLOOR ON OFF THE TOP SHELF.The handle snapped in half ! on my second use.it went from 4 stars to 1 ... . this is junk !	-1
This bathtub bar is sturdy , however , I 've noticed 2 issues that could make this a 5 star review . The rounded top of the handle would be easier to grip if it were slightly flattened and/or had some sort of rubber piece to prevent slipping . I nearly fell the other day getting out of the tub when my hand slid over the side . Otherwise , I would have given this item 5 stars .	-1
I had this product for little over 6 months . Worked great for about 5 months and thats when we started seeing problems . The chair legs started to bend ( made up of some cheap aluminium material ) . I removed the screws , removed the bend and fix it up , but its of no use . The chair is totally useless now and I am returning it ... wo n't get a full refund , but its okay . I 'll never again buy any product from Medline .	-1
This stool was very stable for the first couple of months . But the nuts had to be tightened at increasingly short intervals until it was too scary to use anymore . We are not overweight . Plus , keeping it clean was difficult . I would still like to have a bath stool but wo n't replace this one with a similar one .	-1
I returned it to the vender asap . It was way , way , way too bulky and cumbersome to live with on a daily basis .	-1
hey Amazon ! Pictured are THREE DIFFERENT STYLES of rollators ! Also missing from the ad is a CRITICAL measurement for walker ... the seat height.I 'd consider buying this but I am disabled enough hto know that I have no clue of what would show up . Except what color ... .	-1
This seems to be a good rollator , but was a big waste of money for my elderly relative . He lives in a house with both interior and exterior stairs , and this is too heavy to him to lift up and down those stairs.Also , it does n't fold as compactly as other Medline rollators . There is only one folding axis between the two sets of legs -- barely reducing the size and footprint compared to the fully open position .	-1
I dunno , for $ 16 , imported from Italy , I expected something ... special . Its ok , but seems not that much different from local cheaper brands to me . ( Maybe I 'm just not sophisticated enough to tell the difference ... )	-1
I use many Proraso products , but this one was a disappointment . It seems to be the exactly the same product as , `` Nivea for Men Sensitive Post Shave Balm , Active Comfort System . `` This aftershave has a very liquid consistency , it looks like milk . The liquid consistency makes it difficult to coat the face.To make matters worse it irritates my skin after applied , OUCH ! This product does not sting , rather within 3 minuets of applying it the skin turn red and raw . Also somehow this lotion opens up previous closed nicks , YUK ! I am absolutely amazed how bad this product is , especially considering how great other Proraso products are.And yes ... the Nivea product mention above gets the same review as this Proraso item .	-1
Wow , where to start ? From a positive standpoint , this lotion smells great and applies easily , evenly , and it is n't sticky . The problems lie in that it does n't do much as an aftershave at all.First of all , this stuff is very greasy , and it made me break out like crazy . I could n't believe how many pimples I would get by mid afternoon when I would use this ; I was in disbelief in light of the overwhelmingly positive reviews.Secondly , the glass container it comes in has seriously got ta go . There is no reason why in 2012 we should be bothering to extract a thick lotion like this from a glass bottle , no reason at all . I do n't care how old-fashioned you liked to think you are , there 's a point at which outmoded ideas become impractical , and this is a perfect example.Lastly , although it 's a fairly potent lotion , it does n't stick around long enough to moisturize throughout the day . In a nutshell , this product fails at all of the most important aspects of an aftershave balm . It 's too bad , because although I 've finally found an adequate replacement that does everything right that Proraso gets wrong , this stuff STILL has the best fragrance I 've used . I hate colognes and aftershaves with strong , overbearing fragrances , and the mild but pleasant scent of this balm is more or less perfect for me .	-1
Triethanolamine ( one of the ingredients use by Castle Forbes ) has been associated with `` cancer , allergies/immunotoxicity , organ system toxicity ( non-reproductive ) , contamination concerns '' and gets a 5 out of 10 at the Skin Deep database for toxicity earning it a `` moderate toxicity '' tag . It is also a known skin irritant and contact allergen . Seems like something we should be working to ban from the face of earth , not smearing on our faces every morning.The ever growing `` Organic '' section in my grocery store suggests more and more people are begining to care about what 's in the stuff they buy . For example , Pacific Shaving Company 's allowed several Amazon reviewers of their All Natural Shaving Oil replacements when one of them discovered the formula had n't been all natural ( the old product was just pulled from Amazon ) . I chose not to buy a product I similarly found included a known toxin ( even if it is a toxin commonly used by shaving cream formulas ) and thought people had a right to know ( perhaps , need to know ) .Dr . Lauren Devill recommends avoiding Triethanolamine - [ Google `` avoid Triethanolamine linked with certain cancers found in all kinds of beauty products '' or `` Dr Lauren Deville tucson citizen Triethanolamine '' ] Dr. Samuel Epstein ( Professor of Environmental Health at the University of Illinois ) says that repeated applications of DEA-based detergents result in major increases in liver and kidney cancer .

some kids like it , some kids do n't . i would n't suggest buying a TWO-pack , though , if you do n't know for sure . my kid 's anemic , like me , so i need to give her iron drops every day . impossible to do if it tastes nasty . and my kid eats ANYTHING . she 's not picky at ALL , and we 've introduced her to all kinds of crazy ethnic foods , so if she hates this stuff , i trust her.plus my doc said that this stuff has less iron concentration than straight iron . seems obvious , now , duh . so i give my kid the iron drops from Rugby . she likes it .	-1
My toddler is a picky eater so I thought this supplement was a good idea . Turns out , it was n't . I am pretty upset that I spent $ 12 for a bottle ( at a local retailer ) , because it 's half full and is going in the trash . The gas was mild the first night ( about 30 minutes of fussing , I thought maybe she 's just having a bad night ) , which is why I did not think much of it at first . Within 48 hours of starting this supplement in the evening bottle ( whole milk or juice ) my 2-year-old started screaming for HOURS from gas pains ! Painful screams , I mean at the top of her lungs . I would try everything to burp her and it seemed she just could n't get enough out , she would just cry and scream , her stomach bloated , it was absolutely awful . She had dozens of small burps and several super loud ones , it really felt like it was never-ending . Her behavior was completely normal except for at night after her regular bottle , so I knew she was not sick . I dealt with this for two weeks before I thought to look at the reviews here and read about upset stomachs . I thought that may be it , and discontinued use - that first night she was back to her old self , no gas pains , small burp immediately , straight to bed she went . It has been a week and we have had no issues.This supplement may not work for you so if you decide to try it , I would not advise getting a 2-pack . However , I do not recommend this at all . Aside from the awful gas , it stains ( clothes , the nipples , even the bottles ) , it smells , and the taste is awful !	-1
Bought some from Walgreens as I was trying to find something my 2 1/2 year old would take since I ca n't put it in his milk . Smells worse than the ferrous sulfate I get from CVS . Basically 1mL was used and now I 'm not going to use it anymore .	-1
First , I do n't think it 's very nutritious . It has 250 calories with 34 carbs and 9 grams of fat . The ingredients are horrible with corn syrup being the very first ingredient.It did n't mix well and ours had clumps in it that we could n't get out with stirring . Maybe a blender would work better . It also had that disgusting powder flavor . It was watery and not very rich tasting.I 've used other shake mixes in the past like Slim Fast that were delicious tasting.This is definitely a big no for us . The kids would n't even finish it .	-1
I was not aware of the contents of this product when I requested it from the Vine program . I have no doubt that this is a nutritional benefit to those who need help . I personally can not consume this powder . Forks over Knives is my diet regimen and I avoid Ensure ingredients such as fat , sodium , sugar and especially cholesterol.I give this product one star based solely on my specific inability to consume some of the contents . I not suggesting that it is a bad product just that I ca n't use it for the reasons stated . However , if you are on a plant based diet which avoids meat , dairy products and eggs then you may want to consider whether this product meets your standards .	-1
I have used a lot of meal replacement drinks , especially during certain months of the year when I spend a lot of time in my car . It is so easy to pull one out of my cooler and so much healthier than the ever-so-easy drive-thrus . Almost any of the drinks are a good idea , even though this one only has 9 mg protein.This one has the distinction of being kind of flavorless . It caused me to think about the old idea of white ice cream , from before the vanilla flavor seemed so significant - like white meant the absence of flavor.I was able to avoid the powdery and clumpy side effects by using aBlenderBottle Classic 28-ounce Black . * One can makes 7 servings of 250 calorie 8 ounce drinks ( ! ) . * It has 15-30 % DV of most vitamins except 60 % of vitamin C.* One 8 ounce serving has 190 mg Sodium . ( 8 % DV ) * One 8 ounce serving has 34 g carbs /13 g sugars* The first ingredient is Corn Syrup.These are all things that I would have noticed if I had picked the can up in the store . Then I would have put the can back on the shelf .	-1
It was a pain to mix up and the result tasted warm , gloppy , and unpleasant . Sorry but this one 's not for me .	-1
While I prefer the taste of Boost brand nutrition drinks , I have had the Ensure bottles several times . I always feel wasteful purchasing and tossing out individual serving plastic bottles of any beverage . They are also quite expensive so I decided to give this `` nutrition '' powder a try.The instructions say to gradually add 1/2 cup of Ensure powder to 3/4 cup of cold water and stir until dissolved . This takes too long . It is better to use a shake bottle or the blender ( I used my magic bullet blender ) . The blender definitely gives you a smoother drink . The instructions also say for Flavor Variety , you may add chocolate syrup or strawberry syrup . This does n't seem very advisable to me considering that one serving already gives you a whopping 13 grams of sugar . This sugar source is from corn syrup ( FIRST listed ingredient ) , corn maltodextrin and sugar . One is better off adding fresh strawberries or unsweetened cocoa powder for flavor variety.The overall taste is fine . I think it could use some more of the vanilla flavor . I actually added some real vanilla extract to improve it . The bottled versions taste better.According to the Nutrition Facts on the label , one 14 oz can will yield 7 servings . You will save money purchasing the powder versus the bottled versions if you do n't mind forsaking the convenience of a pre-mix.Because of the high sugar content I would n't make this product a mainstay in my home . I would probably just buy an unflavored protein powder and add that to soy or almond milk and fresh fruit to make my own drinks . I do n't like corn by products and there is nothing on the label that states the product is non-GMO . I would give it a 1-star based on the ingredient list alone but I do n't think this product is any worse than any of the other nutrition shake brands .	-1
Not crazy about the taste of this . Why are products like this so sweet ? The first three ingredients listed are sweeteners . I was also fairly surprised to see how much -- 1/2 a cup -- you need to use for 8 oz of water . Most protein powders and nutritional supplements require half that amount per serving . I 'm not sure it 's worth it unless you or someone you care for is n't getting adequate nutrition because of a medical issue .	-1
A fat pecentage reading does n't have to be truly -accurate- to be valuable , as long as readings are -consistant- . How fat you supposedly are is just a number ; if the machine reads out '30 ' when it should readout '40 ' , that 's ok , as long it goes up or down proportionately , according to whether you gain or lose fat.This scale is all over the map , no help at all , neither accurate nor consistant .	-1
I used this vitamin for five days and I started getting headaches and body weakness . the headaches and weakness starts two hours after I toke this vitamin pill , I stopped it , and my life went back to normal the next day . better off buying fresh fruits and juices , between this life killer and other vitamins with Gelatin , I 'm better off with God 's natural creations .	-1
This multivitamin has the most desirable 'natural ' and absorbable forms of vitamins ONLY ON PAPER AND IN THEORY . This vitamin is not absorbed by the body ( firstly - its in the tablet form which has undesired 'binders ' ... capsules are much better delivery methods for supplements as has been proven by research - but more importantly - I have tried other tablets that actually work to varying degrees unlike this one which does not work at all for me beneficially ) . Try doing the solubility test like some other reviewers have done and see for yourself . Quoting one such review - `` After a full hour in vinegar at ~100 deg F , the pill was not fully dissolved . '' I can attest to this from personal experience . All the so called good stuff is useless if it is not absorbed by the system.However , for me , it was even worse than having no effect . Far from supplementing , my health and energy took a definite downward plunge ( enervation , weight loss ( I am a hard gainer and this is the worst that can happen to one ) ) every time I used this product . I gave it several tries just to be sure that the negative effects were not for any other factor or supplement that I was taking and also to see whether this does benefit me after a while . However , after several retries , there is no question now at all that it is the Rainbow Light Vitamin that 's causing the harm . I have no idea why it had that negative effect on me - I would have expected a 'no-effect ' at worst but this proved to be even worse . Now - to be fair , I would attribute this negative effect to my personal chemistry rather than any harmful ingredient in this vitamin which I believe is not present , but the point that I would still make is that these vitamins do not absorb in your body to have any benefit.I have tried other highly raved multivitamins ( Twinlab Daily One With Iron , Optimen ) here on Amazon and ALL of them work FAR better for me . Try Optimen - you will throw away these vitamins after the very first few days . They ACTUALLY make you feel stronger and better rather than just publishing a long list of 'quality natural ingredients ' in theory and merely giving you a psychological satisfaction of using a 'quality supplement ' but delivering no results in reality .	-1
I was getting some weird headaches when I started taking these vitamins . I did n't even think it was the vitamins until I read another reviewer here . I 'm not allergic to anything . Just be careful . I went back to my trusty cheap men one a days . Never had a vitamin issue before in my life.Update : My headaches did go away after I stopped taking these vitamins .	-1

Most vitamins and meds do n't mess up my stomach . The only way this did n't mess up my stomach was if I was completely full . A glass of milk or a small breakfast was n't ever enough . I was disappointed since I thought this brand was geared toward being easy on your stomach . Their prenatal vitamins were good but not these .	-1
I have a supplement regiment which I have been faithful to since 1992 . I have learned on the path to balance , certain synthesis work better than others . Obviously , I am speaking for my own chemistry.I thought I would try this particular mix , since it was highly revered here on Amazon . What a mistake ! Something about the formula turned me into a beast over a couple weeks . Some chemistry 's ca n't cope with certain synergistic combinations , or the synthetics used . Rainbow Light choose to use cyanocobalamin for B12 , whereas the best vitamins use methylcobalamin which is natural to the body . I stopped taking it after a couple weeks when I noticed I was intolerant and short tempered . Was back to a normal temperament almost instantly.When biochemist Lyle MacWilliam was commissioned by the Canadian Minister of Health to develop a new regulatory framework , they committed to over six years of research testing up to 1,000 multi-vitamin brands . They quickly eliminated 480 for definitive reasons . Of the 510 left , only 8 made the grade above 95 % acceptance . USANA Health Sciences Essentials ( U.S. ) was first ; Douglas Laboratories Ultra Preventive X was 2nd ; Vitamin Research Products Extended Plus ; Source Naturals Life Force Multiple ; Source Naturals Elan Vital ; USANA Health Sciences Essentials ( Canadian ) ; FreeLife Basic Mindell Plus ; Life Extension Foundation Life Extension Mix . The last one made the most sense to me after studying the synergistics . These top contenders will cost between $ 40 and $ 60 , but you do get what you pay for in this arena.This reviewed Rainbow Light product ranked only at 369th place in Dr. Lyle MacWilliam research !	-1
I think these vitamins are really doing their job , because ( and sorry if this is TMI ) when I urinate after taking these vitamins , the urine is a bright neon yellow , which means that your body has been able to absorb nutrients . The only letdown is that these vitamins do NOT give me energy like they say they do.UPDATE : I do n't know if the formula has changed or what , but with the most recent bottle I bought , each time I take these vitamins I feel EXHAUSTED within about an hour . These vitamins never did give my energy like it claims , but for them to make me exhausted now is just ridiculous . I 've tried just taking them at bedtime , but even then I feel groggy in the morning . I hate to throw out the remaining vitamins but each time I take them I 'm wiped out and I 've had enough . I will not be buying them again . And if you think it 's `` all in my head '' , read some of the other 1 and 2 star reviews that say the same thing .	-1
... after a relatively short period of time it stretched out and does n't fit well over the mattress . That being the case it 's very wrinkled and the wrinkles , under the sheet , are rather uncomfortable to sleep on .	-1
This little pillow gives great Support for the lumbar back . I use it all the time in my recliner . Plus it deflates easily and packs great to take with you on airplane or any other place you may need it for comfort . Be sure to only inflate it half way or less , if its over inflated it will be very uncomfortable . I have chronic lower back pain and have used this particular brand for a couple years . I even ordered a second one when my initial one sprung a slow leak . I do n't know what I would do without it because unlike a pillow , it actually provides better support.UPDATE : Last week my precious pillow sprung a leak around the core part and is no longer useable , i only had it a couple of months . I no longer recommend this inflatable pillow due to the short time it last . I just ordered another brand because after a week of non use my lumbar back is in extreme pain . Hopefulully the new pillow wo n't spring leaks as quickly .	-1
Have had this thing for months and overall am not pleased with it . Seems like the technology is just not there yet . Readings for the same person from day to day or hour to hour fluctuate tremendously especially on fat percentages .	-1
I purchased this pillow due to having neck pain . If you sleep on your back , this would be a good pillow . I am a side sleeper and find the pillow to be too firm and am unable to manipulate it to fit my smaller frame .	-1
I was allergic to the whey protein I ate every morning , to add more protein to my diet . The soy does n't hurt my stomach but does n't taste that good either .	-1
i am not highly allergic individual but these vitamins covered all my face with pimples . the same time bends of my elbows started to be itchy . Also never eat them with out food - the possibility to to talk to big white phone is too high ) ) ) So I stopped and switched to liquid vitamins . Now I have no reaction so far .	-1
I just had major spinal surgery and bought this to get me through while I was in the hospital.It got one star because it did work to get out the blood , iodine , etc that I was dealing with post-op . It did , technically , clean my hair . And the smell was MUCH better than the alternative.But the residue it left was horrible . There is NO way this product left my hair in any condition to 'style ' . It was as if I took a normal shower and did n't rinse out the conditioner.I was in much too fragile of a state to really buff or towel dry my hair , so maybe that was part of the problem.It was worth it to use this once to get out the grime from an accident/illness/etc , but not worth the price after that . For more than $ 5.50 PER USE , it should 've worked better . I was n't expecting miracles here , but this was really unpleasant.I can not imagine using this on a normal day like some of the posters are saying . The residue is insane , especially for $ 5.50 a pop.I would not buy this product again .	-1
Could not get adjusted to suit me . Very stressful on arms . Also , forearm fit not at all what I expected .	-1
Do n't buy this product . It is rough on the skin and will tear it up every time you shave . It came with the Merkur shaver I bought years ago and made me consider switching back to standard triple blades . Now I use Shark , which is a lot better .	-1
Size , dimensions true to description . Serves its intended purposes .. for the first 1-2 weeks . Then , I suppose like all foam-type pillows , it begins to lose its shape and support . In less than 30 days ( daily use ) the wedge lost roughly half its size / height . Essentially it compressed . I still find some use of it , though now I have to 'supplement ' its height by placing a regular pillow on top.Kind of defeats the purpose . I do n't know that a reasonably comfortable foam wedge pillow exist that will maintain its shape for a lifetime . If one exist , it 's not this one !	-1
NOT A HOOD PRODUCT , WAS N'T WHAT i EXPECTED TO LARGE BULKY AND JUST A WASTE OF MONEY FOR ME . SO ANOTHER ONE TO THROW AWAY .	-1
Amazon is really slipping lately . This item , the box was resealed as was the bag it was in , and the item had BROWN STAINS all over it . It was downright disgusting .	-1
wanted to use this for my neck/back but this was too hard for my neck and legs . its so hard finding the right product to help prop up my bed bound mom and wanted one for myself .	-1
This pillow is like resting on styrofoam . It is hard and uncomfortable . I sent this back and ordered another product that was much better .	-1
I found this to be unusable for me . It is too slippery ( even in a pillow case ) , too noisy and feels uncomfortable and smelly plastic . I will stick to a softer material . I do not recommend this . You get what you pay for .	-1
It would be comfortable if it was n't leaking . I only fill it 3/4 full per the directions but it is half full by morning .	-1
I purchased this item on March 14 , 2011 and it was shipped and delivered in a timely manner so I was please with that . I started using it a couple of days after it arrived . After using it for about a week and a half my sister started to ask me what product I was using on my skin as she said she notice I was lightening up . I did not tell her I was using Makari Oralight because I was not sure of her statement that I was lightening up that fast . I mean I just started using the dog gone thing I felt it was impossible for the results to show so quickly . Another week passed and my sister asked me again what I was using and I finally told her that I was using Makari Oralight and she wanted to use it too but I told her I only got one pack and I was going to use the whole pack and see if I saw the same results that she saw . However I notice that my ankles started swelling tremendously and I started to become concern about this . At first I thought the swelling was due to a HEREDITARY gene we have within my family but as my ankles and my legs started to become bigger I decided that I would stop taking the Makari Oralight to see if this was the cause of the swelling since I notice the swelling started a couple days after I started taking this stuff . Sure enough the Makari Oralight was the cause of my swelling ankles and legs and the tightness that I was feeling with them . To be certain that this was the cause I gave a pack to my sister and she has the same symptoms as I did along with headaches and tiredness . I decided that I did not care to continue with these pills if I was going to be affected like that . It might have been working and I say this based on one individual statement but I sure as hell did not care , for I will never jeopardize my health just for the sake of vanity and beauty .	-1
This product did not work for me ... I have dark skin and wanted a more overall even complexion . Well this did not work and no matter how much they market to darker skinned people , I do n't think it will work on dark brown skin . If it does , you may have to spend a ton of money for it to happen . I want to say that it gave my skin a dull haze and it got a little darker . That was the only difference I saw in my skin..It might work if you have caramel skin or light brown but it does not work on darker brown tones..at least it did n't for me ... .	-1
Do not buy this item . It left a terrible stain on my skin that lasted for weeks . It also eroded the skin and left a sore . I would not ever purchase again .	-1
I was very disappointed in this scale . I was hoping it would match the weight at the Weight Watcher Center where I attend classes . I loved the design and the fact that it had the partial pounds that my old scale does not . However , I never could get this scale to weigh even close to the old one and one time within four hours I had lost 11 pounds . Since that is not possible I was forced to return this scale and stick with my old one .	-1
Back in the 80 's I used this in high school and college to lose some weight . I remember it tasted great and worked so decided to order it . When I received my big can of Slim Fast I turned it around to look at the ingredients . The first ingredient is SUGAR ! Third ingredient is SUNFLOWER OIL . It still tastes yummy . However I was hungry shortly after drinking . Bummed to have wasted money on this old fashioned product .	-1

The pad gets dirty QUICK . I have hardwood floors in my home , and I used this mop to clean a tiny bedroom . The mop was overcome with dirt after I was done , and the bedroom was not that dirty . The instructions say to wash the mop with water , but that did not work well.What that means is that the mop does indeed do a good job of picking up dirt , however it is a major inconvenience that a pad has such a short usage time.The instructions also mention that you only need to use water with the mop . Water did not work as well as using a hardwood floor cleaning solution with it . If you 're looking for superior results , then do n't use water.The pad was also machine washable , so I gave that a try after I was done with the bedroom . It cleaned nicely , however the texture of the pad took a major beating , which reduced its catching power.In my opinion , if you do intend to use this to clean your home , you 're going to need about 4-5 pads which you can swap out when one becomes saturated.You could just buy a Swiffer kit and just use the disposable pads it comes with . It 's cheaper and works decently . The Swiffer allows easy switch out of pads and it is cheaper than buying pads for the MysticMop . And by the way , I was still picking up trails with the mop with a paper towel , just not as much as it would be with the Swiffer .	-1
Did not remove anymore than a & # 34 ; Shout ' would have . Disappointed.I was hoping it would work on makeup stains , it did n't .	-1
These bags are too flimsy and tear too easily . Usually Glad products are more durable , in my experience so I was disappointed .	-1
I guess I did not notice the price when I ordered these garbage bags . My bad . $ 7.79 for this product is highway robbery . Indeed I could have bought it in my local and very expensive supermarket in NYC for $ 3.99 or less . Amazon should not permit vendors to sell products with such inappropriately high prices . This practice does not fit well with Amazon 's ethos and culture .	-1
This item frequently gives blood pressure readings such as : 195 over 148 . But then if you check it with another machine on the other arm it will be a normal blood pressure . So I sent it back because of the five year warranty and they tested it and returned it unchanged and said there was nothing wrong with it.So I had to buy a different brand of machine because at least 50 % of the time or more , this one gives bad readings .	-1
I found this monitor to be way off in the readings it took when compared to those at the doctor 's office . After reading many other reviews here it seems some other people got accurate readings so I might have had a faulty unit . The battery life of this unit is good and it also stores multiple readings for your future reference.I have since tried an arm cuff unit from OmronOmron Elite 7300W Womens Avanced Blood Pressure Monitorand I find that it gives me much more accurate readings and is very easy to use . However , it is more than double the price of this monitor . I find that arm cuff monitors are generally more accurate than the wrist monitors and personally I am not going back to a wrist monitor again .	-1
after less than 6 months , this product stopped working . i received an email from amazon that the product has had problems . i 've emailed the company several times , but i 've not received any response . PASS on this product/company .	-1
I use these for a mag flashlight . I was using Duracell Quantum before and they would last 4-6 weeks before needing to be replaced . I ready two studies which showed these Rayovac batteries to last as long or longer compared to the leading brands . However , they only last a week before needing to be replaced . These batteries do not have a date and could be older units but as a this particular 18-pack , they are horrible and I would stay away from purchase .	-1
I bought these batteries a while ago as a replacement for some old no-name rechargeable batteries . I was highly dissapointed . Whereas my generic rechargeable batteries used to last a long time , these do not . The Rayovac batteries have to be constantly recharged even when used in remote controls or clocks . Cameras dry up these batteries extremely fast . I basically have to recharge the batteries every time I want to use the camera . The batteries do n't seem to charge completely . I seem to be recharging the batteries on my clock about once a month and the ones in the remote controls about once every 3 months.I do n't reccomend these batteries as they efficient nor practical as you will be recharging them over and over . Thus , you will be spending more energy than you normally would .	-1
You would n't think something so 'benign ' could irritate one 's eyes - especially when you do n't put it ANYWHERE near your eyes . I only put it on the lower half of my face , so it 's a mystery why this happens . But very shortly after I apply it , my eyes start to itch and feel 'grainy ' . I wonder if anyone else has had this experience . I 've used an olive oil product from one of the home shopping channels and never had this experience . So much for thinking that anything made in Italy is going to be great !	-1
I have fibromyalgia and I need something that delivers a heavier touch . It 's good for the reach behind your back , but it 's just not for me .	-1
Panasonic is always a good name to rely on , but this massager is just not for me . I ordered it partly because of the brand name , but mostly for that peculiar little hook , which I was hoping would dig into this one spot on the top of my shoulder , which I press into with my thumb for pain relief.Hard to tell in the picture , but this machine is really huge and too heavy and cumbersome for me to use . I have a torn rotator cuff in my right shoulder , and I normally wake up at 2 or 3 a.m. in a lot of pain . Because it is my right shoulder , I have to use the massager with my left hand , and it is really very awkward for me . Plus , that little hook does not quite fit into that painful spot on top of my shoulder . Also , it is quite noisy , although I imagine that is a situation with most of this type of product.Am ordering , instead , a smaller cordless version in another brand , and will keep on trying until I find the one that helps dispel the pain that wakes me up in the middle of the night .	-1
