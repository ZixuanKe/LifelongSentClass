good for the price .	1
Glad I made the purchase . Most TSA approved locks comes in a quantity of 2 . So glad to find these in a quantity of 4 . Worked great . Traveled great . No complaints	1
Now we lock all the pockets on our luggage and carry just one or two keys . Recommend this product for your travels .	1
Used these on a recent trip to secure luggage zippers while traveling or when leaving the bags in the hotel rooms . I know they are not & # 34 ; pick proof & # 34 ; but I felt that these locks were sufficient in deterring the casual curious.Great feature having them keyed alike .	1
I 'm really glad I purchased these ! It has been so long since I last went on a plane , I had no concept of all the new rules , but these complied perfectly . They are solid , easy to open and proved very useful when my luggage was searched . If I had n't used these TSA approved locks , they would have had to cut the locks . You get four neat locks with four keys , all of which open all the locks .	1
these are just what I wanted for my upcoming trip they fit on the suitcase zippers perfectly and they open with ease	1
I was looking for a fashion scarf in a deep blue and , monitor colors being what they are , hoped for the best when I placed this order . I was not disappointed and despite its depth the blue has a sheen in the light so that you would not mistake it for black . I 'm especially happy that it coordinates nicely with the items with which I intend to wear it . Its length , width , and weight allow it to be worn in many ways and it has a pleasantly soft crinkly texture . For its price it was a good buy and Prime shipping got it to my doorstep quickly , so I recommend it from both those perspectives .	1
I like this black pashmina as it makes me look like a Hollywood star , sort of like Johnny Depp or somebody . People look at me and wonder if I am a star or something when I wear it ( although no one has asked me for my John Hancock just yet ) .I have not gotten any ill looks or fat lips from wearing this this neck & # 34 ; doo-rag & # 34 ; and it does cut the breeze going down the front of my pirate shirts . So , that is good.I do enjoy looking like a French male model ... I have to admit .	1
This scarf is very soft and pretty . I 'm looking forward to wearing it a lot this summer . It looks nice and it feels very soft and pretty . I also love the crinklly look . It 's a bit different from my other scarves in that regard . I 'm very happy with this purchase .	1
Good quality , long scarf , looks nice , soft and comfy material . Goes along with a lot of tops . Plan on using regularly	1
Exactly what I was looking for ! Light , comfortable , 100 % cotton , looks good.Only con is that it 's $ 17 for a simple piece of fabric ... If they make some in the future with more designs than just 1 solid color that would be even better ! EDIT : I found an even better one at Dillards that is 95 % cotton , 5 % cashmere . It was priced at $ 11 . The brand is Murano . It 's thicker than this SethRoberts one . It looks like this [ ... ]	1
I would never pay full price for these shoes , but I got an amazing deal so it was well worth it . It 's obvious the quality is n't the best , there was slight chipping around the edge before I even took them out of the box . But they look exactly as pictured and I 'm happy with them for the most part .	1
I generally in between 9 & 9.5 , so I played it safe and ordered the 9.5 . They fit well and have a little room to spare in the toe area , which is perfect if I 'm wearing thicker socks . I wear them with bootcut jeans 5 days a week . They 're relatively comfortable , although some arch support would 've been nice . Very happy with purchase .	1
I was searching around for some brown combat boots , until I saw these . I seen them at macys for $ 60 but then I saw that they were $ 20 on amazon , so I decided to buy them here . One I received them I tried them on and they felt very comfortable . I am normally a size 8 so I got an 8 and they fit fine , I even got a little room left over . The zipper on the side is a big plus too ! The shipping was quick I received them in less than a week .	1
My 16 year old daughter loves them ! ! She was very impressed with my ability to pick her out such nice boots : ) .	1
I tried these cute boots on in a local department store yesterday . They fit true to size , felt comfortable and are very cute with skinny jeans tucked in . Amazon has the best price for these boots .	1
In love with my boots , they 're comfortable , expensive look , good quality and good price . They look just like any combat boots out there ... . So no complaint ! Happy with my purchase ! Looking forward to buy another pair for my 11 y/o daughter .	1
meh ... nothing fancy about them , . they are a tab small ... they fit me tightly and I do n't have large thighs . they are ok .	1
Solilor Galaxy Print Leggings fit perfectly with light wearing ease and comfort for walking , exercising , and lounging . Thanks Solilor Galaxy .	1
gorgeous clutch ! it is just the right size for evenings out to hold the essentials including my cellphone . the quality seems good too . my friends are so envious , especially at the price I got this great bag at !	1
The size is great and It is very spacious . I choose this rating because you have two options , you can wear it as a clutch bag or a shoulder bag . I love it because I love leopard print . I would recommend it to my friends .	1
This bag is not what I expected its a little big and hard like fabric is wrapped around cardboard with a little leopard accent all in all I would carry it because I bought it and do n't want to have to pay to return it . I did read the reviews and saw someone did say that it was kinda big but I said well let me see for myself and it was . I think its something that may be used for labtop or a tablet .	1
I LOVE this bag ! I saw a model on Pinterest carrying this bag and thought it was a nice bag and looked good with the outfit she had on . Imagine my surprise when I saw it on the Amazon site later that same day . The price was much lower than I would have expected a bag like this to cost and it was Amazon Prime free shipping eligible so I could not resist ordering it . It came on time and in great shape . Now that I have it I love it even more ! The texture of the animal print makes it look really high end . Great bag ! Great price !	1
I love this purse/clutch ! At first when I ordered this product I thought it was a normal size clutch , should of check the measurements of it . When I received it I was shocked that it was so big , as soon as my friend saw it she loved it ! I really like it and the price for what is being sold is amazing . For sure this purse would be over $ 20 at a store at the mall .	1
I was looking for a sturdy slipper that had some style to it for Christmas Eve at a relative 's house , and this fit the bill ! It 's warm , comfortable , and wo n't be falling apart any time soon . This is great , and I love the sparkle threads !	1
I needed a nice pair of slippers for my daughter who always goes barefoot around the house . I asked her size and ordered exactly what she said . At first , the shoes seemed a little small but once she put on a thin sock , they fit perfectly . A soft inner sole makes them very comfortable and they are nice enough that sometimes she wears them for a quick trip to the store with her jeans . Go figure !	1
I am quite pleased with these slippers . The are comfy and keep my feet warm . With the sturdy sole , I can even wear them outside for walks .	1
I bought these as a gift for my mother . She loves them . I tried them on myself and they are toasty and have a little cushion between foot and ground . They kept my foot pretty warm . My mother has worn them daily since she got them . She likes wearing slippers and keeps them on in the house and can even walk outside to let the dog out in the yard without having to change into shoes . She wears them so much that last week she forgot she had them on and wore the to the store .	1
So cute . Polkadot sections are a cotton fabric similar to bed sheets . I expected silky . Still very cute and worth the purchase . Bow does n't detach from belt . You either wear the sash/belt and bow or nothing at all . Cute either way . Got tons of compliments . I would purchase this again .	1
This product was exactly as described . Perfect fit for the hourglass figure . I measured myself at 27 inch waist 37 inch hip and size 8 couldnt have fit more perfectly . This skirt is on the thinner side as far as fabric but it is perfectly comfortable and a great summer outfit . i love it absolutely worth the great price .	1
The fit is very nice , it fits as expected , the material is nice , the quality is nice , I do recommend	1
My son is n't able to tie a shoe , but as kids get older it is harder and harder to find nice looking Velcro shoes . He needed athletic shoes for gym and needed to put them on independently . I replaced the original laces with these ... voila ! He is very happy and so am I !	1
I just had hip replacement surgery , and I wo n't be able to reach down to tie shoelaces for a few months , so I wanted to turn my lace-up sneakers into slip-ons . These work great . I bought them in red , orange , yellow and tan . They are 45 inches long , so they do n't skimp on length . I like them very much .	1
This is a very good product . Once the shoes are laced and tied you 'll rarely re-tie again . It would be great if you made a shorter length for kids tennis .	1
I bought these before and I will buy them again and recommend them to others !	1
62 y.o ... .not as limber as I used to be . Bit of a belly . Hated bending over and tying laces . I 'm retired . Casual clothes everyday . Converse low tops & low top jogging shoes . Bought a pair of these laces for both pair of shoes . I LOVE IT ! ! ! ! Laced them up to the proper tightness , tied a bow tie and there you have it ... SLIP ON SHOES . The medium size fit perfectly on my size 11 low tops . I am one happy dude ! ! !	1
I was looking for elastic laces that did not require a lock , and thought that I would try these . I bought the size called Kids 4 - Adult 9 to use with my walking shoes . They are the perfect length ( 30 inches ) , and the hot pink color adds a bit of whimsy to boring old plain white shoes . Because they are flat they tie easily and look good on the shoe - much better than laces that are round and slippery.I like them so much that I am buying two more pair - teal and red .	1
Best idea for shoe laces . They should be standard on all lace up tennis shoes , and have the cotton or nylon type as the spares when you buy shoes ! I bought them for my grandchildren , to help wuth learning to tie their own shoes . And to make it easier on their parent getting them out the door on time for school .	1
These fit great and being tall , the longer length is great . Will be ordering more soon to wear with my summer/spring outfits .	1
I love long tank tops/spaghetti strap shirts and they 're very difficult to find in stores . I bought these on a whim in hopes that they would magically fit me and they did ! They are very comfortable and the perfect length . The price was pretty decent as well .	1
This tank is n't very expensive -- the material is a bit on the thin side . it does have a nice stretch to it though.However , it is long , as advertised ! ( Great for me as I have a long torso ) .The straps are adjustable as well , which is very helpful.Overall , 5 stars for being as advertised and a great price .	1
They are true to size , the colors are wonderfull , I just wish they had this top in white , they are long so if you want it for layering than this is the top for that , they are opague except the light colors , so you can where the darker colors alone .	1
I bought this T-shirt because I love this color blue . Light colors are always hard to find there was some kind of sale but I did n't understand it .	1
It came faster as I was expecting . I stand 5'1 & # 34 ; and weighs 105 lbs . I ordered medium and fits me well . I love the color pink .	1
I wear camisoles every single day and have been wearing Zenana 's for a few years now . They are the most affordable I have been able to find and I love the length . I always buy camisoles without the built in bra , and wear my own bra as I find it more comfortable . I love my camisoles to be a little longer and these are perfect ! I am a little embarrassed to admit that I have our forty of these hanging in my closet and I keep them color coordinated . They are nice enough that you can wear them alone in hot weather , and are still perfect for layering . I have found that when you keep a large amount of camisoles they last so much longer as you rotate them out more often .	1
My daughter and I wear tank/cami 's under everything we wear . I do like the length very much ! It fits as expected .	1
Post C-Section Body Woes -- this tank is a life saver ! I finally feel good about myself again , all thanks to layering with these longer tanks . Helps cover my chest and tummy and butt !	1
Im going to buy these in every color once I get more money . Quality fabric and very long . I wore these while pregnant and can still wear them now since they do n't stretch out .	1
I purchased this tank in white and it 's great for an undershirt -- especially if you 're looking for something a bit longer . I 'm 5'2 & # 34 ; and this covers my bum quite nicely . I did n't have any issues with riding up during the day and it 's very comfy . My one complaint is that it is pretty sheer and you will probably never want to wear this without another shirt over top of it . But for the price -- it 's a lovely undershirt . I 'll buy more !	1
these tank tops are awesome . the long length is great . they arrived super fast and are super soft . i layer every day and these tank tops do n't bunch or ride up i will be buying more	1
This product arrived today and was exactly what I wanted . The fit is good , the colors are as shown , and the length is great . I am 5'7 and 140 lbs and ordered a medium . I like that it does not have a built in bra because those never work and just add bulk . Material is soft and light weight .	1
I reluctantly returned these lovely pants as they have a dropped waist and , as a senior , our shapes did n't work well together .	1
I was wearing the Dockers version of the metro trouser pants , and found these . I like them because you can dress them up or down and they especially work well for me for work . The price was fantastic which is what made me try these . Move over Dockers ! I will say that I bought these in another color too , but they did n't fit the way these did . When I took a closer look , I noticed that the cotton vs spandex material was different . I was VERY unhappy at the way the other ones fit ( http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BHRGMCK/ref=oh_details_o02_s01_i00 ? ie=UTF8 & psc=1 ) and plan on returning them . The cut was very different - very baggy ... Buy again , will go back to this exact one and look at the material content and purchase the same one in different colors .	1
this are my first lee pants in steel shine & black shine , kinda hesitant to what size I would order , so to play safe , I ordered a size 8 and asize 10 . . if one does n't fit I could keepthe other pair . . when it arrived , the size 8is just perfect for me and the size 10 still ok , just an inch or maybe less difference . .anyway , I 'm happy with my orders , I didn'tmake a mistake with them . . btw , I 'm 5'2 , hip size is 39 , I did n't touch the length , itis perfect ! . . Thanks , Lee and more power ! : D	1
Very comfortable . I 'm 5'3 & # 34 ; and 130lbs . This fit really well -- not tight at all . It was very comfortable . The only reason I returned it was it had a tear at the waist . Will order again once they get royal blue in stock .	1
i like the fit as well as the shimmer of the leggings and the high waist is nice for anti-muffin top ! : )	1
I really like these leggings . They are bright and shinny . I 'm a size 12 and they fit though they were tight , but not uncomfortable .	1
Smells nasty . I 'll wash it and live.I 'm about 5'6 and 105 lbs . I normally wear a size 1 . These fit great , snug and sexy . I 'd say they 're stretchy enough to fit someone up to 135 lbs , at least . But if you 're small and hesitant to buy a one size fits all product , do n't fear ! This one will fit you.I bought these pants in black . The material is thick enough that the pants are not see through ( yay ! ) , and the material is good , so you do n't need to worry about snagging it easily on something .	1
These leggings are well made , fit as expected and I would recommend them to anyone looking for this kind of product .	1
I absolutely love the handbag ! I would purchase again and highly recommend it to others ! The bag arrived very quickly and that was a plus as well .	1
I bought these shoes because I do n't have any cute flats but I am having knee surgery next week and did n't want to be stuck in just sneakers for months . These shoes are very comfortable . They stretch a little bit so it you are between sizes go with the smaller one.At first I got a faulty pair . But I contacted the seller and they offered to send me another non faulty pair with no problems . These guys have AMAZING customer service . If they are ever selling another product that I want I will be buying it from them	1
These shoes were really made well for the low price . I love the navy crochet and they are definitely a plus for a great casual look .	1
This is a great shoe . It does n't have a lot of structural support , but if you 're okay with that , and like the feeling of being barefooted , these are the shoes for you ! Buy these , not Toms . They say that for every pair of shoes you buy , they donate a pair to a child in need . In actuality , you 're paying for the `` donation '' which is fine , it 's an easy way to `` donate . '' But , if you buy these shoes , you can also buy a pair to donate and still have money left over ! Do n't let the big corporation pull the `` shoes '' over your eyes by pretending that they , in any way , are a `` green '' company . You can be a `` green '' all by yourself !	1
Very cute but runs small and the sole not very impressive . Cute shoe tho.I think I will give them to someone with one size smaller shoe .	1
This ring is beautiful , everyone thinks its sver classy . Its not overpowering shine . I would recommend theis Ring to all my relatives , guys she would never tell the difference . I should have bought two set.I always get my Jewelery from Amazon , because there styles are awesome and you can n't beat the price . The Custemer Service Dept is very quick and very helpful	1
So far had the ring about a month it 's still shinning has not changed color or turned my finger green I bet plenty of compliments on this ring I always tell them I paid 8 bucks and they really get shocked they always say its a nice ring	1
these are beautiful , just what I wanted , a cheap , fake , but pretty set of rings to wear when I need to , and if I loose them then im not out much . they have not turned my finger green at all , and I have worn them ALOT . the stones are all still in place and shiny , and the silver is still shiny and looks new and real as well.I recommend these because for the value you cant get anything better , everything else looks cheap and fake , trust me I have tried others , and people think these are real ! they fit perfect and are true to size as well .	1
I love it , I ordered for my friend , is simple , looks really nice , do not look extreme fake , stone sparkle , just beautiful , l will order one for myself	1
The ring set is very pretty , not too big or small . It looks very nice on , has alot of sparkle , and even has the different color when the light and sun hit it , just like a real diamond does . Have gotten alot of compliments on the set . It has n't dulled or tarnished . It cane very quickly wraped secure . Will definitely buy from FASHION PLAZA again .	1
Just received my ring today ( 2 weeks ahead of time ) and it is beautiful ! Times are tough and I wanted something as a place holder until we can afford the ring I want . This one is perfect , you would n't be able to tell it is n't real unless you were told . Definitely recommend ! !	1
These rings look so much more expensive than they are . I receive compliments every time I wear them.The diamond fell out of my original engagement ring , and I wanted a replacement without spending a lot of money . These rings were perfect . I have only been wearing them for a couple of weeks , but they still look great .	1
I REALLY LIKED THE RING SET , IT WAS A GREAT SURPRISE TO MY WIFE , SHE ALMOST CRIED WHEN I GAVE IT TO HER A AN EARLIER GIFT .	1
These rings are very lovely and yes , they do look much more expensive than the price . Also , they arrived well before the month+ shipping ETA , about a week from ordering which is phenomenal since they were shipped from China . I would give them 5 stars , except I wear a size 8 ring even on the water-logged days . These are very tight on my ring finger . I held them up against my size 8 's and these that I received are more like 7 to 7.5 . So they run small and worth keeping in mind since they are obviously mass-produced , and thus I take 1/2 star for that . I like them well enough , though , I 'm going to order them again in a size 9 ( even though the price jumped a bit from the previous order but still very reasonable ) to be able to wear comfortably and I will have the ones I have now to wear on my skinnier finger days ( smiles ) . The other 1/2 star goes to the color of the bands , they are more yellow gold than rose gold but still very lovely .	1
I am very pleased with the look considering the low price paid for the item . I 've noticed that quite a bit of the reviews said these rings run small ; I find they run big so you will have to decide for yourself . The Seller is very accommodating about exchanges . I liked the Seller and the rings so much , I made more purchases from them so I can have matching accessories . Two thumbs up .	1
I wear this set everyday . I get so many compliments . I love the rose gold color . It is comfortable to wear .	1
Despite what past reviewers said , these boots were too big for me when I ordered a half size up . Better to stick to your usual size . They are very cute and seem to be good quality for the price .	1
Cute and I 've received a lot of compliments . They look great with skinny jeans . I would buy these shoes again .	1
Cute boot . But had to return because they were too small . Usually take an 8 , ordered 8-1/2 but still too small . Returned for a size 9 .	1
I purchased these for my 12-year-old daughter . She loves them and gets compliments on them whenever she wears them . She says they 're comfortable . They 've held up very well even though she 's worn them while there was snow and salt on the ground . We both recommend them .	1
Brought this this past fall and I have worn them t death . they are so comfy an stylish . Arrived quick and for the money you just cant beat the deal .	1
These shoes are great I loved them so much that im trying to pair more and more outfits together so I have to wear them . will buy more maybe defferent colors .	1
I bought the Taupe color and they look exactly like they do in the pictures . The shoes fit about right , and with the strings you can adjust them to be a little more snug if you want . The strings are cheap , but that is expected with these . So do n't pull too hard or you will snap/break them . Buy yourself a more durable pair somewhere for a cheap price and they 'll do a little better.They 're nice shoes to wear on little occasions , but not for every day use . You get what you pay for , so these are n't going to be long lasting due to the quality if you do decide to wear them every day . If you want them to go far , be easy on them ( such as not getting them real wet , keeping them clean , etc . ) I do like the shoes , though . They seem comfortable , and they look real cute with a pair of jeans , maybe even shorts or a skirt ( depending on how you 're dressing ) . For the price , they 're not as bad as some people say they are .	1
I ordered a size 7 , and though they fit just fine , I would 've liked a bit more room.Also , it does n't look like the best quality.Other than that , I really like these shoes ; they 're comfortable and several people have complemented me for them.Update : They look so worn out , as if I 've been using them non-stop for years and not for a few months.Definitely not for everyday use .	1
Ordered these in black for my tween aged daugter . She loves them.Material is a bit on the thinner side -- but for the price the works.Bootie looks great with skinny jeans , skirts and dresses.Will order another style or two from this brand as the color my daughter want 's returns to stock.Thanks !	1
just the right size that i need look just like the picture price is great just great what more can you ask for	1
My wife wanted three initial pendants -- one for each of our children . I purchased 5 -- so that the whole family would be represented . These pendants are just the right size for stacking them . I did buy a different chain -- one which was a little sturdier without being too big for the pendants . Bottom line -- she loves them .	1
Nice quality . Was bought as a gift and I was very pleased at the sight of it . Nice sturdy chain to compliment the pendant . Would recommend to anyone looking to buy a nice gift at a great price .	1
Much nicer than I expected . I purchased it for my daughter whose initial is M for mother 's day.I think it is very good value for the money and looks more expensive than it was .	1
I ordered eight of these as stocking stuffer gifts for office staff , and they are darling ! the letters are a high polish silver , block letter styling with a solid finished reverse side . They are classic enough to suit all tastes , and you simply can not beat the price for the quality of the product .	1
Do n't know how else to describe this pretty , pretty necklace . I needed a shorter necklace to wear with an outfit which had boat-style neckline . This necklace can be worn either as a 16 '' or an 18 '' . It was so pretty - much prettier than the picture . The crystals in the curved bar are not raised , so they do n't catch on even the sheerest of fabrics , and the crystals almost looked crushed together - no individual settings - yet the way the manufacture designed the setting is ingenious and elegant-looking . This is such a pretty necklace , and the fact that it 's sterling silver make it a no brainer !	1
I gave it a 4 because it looks fake/weird when its upclose and I also needed to order another one and return the last one i had bc a stone was missing . Looks weird bc the stones are glued randomly ( not neatly ) to the white background.Overall , looks so great from a far and ppl are always complimenting it . Looks great in photos . Just dont look TOOOO close ; )	1
My 4 year old loves this costume , and it looks great . I will say that it is very long on my 4 year old . But good costume .	1
Love this costume~ ! ! ! My grandson looks like muscle Iron Man . Tt is well made and think it last a while from Halloween to playing the part daily afterwards . Would recommend this costume . Grandson loves it ... just hard to keep it from him until Halloween , but we made it.HAPPY HALLOWEEN ! ! !	1
My grandson loved this Halloween costume . He wears it to play in too . He 's 6 yrs . old and this fit perfect . He 's a bit on the small size .	1
I 'm so glad I purchased this when I did because the very next day the price went up ! So I got a gorgeous bag at a great price and I feel like I won a prize !	1
sturdy , colorful , flirty , flattering . everywhere i take this bag i get plenty of compliments . the bag is also very sturdy . the material and zipper are a cut above . i know this bag will last . it compliments many shoes and outfits i have . i just love it .	1
Received for Christmas as a gift , I got this purse in the blue/black color . I had seen a similar design in just the blue from a high-end maker , but could n't justify spending big bucks so I walked away . Much to my delight this bag is very similar and about ninety percent less than the other bag ! The picture offers a true representation of the item , but I think it 's even better in person . The hardware adds a nice bit of flair , and the way the colors blend under the patent finish is both classy and fun.If I have anything negative to say it 's that it 's very , very stiff . While that 's great for having the bag hold it 's shape , it 's not conducive to easy opening and use . I hope it time , with use , the bag will soften a bit without any cracking or wrinkling appearing . I will update the review when and if this happens.Overall , a very nice bag and well made . I 'm very pleased with my gift and at round forty bucks , I 'm thinking I may need to buy another one in a different color very soon . I 've already received several compliments by women friends who all think it must be from a much more expensive brand .	1
Ladies ... .if you have wondered if the photo does this purse justice ... .it does . The color fades beautifully from rich to light , and it is that glossy glossy shine of patent . My husband , of 34 years commented on this bag . Granted , he compared the color to that of a vintage Ford Fairlane , but that was his way of complimenting the purse 's & # 34 ; paint job. & # 34 ; He has NEVER commented on a purse , and the compliments did n't stop with him . I had to put it away for our cold Wisconsin winter , now approaching , and look forward to getting it out this spring . Only small complaint is that I find the opening a little tight . Recently discovered there is , in fact , a key well hidden in the dangle . Do n't know why it mattered other than I collect vintage bags .	1
I love this purse . Great purple color . Stands up . Is shiny . Makes me smile . Great size for me . It almost has a life of its own . Very pleased .	1
This is a darling purse . It was a little stiff at first but has relaxed . The shading of the green is very nice . I 've used it twice and had multiple compliments !	1
I love this purse , but I do wish the opening was a little bigger . Overall , it is just the right size .	1
It was a nice bag . It 's like fake jewelry , my not be for everybody but I liked and hope my girls will .	1
From the picture it looks like the purple is a berry color , but when I received it , it was a dark purple . Even though the color was not what I expected , it is a very beautiful handbag and very roomy . I love it .	1
Scarleton Patent Satchel H116707 - Blue This Bag for me was a MUST HAVE , Looks Better than the picture and Quality ... THANK YOU ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
Ladies this is a must have item when I carry this purse I get a lot of compliments..	1
I had been looking for this shade of blue to wear under some shirts I had purchased .I am very pleased with the quality and fit .	1
This was a nice addition to my wardrobe and the price was right . Matched exactly the color I needed for a particular shirt .	1
What we ordered is what we expected . Thank you . It is a relief to get exactly the product that one ordered considering that we are overseas and it usually takes about a month before we actually have the product in hand .	1
I like the vibrant colors of these tank tops . I also like the fact that the lace is on both the top and bottom . These are extra long ; which works perfect for my daughter who has a long waist . I am sure she will get a lot of use out of these tank tops .	1
Fits well , comfortable feel . ILove that it is a long tank and can be worn over the top of pants for a layered look .	1
I bought this cami to wear on my yearly vacation with jeans and a pair of aquamarine stud earrings : PERFECT ! ! ! The baby blue is exactly as pictured . I 'll be back for other colors .	1
I NOW HAVE ABOUT 10 OF THESE ZENANA TANK TOPS . THEY ARE AWESOME AND FIT SO PERFECT . I LOVE THE LONGER LENGTH AND THE COLORS ARE AMAZING . I CAN DOUBLE THEM UP WITH OTHER TANK TOPS OR WEAR THEM ALONE WITH MATCHING BANDEAUS . SO MANY WAYS TO WEAR THEM AND THE LACE TRIM IS SO PRETTY .	1
I am a Cami or Tank Top wearer ... These two are pretty but are not worn as much as most of mine because I do n't have as many things that match ... possibly as summer approaches they will be worn more as well . Nice quality and good fit .	1
I bought these to wear under those necklines that plunge too much . They are beautiful and work great . They also fit good too . They are just snug enough to be comfortable and stay in place . They are a little longer than a lot of the tops , but I like them a little longer , so they do n't roll or pull up as much . I recommend them .	1
I bought several colors and they look even better close up . The lace is pretty at the bottom and not cheesy looking at all . The length of these are great because they are long ( but not to the knees long ) and stay put after sitting , bending and etc . They are not thin and cheap like some other camisoles I have bought . The colors are truly amazing ! ! ! The avocado , mustard and fuchsia are total winners ! These are perfect for layering . Order more than one and the price per shirt total goes down . One shirt shipped to you is 5.65 for shipping , 5 shirts shipped to you is 6.30 . So for $ 0.75 more you can get 4 more shirts shipped to you . Totally worth getting 5 of them ( or more ) !	1
Liked the camisole . Helps to keep me warm under shirts and sweaters . I wish it were not quite so long , but overall , I am happy with my purchase .	1
This lace trim tank top is wonderfully comfy . The reason I gave it one star is because it is too long . I am 5'4 & # 34 ; and it reaches down pass my hips . I think these are meant for a taller model . But the colors are pretty and as mentioned , comfortable and also soft .	1
If you intend to wear this as a tank top ( shirt ) ONLY , you should expect this item to run small . I purchased 2-packs totalling to 4 and I wear them as a camisol . Therefore my size rating would be FIT AS EXPECTED . They are very soft and made well .	1
I love how long this tank is . It great to wear under everything or by its self . It a most have for every that love the layered look !	1
Just love them , they fit under everything and are great just on their own ... they fit wonderful and the material is very nice and soft .	1
These are great for wearing under your shirts- The was well and fit niceHowever , they run big so I would recommend going smaller .	1
The blue is a gorgeous color and the cut of the dress is divine ! The fabric is very soft and cool , but also THIN . Careful about undies . It is not see-through in a darker color , but WPL might be an issue .	1
It is very comfortable and light , great for the summer . I do think it could use a belt where the elastic is around the waist/empire area .	1
This dress has good quality and fit . It magically makes you look thinner , I was impressed ! It 's also comfortable , so it 's a double win .	1
I love this dress it fits great . The color is nice too . Looks better in person . I would definitely order another one in a different color .	1
This dress could go with anything . Add a belt , a jacket , a vest , an underskirt , leggings , etc . You can make it what you want . Plus , it 's extremely comfortable . The only downside is that the fabric is a bit thinner than expected so you have to be careful of that depending on what areas you fill the dress out in more .	1
This dress is amazing ! Soft and comfortable as well as stylish ! I wore it on a date paired with a jeweled belt , knee high brown riding boots and a cropped denim jacket ... perfection !	1
This is a really nice dress . Very soft and really hugs the curves . I may order more colors . Do recommend this one .	1
These paints fit great , I get a lot of complements when I wear them . They do n't pinch or bind . I will buy more .	1
I did n't notice those 4 words in the description , but I like them anyway since they stretch . I 'd prefer they come to the waist .	1
These fit well - snug but not skin tight - thus looking slimming and nice - but still ok to where to work.My daughter and I are getting some in several colors.One downside ( and the reason for the 4 stars ) these jeans have a distinct chemical smell to them - even after washing - I 'm hoping the smell will fade with time .	1
I was looking for a ring that could look really cool without emptying my wallet , and I love this one : ) although the bottom ring is a little tight on my finger , i can definitely deal with it because it looks really awesome . I love the pointed part on the end that resembles a long finger nail . I recommend this super cool ring ^_^ n	1
I had ordered this previously and it arrived broken . However it was very easy to get a replacement and now I 'm in love with it . This is my new favorite piece of jewelry and I get compliments on it all the time .	1
It 's not adjustable . Or it 's just incredibly hard to adjust . Either I 'm doing it wrong or mine is being stubborn , it wo n't widen to fit my finger and that 's disappointing . I guess you need to have really thin fingers to wear these , unfortunately . That said , I still love it and will keep it . Mine did n't arrive broken and came rather faster in the mail than I would have guessed given the ETA from China . Exceptionally put together and very professional . Well worth the price if you like these kinds of rings .	1
Not really into the whole Gothic thing but I love this ring . Fits great and is worth the price . It is not adjustable or anything so make sure you get the right size for you .	1
This came faster than I expected . It was wrapped in a good amount of bubble wrap in the package , and not damaged at all . There were no cracks/scratches or chips . A lot of the reviews state that it arrived broken , mine was n't , it was perfect , maybe I was lucky ? The ring honestly does n't feel that cheap , it looks nice and unique and is a low cost alternative to those Vivienne Westwood armor rings . It 's surprisingly lightweight while holding it or being worn . It 's a tad too small for my index finger , but is nearly perfect on the middle finger . Keep in mind my hands are n't huge , not tiny but thin I guess . I 'm not worried about it getting broken , since it 's not going to be worn out and about and in extreme situations . Overall , I think this is a great deal for the price , and I 'd definitely recommend it .	1
Do n't let anyone tell you that this ring is fragile . After going at it with pliers adjusting a few times , it still held up perfectly and adjusted pretty easily considering how sturdy it is . I adjusted it just fine to fit on my ring finger then decided to go a bit more and wear it on my middle finger . Lovely . Giving someone the bird has never been more satisfying . It also got here way early !	1
This ring is a punk rock , metal-esque , macabre beauty . I love it , 100 % . This ring will fit fingers between sizes 6 to probably about 9 , any smaller or bigger and you 're probably going to have issues . The only reason this ring did not get 5 stars is because i had to do some work on the interlocking pieces of the ring . I had to tighten them ( which can be done with a pair of pliers ) because the middle piece kept coming apart from the rest of the ring . After that small adjustment was made , I 've had no problems ( :	1
I get so many comments on this thing . If you like unusual jewelry then get in . I wear on my pointer finger because you ca n't really bend this easily . It does n't pinch and it 's not heavy . I like it .	1
I like itNot the best , but good quality for the price . It has n't turned my finger green so that 's a plus .Over all it 's a nice product .	1
I use these shoes for work and they allow me to be comfortable and appropriate at the same time . You can almost forget that you have your shoes on .	1
I purchased this shoe for working in . They were non-slip and skid resistant which was a requirement for the shoe I needed for work . They fit like they were made for my foot . They felt very comfortable for all the walking I have to do on my job in the bakery of a grocery store . They felt great since the 1st day I wore them . I liked them so much I purchased a 2nd pair for work so that I would not wear one pair out too quickly . I would recommend them to anyone who need a good looking , comfortable work shoe for their job .	1
Very cute and stylish ! Chain is long enough to wear as a cross body bag . Quality is definitely cheap but for less than $ 7 I will not be complaining . Received purse way earlier than expected . I purchased this in the vibrant green and it arrived as pictured .	1
Super cute . shipment was fast .	1
I just got this purse in today ! Its really cute , but it is definitely red , not peach . Also , the chain seems pretty cheap and looks like it will break easily . I gave this 4 stars because I also received an extra purse , so that is great !	1
its exactly like a big enevlope . came way better expected . only reason it wont get 5 stars is because the threading is visible on the black one . so it kinda looks cheap but doesnt . but nothing black nail polish of marker cant fix	1
This is a very cute clutch bag . It & # 8217 ; s not very expensive , and it serves its purpose . I do however have two complaints : 1 . ) The awful painted leather smell . 2 . ) The orange coloring on outside edges . I think this clutch would look better if it was 100 % beige all over .	1
For my daughter 's 12th birthday ( going on 16 ) I thought a more mature-looking purse would get her excited . I was totally right and she loves this thing . It 's a little glossy , has a compact form , and can be used with or without the chain . The chain seems kinda chintz so do n't expect much there . But given the price and the color choices I 'd say this clutch/purse is a bargain . Just do n't expect fast shipping ...	1
I got this within 2wks of ordering . I was very surprised to have gotten it so quick . I really like this clutch alot . I cannt use it as a clutch or crossbody . Super cute	1
Cool way to have a cut off shirt and its comfy too . Feels really nice with the cotton doubled to make a hoodie effect .	1
I bough a U.S Medium im 5.8ft and 170lb The fits alittle tight but it shows off my physique nicely , those of you whocant pull off tight clothing should stray away because I ate a lot n it was noticeable through the shirt ,	1
Excellent product ... let 's me show off my guns and it has a hood ; perfect ! I 'm 5 ' 8 & # 34 ; , 150 lbs , muscular , small fits me perfectly !	1
Originally I got the wrong color , which had nothing to do with this seller . It was a warehouse issue as I had it grouped up with another item that came from Amazon themselves . I sent a message to amazon and they 're sending me a new one . My hubby loves these types of shirts . It is true to size . If your want a medium order the Asia ( L ) . Will be ordering again .	1
I live in the So . Cal . desert area and this shirt has been very handy . Nice looking and very versatile for the extremes of hot days and cool nights that occur in the fall-winter .	1
I chose this item to work out during the Autumn and Spring time ; and kept myself warm ! But it looks so unique in this bright orange color that I am wearing it as my daily garment ! It is easy to wear and it keeps you really cool ! This garment is made of cotton . Excellent choice ! Two thumbs up ! ! !	1
I got this to wear under my workout shirts , to provide a little more warmth when exercising in the early morning and while it does the job , the sleeve holes are a bit small and tend to rub my arm-pits , so I ended up cutting them out a bit . I 'm 5'11 & # 34 ; @ 195 lbs . and the shirt fits snuggly .	1
This bra supports the upper breast as well as the bottom part and it keeps them separate . The best thing about bras with the high clasp in back is that I can bend all the way forward , pick things up , and not need to reposition the girls . : ) I can run down stairs without needing to cross my arms . The price is quite reasonable as well . I just want more colors in my size now ( 32DDD )	1
Love these socks , they are very cute and the quality is great but if you have thick legs they will be very very tight .	1
I just got this today ( 9-7-2013 ) & my Wife loves it . There Very soft & they look cute on her . She 's happy & that 's what matters ; )	1
These socks fit just fine , and they have Soft kitty on them from the Big Bang Theory . Well made , and fit as expected . If your a Big Bang fan , you need to own a pair of these socks . : )	1
These were a gift and were extremely well received . They are made of quality material and hold up very well in the wash Definitely recommend .	1
The headband is pretty but is not going to lie against the head as shown unless I can find a way to shape it . It sticks straight up . Delivery took about 2 weeks .	1
Soooo beautiful and made so well . Just right for the little doll when she gets here In July . This is just gorgeous ! the color is outstanding ! ! ! ! !	1
Adorable little headband for ages 3 months to 4 years depending on head circumference . Its very beautiful and stretches real well . Love it !	1
I bought this headband for my goddaughter because she needed one and I was look for one and saw this one and fell in live with it . One thing I can tell you is that it looks better and cutier when you get it	1
I used this as a top piece decoration for a 5 tier diaper cake and it looked amazing ! Great as a usable decoration , just use it as a decoration then & # 34 ; Mommy & # 34 ; can use it as it is originally intended for..a unique hairband . This item arrived in good , unused condition as described . I do think you may want to use a small bobby pin for added support since it is a little heavy for a wee one , it will depend on thickness of hair . I would buy again .	1
Adorable on ! Looking at it in the package I was skeptical ! But it ; s great ! Looks smashing and even had her 3 months pictures taken with it on ! NOT for everyday wearing !	1
Great complimentary birthday , baby shower , Christmas , any occasion present . They are beautiful , and are not just a cheap knockoff , they are durable and , well just splendid .	1
My niece is having a girl so I started buying different hair stuff . This is just adorable and I can not wait to see this on our new little great niece whose due in September !	1
It did take awhile to get here ( 3weeks or so ) but the item is beautiful and of quality . The price was great-I would have paid a bit more even .	1
I ca n't say enough about this piece so beautiful , I am happy I purchased this . It was shipped from China , not everything is bad coming from there just do n't order any crocheting jobs .	1
Adorable little headband for ages 3 months to 4 years . Love the colors and it stretches really well . love it : )	1
I purchase the baby red feather headband as a gift , its so adorable and different from other headbands . Color and beauty of this headband was even prettier in hand ! Very Happy with the purchase and received it fairly fast . Will do business with you again . Thank you so much .	1
This is a very pretty and comfortable headband . I wish that it was more durable so that I could wear it more often .	1
Good Item . Looks very nice & people give positive compliments when they see it . I would recommend it . Delivery was good .	1
For the price it is perfect . The headband is a good fit for my two year old . My only problem is how straight it is , but that 's easily fixed by putting it in a coffee cup .	1
I ordered this because the price was so low and it was so cute . It was shipped from China but great looking and awesome textures for photography !	1
I like the infinity symbol and I saw these and decided to try them . They are very pretty . The diamonds , obviously are fake but are very shiny and stand out . They are a great size , not too big but not too small . Not cheap which is what I was expecting . I do not wear them all the time but quite a bit and I 've had no problems with tarnishing . I 'm actually thinking about buying the matching necklace . I would recommend these .	1
They 're not my style . I got them for presents and I just can say that they look really delicate and well made . Definitely a good buy .	1
Love these ! I wear them all the time and they match a necklace i ordered a while ago . i wanted something small to fit my second ear piercing and they arent cheap . they are good quality . They dont change color . So dont worry .	1
I love these earring so much I have ordered 2 pairs and I am planning on ordering a couple more for family .	1
these are very cute normally I would have ordered the sterling silver however they do hold up very well as fashion jewelry and you do get two pairs mine came with one pair initially in a cubic zirconia missing out of the pair that I got the sellers they immediately replaced both pairs with out me returning anything to them they have great customer service Ashawhich is it for them I 'd give 5 stars	1
I very much liked the pajamas , except they are a bit too large and the flower pattern a bit too busy . The next time I order from that company , I will keep in mind that the large size is really & # 34 ; large & # 34 ; .	1
These pajamas are soft and comfortable . I 'm 5'8 & # 34 ; and they are nice and long . It 's hard to find PJs long enough for me . I only wish they had a pocket somewhere . No place for a tissue .	1
Was a gift for my mother . She loved them . Bought small instead of medium . Runs really big . Looked for a long time for long sleeve summer pajamas . Good price .	1
This is a pretty pattern and seems nicely put together but the product was advertised as & # 34 ; small & # 34 ; when it is actually labeled & # 34 ; small long & # 34 ; ..and it is long in the arms and legs . Disappointing but it had to be worn to find out it was too long and the package from the company has a specific message that returns can be made only in the original package and NEVER WORN . Not possible ... so we keep it . Not happy with the misrepresentation .	1
Purchased for my daughter in college . They are cotton and very soft . Perfect for sleeping and lounging around . Easy care , which is important when you are a college student .	1
Good quality cotton , long trousers ( good for me ) and roomy -- as PJs should be ! I will try these again , and soon .	1
Gotten lots of compliments & # 8230 ; I 'm at that age where I ca n't wear synthetics anymore due to sweating issues . These are perfect and so comfortable and adorable . I 'm in my pajamas a lot and people have complimented me . They fit true to size and are a great buy . Thank you .	1
Great jams . They are a little larger and longer than a normal size but I do n't care . Well made . The colors are bright and true to photo . Washes well .	1
I bought these with the intention of wearing it after I deliver my baby in the hospital , so that I can have an open-front top but look decent for visitors . The fabric is lightweight , but not cheap , so I know I wo n't be sweaty in it . The pattern is gorgeous and the waistband is drawstring so you can adjust it for your own comfort . The pants are a little long ( I 'm 5'4 & # 34 ; ) , but I do n't mind because it 's pajamas so it can have a more casual look , or it 's easy to roll up if you want . I would definitely recommend !	1
These are great . Really pretty and soft . Great quality for pajamas . Great to wear all day ... ..I love to sit around early evening in pretty pajamas	1
They fit even better than expected . I usually have to order tops in size 1X . So I was concerned that the XL might not be large enough . But the cut is ample and , consequently , very comfortable . I need to get the pants hemmed as they are too long which is not unusual . Love the pattern in the fabric as well as the weight of the cotton . Very pleased with this item .	1
These are wonderful PJs . I wanted something light for summer and comfortable to sleep in , not binding or tight . They fit the bill . They are also great to lounge around in the evening , snuggled up on the couch reading a book or watching a good movie . You 'll love these pajamas !	1
This was a gift for my daughter after a hospital stay and she absolutely loves it . It is very soft against the skin and very pretty . I am considering getting one in a different colour for myself .	1
I got these for my bridesmaids and they were great . Looked very nice . A good simple but elegant shoe . Wish they came in half sizes .	1
Nice sturdy material and the good part is that it 's quite comfortable I have no regrets it 's def worth the money .	1
the inside of the shoe was soft and comfortable . It was bought for a friend and as soon as she got it she put it on for the whole day . I will definitely have to purchase some more .	1
Should have listened to the other reviews but I wear a size 8-9 and decided to go with the 9 but they are a bit too large ... but my feet do n't slip out and this way I did n't get any blisters from wearing them all night ! Also they are not as shiny as they are in the picture but still a great shoe !	1
I have wide feet and I went out on a limb buying shoes online for the first time . These are very cute shoes . I get compliments on them all the time ! Nice bright red color to them and the chain makes them look flashy . They fit very comfortably and I would recommend these shoes to my friends and family . That 's how much I like them ! Definitely a good buy .	1
After having to return a previous pair because they were too big , I found the right ones . I usually wear 6.5 so I originally went up a size ( bad idea ) . I returned them and ordered a size 6 . They fit great . It takes a little while to get them broken in but that 's to be expected with nearly any shoe - especially for this price .	1
I like these , but do n't love . They 're cute , but do n't fit my feet well , i may have just ordered a wrong size . But love the heel , and buckle . May just take a little getting use to ... I 've only had a week .	1
I really like these clogs/shoes . I 've worn them about a half dozen times so far and they are very comfortable and exactly what I expected and wanted . I have arthritis in my big toes , and having the rigid sole helps really helps . Also there is a strap on the back that I can pull up on my heel that wears like a regular shoe and not a slip on clog ( that helps with not having to grip with your toes like you would in a clog/mule ) . But you do n't have to use the strap on the back ... ..you can wear like a regular clog/mule .	1
I bought the black ones on sale and then saw the tan colored ones on Amazon on sale and bought them as well ! I love these clog like & # 34 ; boots & # 34 ; and I get tons of compliments ! I wear then with my skinny jeans . I wear a 6 in all Ariat boots but got these in a 6.5 and they fit perfectly . Perfect toe room as well . You ca n't go wrong with these ... .get them ! ! ! !	1
Very comfy , wide toe box , super stylish and sexy . Love that they 're a slip-on , however , your foot does not slide around or feel unsecured . Rubber sole , so there is no slipping on wet flooring . Love them !	1
I 'm not sure if my foot is wide and I 've never known it before or if this shoe is just a tad narrow . I still wear it and have the same pair in brown . I just have to be cautious of how I stand so that my foot does n't appear to be swallowing the sandal . I can hardly tell i 'm even wearing it when I have it on which is great since I prefer to be barefoot !	1
This is a very cute shoe ! I have gotten a lot of compliments . The silver lookd almost bronze in some lights . The shoe does loosen up quickly which makes me think the quality is not great , but you ca n't beat the price !	1
I ordered these for prom ( I had a ball gown so my shoes were n't showing anyway ) . They 're great and I 've gotten a lot more use out of them afterwards than most people can say for their prom shoes . The only thing is the sizing is strange ... my feet fit perfectly on the sandal but the strap is way too big . I usually pull the strap past all the holes and push the metal clasp through the braided part of the shoe or else I would be tripping over myself because of looseness . But it works fine and they match with a lot : )	1
the color is even more pretty in person I was skeptic but I need to say no more buy it	1
I do n't understand all the bad reviews what do you expect from 12 dollar sandles ? ? You wear them a few times than they break that 's mostly how all cheap sandles are made , but I love mines I brought pewter color and so far they fit and the color is what I expected an off silver so people stop giving bad reviews if you want better quality go buy a 50 dollor pair of sandles	1
Fits great , looks great , and ships faster than the expected arrival date . I recommend these to anyone looking for an affordable , cute summer shoe .	1
I love these gold braided t-strap sandals . They are true to size , I wear an 8 . They do n't look cheap either . Well worth the $ 16 bucks I paid . Would buy again !	1
I would definitely recommend these sandals , they fit great , look great , and are comfortable too . The price was reasonabletoo .	1
This shoe is the right pattern for comfort , it has the strap going all the way around the ankle with the straps going down to the sole of the shoe . This part is perfect , however if one needs a sole that is soft enough to give the foot relief from pressure this shoe will not do that if you will be on your feet for very long .	1
Fits like it supose to , Looks nice , and workd for what I wanted . Happy with my purchse , would buy again .	1
perfect for every outfit and they fit great !	1
Simple sandals that give a chic look to your outfit . Can wear them with sun dresses , shorts , and even jeans if want to look casual . They are really comfortable too and for the price they are great ! !	1
These sandals are awesome . Good quality , stylish , and great fit . I am normally an 8 to 8 1/2 and I ordered an 8 and they fit perfect . I got the brown , but they are n't brown , they look bronze and shiny , like they do in the picture . They are fancy enough to wear with a nice dress or nice jeans . Ca n't beat the price either !	1
It 's a cheap shoe , but you should assume that going into it . They 're very cute though , as for comfort it 's just like any other plastic sandal . I got the Brown ones and they look just like the picture . I wear a size 9 and they were true to size for me . I 'd recommend them .	1
This sandal is very beautiful . I 'll admit it is for very narrow feet but I have those kind of feet so I do n't mind . It gives my foot tons of room and is very comfortable . Definitely recommend but only to people with narrow feet . The ankle strap did n't fit my small ankle at first so I put the little metal piece in the braided detail and it worked out . Love it !	1
They are a good fit . I bought 7-1/2 and they fit like I expected . The pewter color is pretty and the construction seems to be top-notch .	1
What a fun pin ! I have dozens and dozens of pins and buy too many at holiday time . But I could n't resist this little dazzler . Heck , it 's cheap and gaudy -- I think the metal is tin -- and the shipping costs more than the pin itself . For under $ 5 , it 's an excellent bargain . It 's so sparkly , you could get away with wearing it as if it 's really expensive.It 's unique : I have a whole slew of snowflake and star pins . I have 3-leaf shamrocks , 4-petal flowers , 5-point stars , 6-sided snowflakes and other sparkly ones with 8 and 12 points . But this has 7 rondels . What an odd little thing it is . So just for this uniqueness , consider getting it .	1
I ordered 3 of these pins . They shipped quickly but I noticed immediatly that one of the pins had a missing rhinestone ( one of the & # 34 ; floating & # 34 ; round ones within the & # 34 ; petals & # 34 ; of the flower ) but it did n't look broken ... it looked as if it was just a defect in the way the item was made . I called the seller ( sounded like calling someone 's personal home phone ) who shipped a replacement at no cost . None of the pins are perfectly symmetrical ( neither is the image in this listing ) but they are still good quality and a decent deal for the price + shipping . The pin in the back is hard to open/twist at first and I was afraid I was going to break it , but it opens without damage if you are careful . I do n't expect to keep these for more than a year , and anticipate that the metal will turn with everyday/outdoor wear ... but it 's still a decent deal . I purchased these to adorn the belt of a wedding gown- one day use- and they will be perfect . The seller was polite and offered quick shipping !	1
Purchased this for my cousin to include in her Bridal Bouquet . I think that this is the perfect size and I ca n't wait for her to receive it . I also purchased some others in a bundle offer , but for a bridal bouquet , I think that this is absolutely perfect in every way !	1
I was n't expecting much from this brooch except for its aesthetics . I bought it to take the place of an antique paste brooch much like it that I 'd mislaid , and wanted something similar to pin on my pashminas in the meantime . This one looked the most similar to the one I misplaced of any rhinestone or crystal brooches on Amazon , so I decided to order it.An item that only costs a single cent is hard to be disappointed in , but I 'm quite pleased with this ! The rhinestones are clear and have the same quality that my hundred-year-old paste brooch did - they 're sparkly and elegant , while in no way passing themselves off as diamonds ( though the stones have far less artificial `` fire '' than CZs ) . The size is tasteful - maybe a little bigger than the cap on a gallon of milk - and the prongs hold the stones fairly evenly , making me feel confident that this brooch wo n't lose stones as quickly as items that cost even more than a cent ! My one complaint , such as it is , is that the fastening holding the pin in place is stiff and a bit hard to work . But it does work , it does n't slip , and again , this brooch - and many others from the same company - only cost a cent . Standard Amazon shipping is often about $ 4 , and I paid less than that total.I 'll be purchasing other brooches from this company !	1
I bought these to add bling to my d & eacute ; cor . I will use them on my pillows and lamp shades . I may even use them on craft projects to sell .	1
Nice purse but had to return it due to the fact that it has a middle divider pocket so I could n't use my purse organizer with it . Other than that I love it !	1
well made and very affordable ! !	1
Not to big , but big enough to hold my iPhone , ( pretty big ) wallet , makeup bag , keys , and a few other items . It 's well and and a very pretty color . It has snaps on each side to close the purse . There 's a middle pocket that zips up and one zip pockets on one of the sides . I love it !	1
Love the color ( mint ) - its a blue-green color , perfect for spring.Its a great quality bag for the price ! I will recommend to friends & family !	1
I love this handbag , would like to have it in all colors , well organized . Inside compartments includes center zipper pouch and two pockets to accommodate cellphone and pens , etc . One outside zip storage also .	1
I searched and searched and finally found this purse after many returns . I really like it and have even received a few compliments !	1
The color was n't like in the picture . I ordered it for me but when received it , its too small for me . I have a larger wallet and like to be able to put anything in my purse . This purse is a medium size . I thought it would be large enough but it was n't . I gave the purse to my mom and she loves it . I did like the one handle . The inside is a light tan . It was a nice purse just not big enough for me	1
This is my first pair of shoes by Steve Madden . Since CHOCOLATE is my favorite color , these shoes where a MUST to add to my ever-growing shoe collection . I was hoping the shoe was the rich color as displayed on the website and they are . NOW to the feet ISSUES : # 1 . ) I am a size 9 1/2 and those of you out there who are the same size as me , probably experienced the same as me . I have narrow feet , and being a 9 1/2 , most stores usually do n't have the CUTE SHOES in 9 1/2 size , but they always seem to have plenty of size 10 , here in Miami . You ask to try on the size 10 , and you HOPE the size 10 fits , BUT it 's usually too wide , RIGHT ? ? ? Yeah , I KNOW cause it HAS happened to me MANY TIMES as well ! ! ! HOWEVER , I purchased the size 10 and to my surprise , they were not too wide . # 2 . ) Having almost no arch , before my work day ends I usually have to change into a flat , more comfortable shoe after wearing heels to work . However , I was able to wear this pair of shoes all day without having to change into flats . Therefore , this pair of shoes GREATLY MET MY EXPECTATIONS ! ! ! YAY ! ! ! : ) These shoe can be wore with anything and have become my FAVORITE pair of heels . They are well worth the cost and I recommend this pair of shoes . I plan to purchase more shoes by this manufacturer .	1
OK , I am a older woman , and I purchased these sandals . The quality is excellent , the size is true , and most important for me is that the heel is not to high . If you are trying to give your outfit an extra kick , this is the sandal to buy . So , so , nice . You will love this sandal , and yes , it is very comfortable .	1
As with my other pair I purchased , I just tried them on and walked around the house when I received them . This pair seemed a little tight around the ankle but might stretch a bit after wearing . But they look great on the foot . Heel is perfect height .	1
True to size and color is a nice rich brown material leather not bad at all and the price even nicer love them .	1
I was pleasantly surprise when these shoes were delivered because when I tried them on the heel was perfect , they are very comfortable . The best thing is they were on sale . I would recommend to anyone as they a double win ... style & comfort !	1
I probably would not buy another pair with the closed heel . It hits just in the wrong part of my Achilles tendon . I will try to soften the part that sticks up . Otherwise , the color is very nice . Due to foot issues , I have to wear Birkenstock , so it 's nice to have a different pair .	1
A little disappointed in the color , it seemed faded , other then that its nice , I have n't wore it yet , but I think it is going to be fine , arrived fast	1
Finally , beautiful prints for plus sizes . This shirt is light and airy and feminine . I wear a black turtleneck under it for cold weather and as is for Spring and Summer .	1
Its a beautiful top soft breathable summer material but definitely not worth that outrageous price . I would purchase another for less the offering price.Would recommend .	1
I bought this watch because the picture made it look very nice , but oh my gosh , the picture does n't half do the item justice . It 's 10x nicer ( at least ) . Also , the set-up is very easy ( just READ and follow the written directions and you should n't have any problem ) . I 'm old enough that having a watch I need to wind is not an issue . I could stare in fascination at the visible works for hours on end . The size of the face is perfect , 1.5 '' across with the cover open and only marginally smaller with the cover closed . The chain is sturdy , although the clasp that holds the watch to the chain is a bit delicate and malleable . Overall , a great value for the price .	1
My daughter got this as part of her costume for a living history ranch and it runs fine . It looks a bit cheap , but considering the excellent price , that 's okay . She uses it not only when in costume but also carries it around in her pocket every day .	1
Really neat watch , definitely unlike any watch I 've ever seen . I 'm giving it to my brother as a bridal party gift , and I think he 'll like it quite a bit . Only complaint was the box was crushed when it arrived , which made me worry the contents would be damaged , but they seem fine .	1
I bought this watch for my son as a gift . He loves it and carries it everywhere . Of course , I prefer an ol ' wrist watch , but he has always gravitated to pocket watches like his grandfather . For a 20 dollar watch , it feels sturdy , keeps good time , and comes with a watch chain . The watch chain clip is not as sturdy looking as the watch . The ability to see the mechanical interior is cool , and the two tone is nice . The glass over the face pops up if you want it to , and all the 20 somethings in his group of friends thought that was cool . In fact , when he sent them all the link to look at the watch and comment , several of them purchased the pocket watch too . He 's happy it was n't expensive , as he worries about taking care of an antique one , but for 20 bucks he ca n't go wrong with this one .	1
My daughter is into steampunk stuff and this seems to be exactly what she wanted . I had another old watch that was see through on both sides and she really was interested in that so I thought this would be cool . Comes in a nice little black box and a cloth with it . You just attach the chain , pop the winder up so you can set the time , and then like all wind up watches , just wind it a bit , do n't over crank it.Very cool looking and neat to watch all the gears ...	1
It is a decent pocket watch , that works . I bought it for a play and it is holding up well	1
In this age of uploads and downloads it is nice to have a peice of yesterday . It keeps perfect time ( if you remember to wind it ) and the fact that it has the & # 34 ; steampunk & # 34 ; finish is a beautiful touch . I have received several compliments from people usually asking if it was a family heirloom . I The frount and back allow you to see the inner workings of the watch and the gears in motion . And the price ? $ 19.90 delivered ? A steal . Very pleased..	1
I love and own a lot of different kinds of jewelery . Some funky , some costume . My dear FIL loves my Steampunk collection..I received this today . Hubby was blown away the workmanship and beautiful . Watch works well . Ca n't wait to show dad tomorrow	1
This dress looked so cute in the picture . Sadly , the bust area fits really strange , the fabric is rayon , ( do n't believe it said that in the description , or else I missed it ) , and the fabric is too thin for my liking .	-1
dress not as cute as in picture . i ordered a size small and the dress fits like an extra large . instead of money being wasted , i will give the dress to my mother . Also dress is way too long . Dress is way below the knee .	-1
I am pretty short and this did n't fit me right at all . I returned the next day for a full refund .	-1
It looked so beautiful in the photo , but when it arrived , what a disappointment , it 's shapeless and very large , the fabric looks cheap . I really wanted this to work , but is not like in the photo . I 'm a size 4 or 6 , I ordered a size Small and it was gigantic , with no waist or shape at all , it was like wearing a large sac of potatoes .	-1
I thought this was cute , but it did not look good on me at all . I can wear pretty much whatever I want to ... but this just looked like a sack .	-1
washed it and the bottom shrunk but the top did n't . so it is not wearable . called customer services , they said they ca n't take it back even it is not usable any more .	-1
I could n't even wear it . I just washed as soon as I received , as I do with all my clothes before I wear them , and it shrunk . It says tumble dry low and it is not suitable for a dryer . Now I have a blouse than can be worn for my nice that is 10 years old . Waste of money ! ! ! !	-1
First of all this top is not very well made and was way overpriced for what you get ! ! All tops in the same size were different , some smaller , some larger , shorter , longer . I went through several tops in two colors before I found one that was not twisted , had an even hem and neck opening , and did n't have snags and pulls and other problems . Second , it shrunk at least 2 inches , if not more , lengthwise after I washed it . It 's boxy and I was actually hoping it would shrink in shoulders and sides for more fitted look : ) I am glad I bought small , though xs looked a bit better in store ( keep reading ) . I did not dry it in the dryer . I do n't really care about banded tops but I loved the color and it looked good when I tried it in store . I even bought a matching bra to go with this top ! I do not like layering , if you buy white one you will need a cami underneath , red and green ( yes it 's green , not blue as shown ) can be worn without cami but because of embroidery in front you can not wear i.e . white bra with it , it will be obvious , even black bra does n't look good in my opinion . The neck is very wide as well , front is OK , but it 's low and open in the back , and not very comfortable.The fit become awful after the top shrunk , too short plus stupid elastic pulls everything up , not enough material to drape nicely . BUT ladies , I removed elastic . It 's easy to do , you do not need to have any skills , do n't need to play around with stitches , just cut elastic through one of the holes ( patterns ? ) in embroidery and pull it out , this way you will add some length . The top drapes nicely and fits so much better now . I would n't wear it anywhere but around the house , but at least I do n't have to throw it away ! I give it 3 stars because it 's wearable , and I still like the color ( green ) . I would not buy it again , I was going to order red ( more rusty/orange than pictured ) , but no , thank you.EDIT : I have to lower my rating . I wore this top for max 3 days , and washed twice . Today , after a second wash , I found two holes , there were a few tiny knots in the fabric , it looks like they are coming apart . I fixed them and can still wear it around the house but I do not recommend buying it at any price , do n't waste your money .	-1
This dress looks like a bed sheet and the shoulder part is too tight across the chest area . I do not recommend this dress for anyone with a medium or large bust size .	-1
The left glove came with 3 small holes in the seam plus they role at the top . The gloves do not have much lateral stretch so the are difficult to pull up . If you have larger arms I do n't think these would fit at all . I should have sent them back but did n't ( my bad ) , but i will not buy again .	-1
These are t-shirt material and the seams on the thumb holes were both hanging off when I received them . Wore them for a few hours and they already stretched out .	-1
I was hoping the material would be a little thicker . It would , indeed , be good for dress up . I bought it to hide surgical scars on forearm . The product was delivered as promised and on time . Packaging material was perfect . Not a problem with product or the way it was delivered other than I wanted material to be a little thicker .	-1
worst material ever . It will rip the second you rub against anything sharp . They constantly fell down to my wrists and they were super super tight .	-1
I was so prepared to love this skirt , and while I was n't expecting perfection , I received something truly ugly . Five layers is actually four , the lining ( the layer that makes the skirt wearable in public ) barely covered by butt while the sheer level went on to past my knee . It is not even close to being as full as it is in the picture . It bunches at the waist creating bulges at the hips and the illusion of being much heavier than you are . I am 5'5 & # 34 ; and 110 pounds and this skirt made me look like I was expecting ! ! The waist band is a hideous shiny cheap costume material and wo n't stay flat , the sewing is awful and I could not imagine a way to make it wearable . I am going to give it to Goodwill and maybe some toddler can wear it as a dress-up dress , but even they might be dissatisfied . Unfortunately , it would cost more to ship it back than I paid for it . Steer clear .	-1
This skirt looks nothing like the photo . It 's very see-through and flat . You can see the cheap looking lining clearly through the few layers of voile . And that 's somewhat see-through too . The waist has an elastic band running through it , but since it 's not sewn to the waist material , it twists and bunches up inside instead of laying flat . This might be good to layer underneath another skirt , but I would never wear it alone . All I can think is that the models are wearing 2 or 3 of these skirts at once for the amount of coverage and poofiness that the photos are showing.I know , I know ... what did I expect for $ 13 ?	-1
Save your money . It is not what you are looking for . It looked like a cheap slip and had lots of runs in the material . My boyfriend HATED it . Too good to be true .	-1
Cons : I found thread coming out as soon as I took this dress out of the packaging.The shoulder area was not sewn correctly , nor was the bottom of the skirt.It was unwearable , until I took my sewing machine and re-touched the whole dress.Pros : It was cheap .	-1
If you ever worked in a fast food restaurant as a teenager and had to wear those polyester uniforms , this feels EXACTLY LIKE THAT.I took it out of the bag and immediately threw it in the trash . it was so repulsive , I just wanted to destroy it as quickly as I could.What 's worse ? I BOUGHT TWO ! ! ! I guess the joke 's on me.Save your money and keep shopping .	-1
Its like costume quality . The cut is very odd . Did n't look like the picture . The inside lining stick out and makes it look so cheap .	-1
quality is not good . jacket is in the bottom of my drawer and I never wear it because of the quality of the fabric . Looks cheap	-1
I 'm not too please with this , I like to return the two jackets back.I & # 34 ; m not too sure if I should had order an bigger size . but , it fits to small .	-1
This product is thin , leaving nothing to the imagination . It is also very clingy , and very tight . It was really not at all a flattering look .	-1
It fit so narrowly ( even though I ordered in XL ) that it was no longer a Maxi skirt - it pulled up to mid-calf . This is not for the mature figure but teens and slender ladies might find it fits well .	-1
I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY WIFE AND SHE TOLD ME IT IS TOO LARGE , THIN , CHEAP , WITHOUT FORM AND IT MUST COST PROBABLY 5 DOLLARS THEN IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE .	-1
I 'm 5'10 . This skirt was too short for me . Maxi skirts are supposed to touch your feet , and this went up to my calves . It looked ridiculous . I went with another brand instead .	-1
I was excited about this since I saw so many good reviews but all this skirt did was make me look way heavier than I am ( I even sized up to be safe ) . Also this was way too see thru to wear without something beneath it .	-1
Not at all what I expected . Very thin material , too small . Can see through the material , looks very cheap . Sent it back .	-1
I wear S and the S fits like XS or XXS . The color charcoal looks not like on the picture or I have got a wrong color . I gave it for charity .	-1
The skirt fit great at first but then stretched way out . Had to keep yanking it up . Then when I washed it , per label instructions , it shrunk length wise . Needless to say not a happy purchase .	-1
Runs very small . Get at least 2 sizes bigger than normal . Also , very short . I 'm 5'8 and it did n't go past my ankles . Looked really silly . I returned them immediately .	-1
I ordered a & # 34 ; medium & # 34 ; but it came extra , extra large . So large around the waist that when I tried to use a belt around it , it did n't work . It was bulging out in places that made it look ridiculous . Material was ok quality but way too long for me as well . I 'm petite so maybe this skirt is good for a much taller person . But definitely this & # 34 ; medium & # 34 ; size is actually an XXL . Be warned before you purchase !	-1
This skirt is not made for anyone who has curves . I 'm 5'0 140lbs so I ordered the med since I wasnt completely sure if the small would fit.Well , I received the skirt before the target due date and I was excited but my excitement turned quickly to disappointment . The way it 's cut you cant comfortably wear the skirt without the waist band rolling down and looking tacky.So then I thought I 'll pull it up like a dress , nope not possible unless you have curves but flat on top which im not . The skirt is perfect for a girl with no curves or very little curves.The army green is a very nice color and easy to color to find a top to go with .	-1
Gorgeous , but so incredibly see through . The five star ratings are so disappointing . I bought the black and the dark purple , and both are unwearable . Returned them both , and am hoping to get others not to waste their time as well .	-1
Description states that the skirt has a stretchable waistband not a fold over waistband ... .that I hate . So I guess Im supposed to pay 7.00 to send a 10.00 skirt back ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?	-1
I 'm not thin nor THAT tall . Skirt arrived beautifully , long and clingy . loved it . One wash , and BOOm like the shrinkie dinks . Sits at waist , but hem just barley below my knee now ( 5'9 & # 34 ; here ) and still wants to slid off my hips . I carry weight in the middle , but if ya got a waist and a booty to hold this skirt up then I recommend , with a pin to hold it up . Otherwise , , its going to shrink , in the lenght and look 80 's and you 'll be hiking this thing up more than a yedi on Everest with a Yockel	-1
I bought 2 skirts . The first black and white skirt was supposed to be an extra large but was incredibly small . I wore the black one today and had to keep pulling it up ! Ca n't win here . Am sorely disappointed and unless some amends are made , sadly I wo n't be purchasing from this seller .	-1
The color that I received was black not the cavier pictured , also , I am a size 8 ( on the smaller side of an 8 but still an 8 ) . I ordered a medium and this shows every little curve around my bottom and thighs . I 'm 5'8 & # 34 ; and foolishly did n't heed other warnings about length ( I measured and the stated 40 & # 34 ; should have been okay ) but the skirt is actually slightly shorter than 40 & # 34 ; and on me that makes it too short . The way the model is standing makes it hard to tell but it is actually slightly tapered in on the legs . This would require you to wear a thong as the fabric is so thin that you can see any underwear marks even on the thinnest pair . I was so excited for this an am utterly disappointed . .	-1
I ordered this skirt the first time from somebody else . Loved it so I ordered my sister one since her birthday was coming up . Needless to say , it 's no where near the first one I bought . So I go back to try to figure out what happen . Someone else has sold me the skirt . I do n't understand , because I ordered it thru My Orders . Which should 've meant it came from the same Place . NOPE . TERRIBLE . I DON & # 34 ; T UNDERSTAND . ANY WAY I threw it in the trash . That 's how bad it was . Besides , would 've cost me more time and money to send back .	-1
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ! This skirt is paper thin , see through and cheap ... ... I guess you ask , what did you expect for $ 14 and you 're right ... Disappointing pretty much sums it up ... ... Prime example of you get what you pay for ... ..	-1
This skirt is poorly made and made with the cheapest , sheerest material out there . It 's the shiniest polyester/rayon blend I have ever seen , so even if it fit ... Even if it was n't completely see-through , I could never wear it and not be completely embarrassed . If you could see the seems on this skirt ... . Ridiculous amount of puckering ... all the way up the back ... Horrible..Do not waste your money on this skirt or this manufacturer .	-1
The fabric is very thin and for it being a size L it 's too small . This would go more for a size M , or junior size even .	-1
I bought this skirt based on the reviews . I was very disappointed . The color was great . I ordered the army green . But the material was very thin . You could see every dimple in your body . I own several of these skirts and none are this thin . Plus it 's not a real maxi . I 'm 5'5 and found myself trying to adjust it to make it a maxi . I will give it away or it will be a house skirt .	-1
The color is horrible . It was so pretty on line . But , you can literally see right through it . Neither slips nor leggings work correct under this skirt ... bummer	-1
The skirt was too short to be a maxi skirt . Plus it 's not very thick . If your short then it would be perfect .	-1
This is a very flimsy skirt . The first day I wore it , the waist stretched out of shape so that it no longer fit smugly . Very disappointed .	-1
This thing is so thin , and it 's not close knit , more like open knit . I guess you get what you pay for.. Shipping took a long time since it 's from china..	-1
Waited almost 2 months for the cheeziest thin and NOT over-sized hat and will be very careful to look for source of origin on products from now on . Had I known ! I ca n't even wear it and will give it away . What head will this fit ? A 5 yr old , a cabbage patch doll ? ?	-1
I got this for a gift , I love the oversized beanies but this is not oversized or baggy at all . It has a weird shape and fit to it . Also the material is not soft at all . I will not wear this !	-1
this is supposed to look like the titanic . I received this necklace in very poor condition . the blue heart has a chunk missing out of it so it actually has a hole chipped into it . very disappointed with this necklace	-1
This top would be really cute if it did n't have a weird tie on the shoulder . It 's out of place and awkward and was not shown in the photos at all .	-1
Not really sure how that happens . But I ordered up a size because the medium was a bit tight on my hips and thighs . Those were a medium . Which I normally wear in a women 's lounge wear . So I liked them so much , I ordered two more pair in a large thinking that should be fine . Just for around the house . Well , let me tell you . These are so uncomfortable I ca n't wear them again . I was constantly pulling them out of my wahoo everytime I stood up . They crept down my butt the whole time too . And this is without them being folded down . I just do n't why a large would fit smaller than a medium . Quite odd and disappointed to say the least . Sure , these were a great deal . But it 's not so great if you ca n't enjoy wearing them . So unless you are a twig with no shape , do n't waste your money . If your curvy , it 's a no win situation .	-1
At first they seem great- great fit , light weight , perfect length . However not long after you start wearing them on a weekly basis they are too thin , slightly see through , and they loose their elasticity quickly . So now it am constantly pulling them up . I only wear them to sleep in now .	-1
They fall down . I regret buying this yoga pants . They are extremely uncomfortable because they do not stay in place .	-1
There is no way I would ever wear these pants outside of my house or for that matter where anyone not in my immediate family could see me wearing them . The fabric is very thin . Definitely not something you would want to wear to the gym .	-1
I like the cost of the stainless steel rings but the stone I do n't believe is crystal but more like a hard plastic . One problem with ordering from amazon is they do n't include a return label in case you want to return an item . I also buy from HSN and you always get a return slip with every order . It 's very difficuld to return products from Amazon , for this reason I may stop buying from Amazon	-1
But they colors are not the same as picture but it will do that 's why I have one star other than that yes I will wear it and it was affordable	-1
i really like this belt , but it does not stay straight , it rolls up and almost twists each time i stand up.i am an x-large / 1x . this belt fit around my stomach good , until i moved aroundi wore it once over a plain black dress ... and although i did get a compliment , i will not wear it again.and because i wore it , i am not able to return it	-1
All day at work its was slipping . The buckle keeps turning and its starting to tear from buckle turning . Its way over priced .	-1
turn colors after wearing for week	-1
These shoes were very cute just like the picture and shipping was fast . However , they were very uncomfortable & the pin for the buckle was too short to secure the strap . I will be returning these ASAP .	-1
It 's soooo cute ! Buuut it 's going to break within the first week of owning it . The metal is soft and if you put anything slightly heavy in it the chains break . I had to but new chain for mine and make a project out of it just to use it	-1
It stunk . I though it would make a good cheap beach bag , but it was too poorly made to keep . I like high quality things so I should have known better for the price .	-1
Its so freaking cheap	-1
Cheap . The handles tore off after less than a week of light to moderate use . It looks cheaply made because it is.The fake leather is n't even nice looking fake leather . It 's obviously plastic . The concept of the bag and the colors of the stripes are a nice idea , but it is so poorly made , it does n't even matter . I ignored the bad reviews , and wasted my money anyway . If you buy this , you will wish you had n't wasted your money . Spend more for high quality . This is n't it !	-1
This bag is adorable , but the chain on the straps broke very quickly	-1
when I a got the bad , I like it.. but after using it for 2 days the chain broke , i di n't even put that much stuff inside but it did n't last me long anyways . I dont recoment this item .	-1
My hubby liked it although the material was not scratch proof and it tarnished quickly . Surprisingly , it was fine due to the price . No big expectations .	-1
I am a solid 8 and my toes felt crammed into these and they were n't comfortable . I felt I needed an 8.5 . The zipper also was n't smooth . The toe shape was too almond shaped . Returned .	-1
These boots look fantastic but feel like they are made of stone . You can not move your foot in them particularly the instep which is so stiff it inhibits movement.Do not buy these boots unless you just want to put them on and stand in them for a photo !	-1
I usually love this style of shoe , though I went from the Patricia to the Patricia 2 because of the same issue . The straps across the top of the foot are too tight , and leave strap marks on my feet . I do NOT have fat feet -- I 've only ever had issues with these and the Patricia when they changed the design .	-1
I was hoping these shoes would be my solution to never wearing high heels again ... maybe my hopes were too high ! : PFirst , I really do n't like the & # 34 ; crocs & # 34 ; label on the front ! When I wear crocs , I usually do n't want anyone to know they 're crocs ! I like to surprise people with it , but that kind of killed it for me ... Plus , it 's not cute ! Second , they were just too clunky looking for my taste , the ribbing on the bottom made them almost look like hiking boots ! As soon as I put them on , i said & # 34 ; Nope ! & # 34 ; The rest of the crocs I bought I love ! but these shoes will not be replacing my high heels anytime soon	-1
I have normal width feel and these were severely narrow . I had another pair of cross -- same heel height -- that was excellent . That model stopped being manufactured , so I bought the Cyprus as a replacement . They were so painful , I returned them the same day I bought them ! There is no break-in period for Crocs because of the material ( high grade plastic ) . It does n't stretch or mold over time , so how it feel at first wear is how it will continue to feel .	-1
First of all , the product description says & # 34 ; leather & # 34 ; . It 's not . Therefore , these are not so soft . They 're rather smallish in the toe area while a bit too long , so the back of the shoe is loose . But the main reason why I 'm returning these is because the edges are hard on skin , especially on the sides next to the ball of the foot area . I can not even stand in these , needless to say , unable to walk .	-1
Looks like something you 'd see at walmart . The colors are cheap looking and the material does n't form to the body . Will not buy again .	-1
these came directly from China absolutely reeking of glue . The foot bed is very narrow and the toe strap is very uncomfortable - and they usually never bother me . Sad to say I have to return them .	-1
I ended up keeping it but it is for a younger person- Sleeves to puffy and very short in back- They were very nice and offered to take it back but I will give it to someone else- I will probably donate it to my vintage store- very nice people to deal with- I would recommend them babs	-1
I need to be fair . the bag looks like the photo and on time delivery . 2 stars are for that . but there are no brand/ manufacturer name/ certificate or anything else either on the bag or written inside it or even name on zippers . it said price came down from near 300 $ to near 70 $ , but how could you believe it when you have no idea where/who made it ? it does n't look like genuine leather as well . smells like plastic . when you pay almost 80 bucks ( including tax and shipping ) you deserve to know where this product made and who made it . I kind of sure it is Chinese manufactured and syntactic leather . Do n't be fooled by good reviews about it , like I did . now I have to pay for return like I did for the initial shipping . loosing almost 15 bucks for a nice photo	-1
The bag is very pretty but it has a horrible horrible smell . I put it outside for a few days and the smell still remains.I will be returning this bag .	-1
This sweater is not at all as described . It is not loose or long or even the right color . It is tiny ! Even for regular standards , its short , the sleeves are mid-sleeve and not baggy like in the image . The hem of the sweater doesnt even reach my hips . And its not stretchy either . To top it off , its almost a yellow-white color like aged paper and not a creme color at all . So incredibly upset about this purchase .	-1
I have ordered many tops from this company and have NO complaints but this shirt was so thin in material as well as not even close to being as loose or slouchy as they show in photo . I always order a size larger as this company makes for smaller frames and never had an issue and did the same in this case but it really is not made to be slouchy BUT it is a nice plain thin sweater for everyday use just not what pictured at all and I will continue to order from this maker as truly one wrong photo is n't enough to ruin all the great stuff I have had from them..	-1
this sweater is nothing like the picture online . its as flimsy as a peice of paper , im scared to put it on cause it might rip or fall apart . its very sheer so put something under it , its not a heavy bulky winter sweater and thats what i thought , but you get what you pay for and it was cheap ...	-1
Why too thin and cheap feeling . See through , and not in a good way . Fits oddly . I have worn it once in about a year . And I love sweaters . Do n't bother with this .	-1
These items are made fast and cheap . I fell for it . The ship from Hong Kong and you pay mucho to return . Clothes have a highly toxic smell . A no no .	-1
So I got this top the other day and I thought they sent me the wrong top , it was small and did n't have a wide neck AT ALL . But the only good thing about this sweater is that it 's so easy to stretch . I made the sleeves longer and I actually pulled it off my shoulder until I heard it rip haha , you ca n't see any rips but I made it into an off the shoulder top !	-1
I was hoping it 'd be okay.. but this was the strangest sweater I 've ever tried on . It fit like.. a garbage bag.. tight in some places but not in others . Too small ... weird ... The material was interesting though .	-1
The sweater has n't a good quality material and it is very big . I knew It was a large when I bought it but if I had liked the material I would have worn it as a dress	-1
This sweater was so loosely knitted , you could see daylight all the way through it . Closer to a doily that a sweater , in the way it made . I wo n't be wearing it . Maybe if I was in my 20 's sure . But , alas , I am not anywhere close to my 20 's . Plus , it just does n't fit right . Sorta like it 's twisted . Just not right . I ca n't recommend this & # 8203 ;	-1
I took a chance on this sweater bc it looked super cute in the picture . The quality was n't the best , had a funky plastic smell , and felt kinda scratchy . The worst part was although I ordered a large , it could have fit my 12 year old niece quite snugly ... .not at all comfy and baggy like the photo.The only reasons it got 2 stars was Amazons free returns policy and the speediness with which arrived ... .but definitely being returned ! !	-1
Unfortunately , the photo and description are misleading . I purchased a Large/US12 . I am 5'8 & # 34 ; and wear a US 8-10 . This sweater barely covers my belt loops , does n't reach my wrists , and I am short-waisted/long legged . I do n't even mind the thin , cheap fabric for this price , but I am pretty disappointed in the significantly inaccurate sizing . Unless you are very petite , the sweater will not look like the picture on you .	-1
not at all as described . it is very small . looks like it would fit a teenage girl . very poor quality . i am just going to donate to my local rescue mission . would not recommend to any body	-1
I ordered this sweater so I could wear it with leggings but when I got it , it is at my waist . The model in the picture must be very tiny bc Ive seen this on several orders that were suppose to be long and wasnt . The material is soft but very thin . Scoop neck is more like V neck . I was very disappointed with this sweater .	-1
The model must be a child for the sweater to fit as loose as it does in the picture . I ordered a Large and this does not fit loose . The yarn is stiff and very thin . It might make a better summer sweater but not fall or winter . I hope to return .	-1
The model in the picture must be about 4 feet tall and 80 pounds and wearing an extra large . I ordered a large so I could wear it with leggings and it comes to my waist like a regular sweater . its super thin and the fabric feels like plastic . I am returning it	-1
This sweater is exactly as pictures in style and color but very small . I ordered an XL and it is so small I gave it to my daughter who wears a size 8 .	-1
small in arms and in length . I am 5'4 & # 34 ; and just came down to my crotch , I was expecting a longer and baggy fit..just made me look like a tank .	-1
the sweater is short , good for jeans but not legging as I intended . the sleeves are long . will not order from this company again . Image is a misrepresentation description is a misrepresentation . My search was for over sized sweaters not sweaters with extremely long sleeves . STAY AWAY ! Unless you 're a small 10 year old female then this is the sweater for you ! ! !	-1
Kind of to big , need belt to accessorize it . Good price but a bit boxy fit . I guess pair it up with tights /boots /belt	-1
The sleeves are too short . The reason for my purchase was for the long sleeves in the picture . It was rather disappointing to find that it was not that length .	-1
I order this a size bigger than usual because i wanted it big and to look like the picture . It fits short and wide , not like the photo.The material is not very good quality and it looks unfinished , but not in a fashionable way	-1
I went through the reviews before purchasing this sweater and I should have taken them more seriously . The sweater that came in the mail for me is NOT the same sweater pictured here . For 1 , I received the yellow sweater , which looks more greenish than yellow , not black like I had wanted . The sweater from the photo is comfortable looking , billowy and roomy . Also it has a wide boat neck and appears to be fairly long . The sweater that I opened is short , I ordered a large and I am 5'6 and about 150 lbs . It fits me like a normal sweater . It 's a little snug , and if I was any heavier than I am now , I would n't be able to wear it . The neck is a vneck , not a boat neck . I do n't hate the sweater I got , It is n't awful looking and I will wear it , but its not what I wanted . I 'm really disappointed . This is the 2nd purchase I have made with this clothing company and both times , I have been dissatisfied . I do not think I will be buying from them again . Buyer , beware .	-1
I was so happy to wear this sweater the first time . It 's cozy , cute and warm . However , it got caught on everything ! My pen I was writing with , several times , my key chain , several times , I was able to pull the threads back together the first 5-6 times but the last time it caught on my key chain ( it 's a regular key chain ) , it pulled a loop out so far , I 've not figured how to fix it.Also it does n't look ANYTHING like the picture ! The bottom is straight across , no cute curved bottom hem ( or whatever ) . The area under the arm pits is extra , extra 'bat wing ' style ( ? ) and I think that 's how I kept catching it on everyday items.It 's very soft and cozy , but it 's so delicate . I do n't know how that model was able to where that necklace and a huge bag without catching them in a loop of the sweater ? ! ? Mine looks way & # 34 ; worn in & # 34 ; , or worn out is more like it , with all of the knit loops that have pulled out sooooooo far ! ! ! Feels great , does n't hold up well at all ! !	-1
This is poorly made and hardly a winter sweater ... it is very thin and the yarn is cheap . Cute for 12 year old IMO who may get just one or two wears out of it because any little snag to the yarn will ruin it . Save your money for Wal-Mart where you can probably get a better quality sweater for the same price . ( The seller is a good seller and this is not intended to reflect anything negative towards the seller ... .it is the product that I do n't care for )	-1
cheap sweater , cheap material , cheap look , big disappointment , will never wear it , looks like a rag unflattering and all the seams are visible	-1
Does n't show really what its made of in the picture . I kinda wish I did n't buy it because I do n't wear it .	-1
This sweater WOULD be really cute if it actually fit like it does in the picture . I ordered a large , which I usually wear , but the sweater I received was teeny tiny . I 'm only 5'3 & # 34 ; and it just reached my hips , but if I lifted my arms the whole sweater shoots up to my bust . it does n't hang like the picture and it certainly is n't big , baggy and comfy . It 's short , boxy and itchy ! Beware if you 're a somewhat curvy girl like me !	-1
I know this is an inexpensive item , but it looks way too cheap and fits poorly . The other two items I bought from this vendor ( also very inexpensive ) actually look and fit much nicer . I ordered a size larger and it still only sits at my waist ( not at my hips or thighs as pictured on model ) . ( I am 5'4 & # 34 ; and 135 lbs ) This sweater is also way see-through , which is ok if you wear something underneath , but the neckline just does n't sit right when you do . It seems off-balance no matter what you wear underneath . It also looks a little frayed at the neckline . Save your money and buy another item from Allegra K .	-1
I got a large and I usually wear a small ... but I like the oversized look , but it was closer to medium than large ... .if Xlarge is available than get that if you want that look on a small frame .	-1
I order a large so it may fit as the photo.. It 's so small , does not drop like the photo . It 's way above the waist and the sleeves are to my elbows it 's fitted and had few holes . Not even worth returning . I 'll just trash it .	-1
Cheap , looks like a 5th grader knitted it . Thought it was a cute mustard yellow color its actually a puke yellow . Kept it to see if I would just wear it around the house . But I cringed every time I saw that color in my closet . I dumped it in a donation box . Very disappointing .	-1
Very cheap material , and the color is a pukey green , not mustard yellow . Also , I 'm a size 12 , and it fit perfect , like a regular sweater , not oversized , as is had hoped . And again ... .very cheap looking .	-1
Not what it looked like , real thin and v neck not scoop . Was n't what I thought it would be like .	-1
I ordered a size L for this sweater , and I received an XS , that fortunately did fit my daughter ; she likes it very much . The style is very good and trendy ; I previously had the black color ordered , and I was so pleased w/it when I received it , that I ordered the yellow color right away . Too bad , I did not have the same luck w/it !	-1
i actually picked a size bigger than usual because i wanted it to look just like the picture . Wrong , it 's short and super wide . the material is not very good and it looks unfinished but not in a fashion way .	-1
it was nothing like what i am seeing now . i did not have a return slip so i will give it to someone	-1
This sweater did not fit correctly . Shoulders and arms were too tight . I ordered the same sweater from another company and the fit was perfect ! I did not want to take the time and money to return this item back to China . I previously had a horrible experience with mailing items back to China .	-1
I hate this shirt . I usually like allegra clothes , for what I pay its typically fair quality . But this shirt seemed to belong on a mannequin for alterations . The collar , sleeves and hem felt incomplete , like somebody cut out 2 matching patterns in a home economics class and just sewed them together . Sorry allegra , you guys dropped the ball on this piece .	-1
I ordered these in my regular size and they were at least two sizes too small . I would n't consider these to be wide calf , more like slightly larger than normal . The zipper is terrible , you have to pull really hard to get it to move , I would be scared it would break after just a couple wears . I returned these a day after I got them . They look so cute , but the sizing of these made them such a disappointment .	-1
The shoes can on time . Ordered a size 10M . The box stated size 10M . The shoes on the other hand was a 8 1/2 . Very disappointing .	-1
I wanted to like this shoe - loved the color and style when I saw it on line . Was n't enamored with the style until it arrived , but thought it would compliment some suits . Once I tried them on , I knew immediately I would be returning them . They were very uncomfortable .	-1
I had such high hopes for this shrug , because I love the style . Unfortunately , it was so small I could hardly get my arms into it , much less wear the thing . I had to return it ...	-1
I do not recommend this at all . It is super thin , runs about 2 sizes too small and I will be surprised if does n't fall apart the first time I wash it .	-1
Very blah ... . I had really hoped to like it . I like the long , sloppy sweater look over tshirt s , so even though I am a 10-12 , I bought a 2x . A medium would have been skin-tight ... a 2x fit me , and was n't that big on a 10 year old who tried it on .	-1
I own many pairs of Nine West shoes , both flat and heels , and I love them all ... except these . I ordered the size that fits me perfectly in my other Nine West shoes and they were a little small . That would probably be OK , they 'd stretch a little . The real problem is that halfway through my first day of wearing them , both of my heels were bleeding from the shoes ! Ouch ! I 've bought several pairs of flats recently and this is the only pair that did that .	-1
Let me start by saying half of my shoes are Nine West , and I love the brand . However , maybe because these are patent , they did not conform to my foot at all . Instead , they gapped very noticeably at the sides with every step . I sent them back .	-1
I 've ordered several items from this company and all have been ok , but not this one . 1st , it 's not even a cardigan ! It 's sewn together . 2nd , the smell is horrid ! Like gasoline or a chemical . I washed and still stinks . 3rd , it 's falling apart . And last , it 's extra extra extra small . If you order beware and order 2 sizes up . FYI ... .the fit is awkward and itchy . Not good ! ! !	-1
It looks NOTHING like the picture . It is sewn together down the front , it 's short , sleeves are 3/4 at the most , it is saggy/stretched out around the bottom hem . also snags in fabric and smells weird	-1
This is not a long sleeve sweater , it 's only 3/4 sleeve . I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing . It 's also very , very STIFF , not loose and slouchy like the picture .	-1
I purchase many items from Allegra , but this sweater was absolutely nothing what I viewed online . It shows the length of the arms to be at wrist and down covering your bottom . NOPE ! I received a sweater that was large in size , but went to my elbow and right below my breasts . It looked like a tub top covering right under my bra . Not happy and I was so disappointed when I asked for a return that the company told me they would give me $ 2.00 back for a purchase that I spent a little over $ 16.00 for . Then I stated I would write a letter to Amazon and they replied to send it back , but that I would have to pay the return shipping . That would be $ 7- $ 10 and I that that was unfair . It was not what I purchased and was a very odd shape . I will no longer purchase anything from Allegra .	-1
It does look cute , but I ca n't wear it until I get that smell off . I will send it to the dry cleaner 's , may be they can help .	-1
NOT AS THE PICTURE SHOW IT TO BE IT WAS SHORT AND THE SLEEVES WHERE 3/4 IT STOPPED ABOVE MY WAIST AND I ORDERED IT IN THE LARGEST SIZE AVAILABLE I HAD TO RETURN IT WAS NO GOOD FOR ME I HAVE TO RETURN IT ASAP	-1
Size is way too very small on my 22lb 1 year old ! Very had to sit over her feet and hands .	-1
This is really uncomfortable and small . Its a cute idea- but a tankini and shorts sewn together just is n't working	-1
the size was too small . the look not what i saw on the pictures . I am returning this item due to poor quality	-1
It was cuter in the picture , cheaply made . The price was n't bad but now I know why , shipping took for ever ! I ordered 3 and only received one .	-1
Bought this from Best Deal Store . This item started to fall apart from day one . Wore it one day and the clasp came off . Managed to fix it and then a couple of days later the entire string holding the cross came off . It looks like a Beautiful item really and it probably could have been but the clasp just ruined it all .	-1
Nice but impossible to get one yourself	-1
So cheap . Broke within days of receiving it . It did come earleje than expected and I love that it 's cute but seriously it was n't worth my money at all .	-1
I did n't expect this to be high quality . I thought it would be worth the price if I could get at least a couple wears it of the bracelet . But the chain broke while putting it on for the first time ! Did n't even get to wear it once !	-1
The bracelet looks exactly like it does in the photo but it popped the first day I wore it . I made it to my office , sat down , I looked down and it was on my desk . Not so cute anymore	-1
Love the actual bracelet , but disappointed w chain clousure as broke after first wearing.. But ? Honestly for the price ? Could n't expect more.. Very cute though & have my sons girlfriend one as well ! Nice stocking stuffer ! !	-1
I bought this because I was specifically looking for some nylon tanks to wear to Bikram yoga . Polyester traps in the heat whereas nylon breathes more . I 've got tons of polyester tops with & # 34 ; wicking & # 34 ; capabilities but I start to roast in the middle of yoga class when I wear them . Unfortunately , polyester is everywhere is nylon is much harder to come across these days . The tag on this tank clearly indicates it is 90 % polyester , 10 % spandex . Another tank to add to my & # 34 ; do not wear to yoga & # 34 ; pile ... .Aside from the misinformation about what this tank is made out of , I 'm not that impressed . I am a 36 AA and typically wear a small or medium in exercise tops . This is advertised as a compression top so I expected it to be tight but it is VERY tight and not really that stretchy . I 'm not convinced it would stretch to accommodate a much larger person without riding up with every movement . The description also states it can be worn long or short but it barely hits the top of my hips when pulled all the way down so unless you have an incredibly short torso , do n't expect to be able to wear this over your butt as the picture shows.Would not buy this again .	-1
color true to pic but the pic shows it to be longer than it is in real life-definitely does not go past belt	-1
How can I review on a product that I have n't gotten . I am very upset because I ordered these leggings almost two weeks ago and I wanted them for my vacation..	-1
nothing too much nice ... should wear them for the gym ... not for dates ...	-1
These pants are like most yoga pants . I 'm 5'10 and 200lb ( well distributed ) and ordered a large ( which is normal for me ) . These were too short and did n't have the bell bottom look in the picture . The seam before the fold over sat directly below my hip bones , which was a little lower than I really wanted . The fabric was a nice material and the color is true to the picture , but I ended up giving these away . They looked like they might have fit me at one point but I shrunk them in the wash .	-1
Fit was ok around bust but so much loose fabric around waist . Not especially flattering , but the quality was nice .	-1
Color was nice but pretty sheer . Literally coming apart as I 'm putting it on . Very disappointed . I also purchased 2 dresses from the same company as well and returned both of those . Extremely poor construction . Basically disposable clothing .	-1
The boot is so cute there 's no doubt about that . The reviews mentioned that the zipper was cheap and I think you just need to be careful with the zipper and squeeze , then zip . I wear a size 10 and I do have a wide foot , but not at the top of my foot . The shoe fit fine everywhere expect the top of the foot . I decided to try them out and walk around for awhile . I even drove in them and after a few minutes they where cutting off my circulation ! I had to return them . It 's too bad the style is so so great !	-1
Really made for people with big calfs ... I generally do n't send shoes back EVER but there was no making these work ...	-1
Too expensive to return given price ... fine but light support ... I will just sew band tighter . Got a XXL for a 40 inch band ... too big by at LEAST 4 inches ... charts way off .	-1
These leggings are described as having buttons . The decorations are not buttons , but rhinestones . I did n't like them and am returning them .	-1
These are pretty , however , they were much thinner than I had hoped . They snagged as I took them out of the package .	-1
These look super cheap the strap always goes side ways and looks funny on . The color does not look good in person . They were also very big and I even got a smaller size . I would not get these if you are looking for quality and cuteness .	-1
they came early , but they were HUGE ! ! ! ! ! i ordered a size 7.5 and i always ear that size . when i put them on , they were soo big on my feet and my feet kept sliding everywhere when i walked ... ... i dont really recommend these . the fabric is really cheap FYI	-1
This one is a nice one , for the first two days . It 's not worth your money if its going to fall apart in the middle of the street while you 're on your way to an interview . : (	-1
Size was far too small , needed atleast one up . Material not too great . Should be 20 bucks tops . not recommended	-1
Plan on going up 2 sizes from what u would normally wear .	-1
This shirt was returned because of size . The quality was good but I disappointed that I had to return it .	-1
The seam inside one of the slippers arrived ripped . I wear a 10.5 and ordered an XL . It fit fine but looked like I was wearing an aircraft carrier : big and clumsy . These slippers were returned .	-1
These fit too big and are n't as comfortable as previously bought mukluk slippers . I would suggest ordered a size down .	-1
Could n't even use these - they were so hard to close , practically impossible . Bummer because I thought they looked really nice .	-1
One of the pairs was broken at my first try to wear them ... yes ... they are cheap , so is the material that they are made from ... .and they are really difficult to close them !	-1
Cheap looking your butt hanging out and your crouch too it 's just not what I was looking for at all I will not order any other	-1
This dress looks like something a stripper would wear . The fabric is some sort of cheap mesh , not good material at all . The top wo n't stay up and the sequins fall off ( just trying it on ) and they are itchy . This dress is just a waste of money .	-1
Yeah right . These size large pants were the same size as a small or medium would be , and I know that even in mediums , pants like these always fit me comfortably . This is not the case with these tight , uncomfortable AND way too short pants . Pants like these are supposed to be long & these did n't even go past my ankle . They 're really crappy pants .	-1
The material was cheap and they ran small . The picture is better ! The large would fit better on a small person .	-1
Generally speaking I like the style ... They fit a little smaller than I expected , but I MIGHT have kept them if it were just for the size . Unfortunately , they are also ridiculously long . I 'm 5'5 & # 34 ; with long legs - occasionally talls fit better than regular lengths , but these were several inches too long . I have some high heels , but one high enough to get these off the ground and I rarely wear heels anymore , so they 're going back .	-1
2/5 stars cause the shipping was fast and material is nice . Horrible red color , not flattering ! I have these pants in black , love them . Buyer beware , really wide legged !	-1
I wanted a fun pair of pants to wear with cropped top , maybe for dancing , or beachy wear , or just a night out . However , these pants were not it . Here 's what I can tell you about them : They are cut short , and I 'm not even a particularly tall women ( avg ht ) . Plus the way the tie & waistband are built in to the pants is weird ( sort of like the top of the pants are unfinished and the leftover fabric becomes the tie in front ) . A very cheap cut of pant is my summary on these !	-1
The reviews comment on the length of these , some too short , some too long , and the pair I got is definitely in the & # 34 ; too long & # 34 ; category for someone who is 5'2 & # 34 ; tall , even when ordering a small . And you ca n't wrap the waist up to accommodate it , because of the thick tie in front.Do n't buy these unless you want to take scissors to them .	-1
Thought this was amazingly cute for my son . I actually ordered this while in the hospital after giving birth . It did take a while to arrive . The blue s*** & pants were adorable ! The yellow one has the saying I love my auntie on the back . Wasnt a wear of that when ordering . He never has worn the yellow one . But as I said the blue s*** & pants were just to cute !	-1
This is not the real deal shemagh . It 's ok , maybe for a child . I thought it was a bit cheap but I bought it anyway . It 's to long enough or big enough however you want to say it . And the fabric feels too thin . It 'd be good for a Halloween costume , but out in the fields or on patrol , I have a different shemagh that is my go to wrap .	-1
Delivery was fine , but definitely runs small and since I am 5'8 , they dont even touch my ankles . I shouldve seen it coming for the reviews it got , but I guess this is a lesson learned from being cheap .	-1
this product is average . not that bad , but it is n't that great either ... i dont know its not really high waited either . : /	-1
Not good quality for the fabric . Does not look good for curvy people coz its gon na squiz the fats or curves and makes lines that are odd to see	-1
The print for the dual pistols is not only facing the wrong way , but it completely comes off ! ! Two stars because it came fast and now I have a somewhat decent pair of plain nude tights .	-1
Consider the price . If you want to , you could slip in an extra stitch where each bow meets the collar , otherwise , with minimal wearing , the bow falls apart . Cute , though .	-1
The XL runs very small . The picture shows it loose fitting but it is a stretchy material and fits tight .	-1
This is a really cute shirt . The Giraffe is adorable . However , the sizing is about 3 sizes too small . I could n't even try it on . It is okay for a junior or girl 's large . Listed and advertised as Women . I had to return it for a refund . Vender offered to refund 30 % of price if I just keep it and maybe give it to someone it would fit ! Honest , I could n't make that up - I have the e-mail ! Wo n't buy from this vendor again .	-1
Very bright , well made , nice material but it is too small and looks awkward , was a gift that just did not work : (	-1
Really really short ! It 's useless to me . I wish I would have looked at length instead of just judging it by the given picture which is severely misleading !	-1
I chose this ring because it looked cool in the ad . But when I received it I was surprised that it was so small and thin , I would not buy this again or recommend it .	-1
stocking is not the proper word to describe this product they are unarguably tights . they are thin enough to see through and way too long i had to fold them over quite a bit , but im rather short so maybe if you 're a taller person they will be more to your liking .	-1
Bought these hoping they would be a good basic go to thong . Wrong , they are sloppy and wide . Like I said very unfeminine . Will probably give to good will . If I could give no stars I would .	-1
As I slid these babies out of the envelope , the left lens popped out and rolled under the coffee table , if that tells you anything about how they & # 8217 ; re made . It took maybe two minutes to pop the lens back into the frame , but those two minutes intimately handling the frame told me more than I wanted to know : it feels brittle . Though the bows feel like soft metal , maybe aluminum or tin , the plastic lens frame creaked disconcertingly under my fingers.The gold-look spray paint that covers most of the structure isn & # 8217 ; t very well done , either . It has bubbles , streaks , a huge thumbprint , one large chip near a seam , and what looks like stray human hairs under the finish . I looked myself in the mirror wearing these , and they don & # 8217 ; t look half bad from a distance , but the minute you get up close , these look unpleasantly cheap . A plastic sticker inside the bows reads : & # 8220 ; Made in China. & # 8221 ; Yeah , we can tell.I admit , I like the wraparound aviator lenses . My regular shades have smaller , John Lennon-ish lenses that can sometimes let light in when I don & # 8217 ; t mean for light to show . There & # 8217 ; s almost no light leak around these lenses , which , with their high UV rating , makes them useful , in addition to their retro kitsch look . But I dislike the color . I wore them outside in full sun , and they turned everything an unpleasant yellow-brown , the color of dead grass or pet stains.Drug stores and gas stations sell shades like these near the checkstand as impulse purchases and gag gifts . My ex has a similar pair in her glove compartment , and pops them on when she has to drive in excessive sun , but leaves them in the car when she gets out . For $ 15 MSRP , they don & # 8217 ; t completely suck . But I probably wouldn & # 8217 ; t wear them anyplace unless I was being self-consciously ironic . I just don & # 8217 ; t trust them that much .	-1
Super cute style . Well made , but runs too small . Classy for work or play . Had to return for a larger size .	-1
The sizes run very large . I got the 1 x because a large does n't usually fit around my bust . So , I already knew I 'd most likely have to take up the sleeves at the very least . But this top turned out to be huge and will have to be completely taken in . I may just return it .	-1
Unless you are a very thin girl then this layered top will do you no favors . The panels just make you look wider in the mid-section than a mid to larger women would prefer . Looks great on the hanger and on smaller size women but not for me !	-1
Ordered an 2X which is what I always order but this is going to the dressmaker to be shaped to fit ? Is shaped and looks like a tent . The material is lovely and soft , and the colours are pretty and true .	-1
I really do n't like this dress . It is not flattering at all . It is also really short . Exactly the wrong length . I wo n't go to the trouble of returning it , but I wo n't be wearing it . It is also too big , I wear a 4/6 and am 5 feet 4 inches .	-1
The lining in the back doesnt line up ! The left back is longer than the right back.You cant tell from the picture , but the back of the dress is longer than the from . Cheaply made as well- cant wear ... what a waste	-1
Very beautiful necklace ... ..VERY POOR QUALITY ... I 'm disappointed that it broke after only one wear ... but it broke while I was n't even wearing it ! It simply broke from being on a necklace hanger . Sucks	-1
I ordered this shirt by size based on reviews of other buyers but to my dismay it was a little tight or should I say not a loose fit like I like in my t-shirts . I was initially going to order three but chose to get one to make sure it was a good fit . Well , I was n't crazy about the fit so I contacted the seller to arrange an exchange for a larger size and all seemed ok until I saw the return authorization was a postage due label . So i contacted them to make sure this was not a mistake and I was told this is the way they do business because they are not as big as amazon ? ? I explained that Items I normally get from amazon and wish to return are usually given a paid return label and they will re-ship the exchange no questions asked . This sellers policy is that you to pay to send it back and then pay again for them to send you the exchange . I do the majority of my shopping on amazon and have never ran across this policy before but Instead of paying all this extra money for a $ 11.00 t-shirt I will gift it to someone who can wear it and not place another with this seller again .	-1
The coat is advertised as light gray but it was actually a dark gray . The jacket was very flimsy and not sized correctly . Amazon was very helpful as always and I returned the jacket for a full refund . In my opinion this jacket is not a good deal .	-1
material very cheap also this outfit looks like pajama 's do n't buy unless you plan to sleep in . also shows all the things you do n't care to share : (	-1
My Niece order this romper and was somewhat disappointed when it came in the mail . Not at all elegant , but for the price she 's keeping it . I want recommend this item .	-1
One size for all ? ? umm not unless you are a size 0 . Got it yesterday was so happy it was ahead of schedule , first of all I am not that big but this is made for someone with no curves at all . Was so tight on my calves was cutting off circulation from the few seconds I had it on , Im only 5 & # 34 ; 4 and the top part would not even come up and cover my chest and it was skin tight from the bottom to the top.Would not recommend if you weigh over 120lbs .	-1
These basically looked like plain black trouser socks . The detail did not show when I tried them on . I was disappointed and sent them back .	-1
It broke in two days loved the look and feel of it but did n't make it : ( very unhappy cause I really liked the ring	-1
I ordered this ring based on other reviews and the picture as well as price . The interlocking bands are very thin . The fit is true to size however the ring does not have fashion value for me .	-1
I had a similar ring and somehow misplaced it so I got this one . It looks just cheap and flimsy . Also runs rather small in size . I ordered for my middle finger but would have to use it on ring finger -- - if I 'd ever decide to wear it at all .	-1
I bought 3 of these all the same very uncomfortabale , turns a dark grey does n't stay shiney at all . Could NOT wear it all day !	-1
There 's only one picture available in this listing . I knew I was taking a chance when I ordered it.The bag is kind of cheaply made ( as I expected , considering the low price of the purse ) .The animal print material on the back of the purse is plastic/rubbery . Not at all what I expected.The front has a fake , thumb-size Gucci logo on it.For the price and quality , I would not buy again .	-1
bag looks great but it never reached me .. : - ( sad but its ok i will check out more bags probly one that can hold my notebook	-1
this is such a beautiful Bag in the picture and in person but is so cheaply made it literally fell apart every time I tried to use it	-1
I 'm a big ZigKick fan and thought these were close enough . I was wrong . The side pattern design is like thin hard plastic making the shoe not very flexible and the mesh is like the cheapest cotton/polyester mix out there ... like everything it touches will snag it . When I tied the shoe the fabric at the bottom of the laces bunched up . It felt like I was walking in hard , airy canoe 's . No support within the shoe from the insole , either . Must have been a new designer 's first day on the job at Reebok when they came up with this one . Returned and ordered me some Kicks	-1
First off these are not running shoes and do not attempt to run in them.Despite the flex looking bottom these shoes are the most motion controlled shoes I have ever put on my feet in 10 or 15 years . The only flex point is at the toes . They are stiff and force your feet to be raised up on the arch side giving the feeling of only having pressure put on the outsides of the foot.There are those that believe in healthy feet muscles , barefoot style running and that arch support is a myth . There are studies of human motion that back this up . I am one such person because I think the foot was designed , either by evolution or divine being , to work properly as is . Artificially holding the arch up only serves to weaken the muscles the foot was designed with causing more foot pain and the need for more arch support . But apparently the designers of these shoes have not seen the studies showing that data . This shoe had the most raised up arch bump I have ever felt . It was only after about 5 seconds of standing in these that the foot pain started.I tried to endure but I didn & # 8217 ; t get past the 3 minute mark with these shoes on and walking around the house . They were so painful with the arch bump poking the muscles and tendons of my arch ( mine are built up and strong from proper running and exercise ) and all my weight was placed on the outsides of my feet.For Reebok shoes I was surprised that they were also a little narrow especially in the toe box . Not too narrow for my foot but just less roomy than real running shoes . Again healthy feet need the toes to spread when running because that is where the push off comes from and the toes spread to & # 8220 ; dig in & # 8221 ; while pushing the body forward.These shoes are not for runners or those with strong feet muscles.For people that insist on high arch support and the toes being kept more stationary this shoe would be a good choice . Also those looking for aggressive motion control need to consider this shoe if their toes can fit into the toe box .	-1
would have been 5 stars if it actually fit . i usually buy 8/10 from this company and it fit , this item didnt fit at all . company gave me a hard time with a refund . cute dress tho	-1
This is super thin and small and looks to be for someone very thin . I got an xxl as it is large us , SO IT SAYS . In reality it is a us small . THIS IS WAY OVER PRICED WITH SHIPPING . I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE ! ! ! ! SO DISAPPOINTING !	-1
Maybe good for the bed room its see threw and very itchy . Maybe its more like a sex outfit then a dress .	-1
this dress is way too small . i saw other people wrote on the reviews that this ran big so i got a medium which is my normal everyday size . this was 2X too small . it is ridiculous how small it is ! ! The sequins were falling off already as I put it on .	-1
The top is beautiful , feminine and very sexy ... that 's the good . The reason for the 1 start is because the top is cut EXTREMELY small . I normally wear a L/XL in tops but I bought a 2X just to be the safe side and it stil did n't fit . I 'm so annoyed because I was certain buying two sizes up would work and it did n't . PLUS , the top does not come down as far on the body as the picture shows . I want to send it back , but not worth the cost of shipping . My suggestion is , if you 're a woman with curves and a bust size larger than C cup , stay away from buying from sellers overseas . Not worth the disappointment : - (	-1
Very small and to think I got a 2xl and im thin too .	-1
So disappointed the sizes are made for stick figures . This was going to be my dream top , but it did n't fit . It was way too small .	-1
im only a size 14 and this items suggests that I need a size 4x . I purchased an xl thinking it would be fine and now im stuck with this product because it cost too much to return the garment back to China , The seller was contacted and they suggested the exchange but want me to pay for the postage .	-1
I ordered a size larger then I wear and it is still too small . It is close , but not quite big enough . It is beautiful though .	-1
Really small stones . It kind of looked fake . Did n't even want to wear them out of the house . The ring was dark that it just looked fake . Do n't waste your money .	-1
So it was so small ... ..I ended up basically throwing it out . The seller split the cost of it with me because it was so expensive to return it . Save your money .	-1
I am 5'2 and the skirt fit me about 2 inches above my ankles . Also I am not sure why , although the pattern is beautiful , the dress was cut in strips and sewn together . Very disappointed .	-1
Hate it . I reminds me of a nightgown . I am 5'8 & # 34 ; and it comes mid calf . I am looking for a little girl to give it to for dress up or maybe she can use it for a nightgown .	-1
Okay , Jessica Simpson shoes usually run entirely true to size , hence my surprise when these were so tight . Also , take everyone 's advice about the buckle . I have no idea why it 's so spastic , but it took me five minutes to buckle one .	-1
Extremely small ! I usually wear a 5.5 . I ordered a 6 to be on the safe side . I should have ordered a size 7 . Order a whole size up ! Beautiful shoes though ... . Now I have to return and no lighting deal and they wo n't exchange them for a bigger size . Ugh ! ! ! !	-1
This shoe is very classic but way too small ... I ordered a 7 my true size and I could barely stick my foot in them , I would order a full size up . These shoes had to go back .	-1
Although it is n't as long as I was hoping for , it did fit really well . After one washing it started to pill , I was disappointed by the quality .	-1
I went a 1/2 smaller , which was fine . These are just too narrow for my feet . Super Cute just wish they fit right . I can still put them on they are just super uncomfortable .	-1
This shirt is made of very rough cheap-feeling fabric , the emblem is not as dark as pictured , and the fit is a bit short . I returned it .	-1
The picture makes this look really cool , unique like hand block printed cotton from India , it 's not - it is cheesy cheap manufactured material that is not natural cotton either : ( too much bother to return just give these to goodwill : ( & # 34 ; ' . ' . '	-1
The material and cut is not what I expected . Very thin faux silk material which does not look as pictured . I am sure someone with smaller breasts could wear this . As another reviewer posted it just looks cheap . Cheaper than the 20 plus dollars it cost . I bought two different colors and styles from the same company and I am going to give them away as gifts instead of keeping them for myself . On the positive side the colors are nice and as pictured .	-1
This is more like cheesy cruise wear than an authentic Indian Kurti . This is n't handblocked and like one other reviewer stated it 's a cheap faux silk . The seller 's sizing is confusing to me and I would have kept it if it fit . But was too tight for my liking . I had quite a few of these saved for later but I do n't think I 'm interested anymore..	-1
The quality is really cheap , they fit horrible , my toes really hurt when i try them on , they look ok but in my feet they really feel wrong	-1
I saw the photo and thought what a great top and in so many great colors.I went to ad the top to my basket but then I saw the shipping fee . OH MY ! ! ! ! That is just ridiculous to charge that much , I will not be buying this top !	-1
This top was very baggy and very thin . I am aware that it IS SUPPOSED to fit baggy but this top was overly baggy and I chose it in a small . Shipping took forever , like 3 weeks . So I would not recommend and I will not purchase from this seller again . Us girls , when you want clothes you NEED it NOW ! Nobody has time to wait 3+ weeks on something not even worth it . Glad I only ended up paying like $ 7 dollars for it but this is a case of & # 34 ; you get what you pay for. & # 34 ;	-1
The shirt looks nothing like it does in the picture . It was massive and see through . However , the seller was helpful and refunded right away . Not a great product but the seller was great .	-1
This is one of the worst made piece of trash ring I have ever purchased . I 've worn it one time , and it has chips all in it . Very light weight trash made ring ! ! ! !	-1
This ring seems cheaply made ... .not good quality . It says in the description that it 's solid titanium but I have my doubts . When I got it it was light , the center color was not bright nor did it seem very well made . The ridges were unpleasant to the touch but It was cheap though , so I ca n't really complain.It 's a man 's ring ... .it serves as a simple ring to wear casually and that 's all.Blessed Be .	-1
Thought this ring would have great shine to it but DEFINATELY NOT the case . This ring is very dull and very disappointing . Did n't cost much . But I literally shop on Amazon every other day . Do n't want to go through the return process so I 'm stuck with it . Eeh	-1
Make sure your order about 2 sizes smaller that you actually are or this will look like you are wearing a tarp . The material is cheap looking as well . I would return but they are making me pay return shipping and its just not worth it ... .but do not order from these people . I have ordered two dresses and they were both HUGE and the material was a real let down !	-1
Chinzy and fell apart all the time . Removed them after having more problems with them then shoe laces . So unless all you do is sit they might be sufficient .	-1
i was very disappointed with this hoodie . i had probably every color of it on my wish list until i received the first one . it 's way too short , in the body and the sleeves . it looks like it would have a more modern fit if you want to call it that but i ended up giving it to my grandmother because she liked it so much . it fits just like all her other shirts do . short .	-1
I ordered this jacket in the lighter blue color ( called Royal I think ) and it came to be in a very dark blue , almost as dark as the navy blue one also offered . This was NOT advertised properly . I needed this for a costume piece and since the color is way off and it comes from the UK , I do n't have time to exchange or return it ... guess I will be spending more time and money scrounging around at stores to find the right color jacket , or just use the totally wrong blue . It 's nowhere near the same color as in the photo . I do NOT reccommend this jacket or company to anyone .	-1
This is a nice coat . I got the purple , which was a bit too bright for my taste , but no big deal . I am between an M and an L for winter coats but I read some reviews that it runs small so I bought XL which floats on me . When trying to exchange it , I discovered I have to pay for the postage back to the UK , which was around $ 32 - more than the price of the coat . Too bad ... .I 'm going to donate it to our local Goodwill store . So this is one thing to keep in mind if you are in-between sizes and may need to return or exchange .	-1
Did n't expect Thick Fleece.I wear a Woman 's sz 10-12 comfortably , but could not button this up over chest . It fit more like a sz8 . Everything I ordered came from China & made it too expensive to return w/ tax & Tarriffs . I ended up keeping at least 3 items ( all Jackets , too short , waistband above my waist at least 2 inches , shorter length than shown , also ) By the time I would have paid each vendor for returns , I would n't have got hardly anything . I was stuck , since they were all on clearance pricing . NEVER will order from China ( not American sizing anywhere & they show short models wearing sz Xl to make everything look longer & looser . I will be giving these away to 12 yr old Grandaughter , or donating for Tax write-off !	-1
This is so huge , I 'm swimming in it . The boatneck plus the large cut make it just unwearable . I kept it because it would cost too much to send back .	-1
I was sent European sizing which is much too big for me . The color is dull looking and the fabric is thin and does not hold shape . I brought three and the only good thing about it was the price excluding shipping . To say the least I am not at all satisfied with this purchase and would not recommend it to no one .	-1
The neck of this top is HUGE ! So are the sleeve cuffs . They just hang , though from the design , I think they 're meant to be tightish.So why is the bottom so tiny ?	-1
I ordered the teal , which in the picture looks light and greenish blue , but when it arrived it was a very royal blue ( dark ) . Not what i expected at all . It pretty much fits as the picture looks but its very thin and it wrinkles very easily . I am a small/medium in tops and the small fit me as expected . it was long and draped down my butt . The material was very thin and not warm at all if u plan on wearing during the winter time .	-1
i really love the concept of this top and was excited to try it . problem is the size was way to big and I looked like i was wearing a trash bag . on me with the bigness , it did n't drape my body as off the shoulder .	-1
I was thinking this would be a long , nice fit shirt to wear with leggings ... it is n't as long as what I would like and it fits in an akward way , the arms are a lot baggier then what it shows , and it just looks akward when you pull it off the shoulder ... Not very happy with it ...	-1
This isnt a true & # 34 ; batwing & # 34 ; top . It kind of fits slouchy , but does n't fall on my shoulders in a flattering way . Also the part of the sleeve around the wrist is awkwardly fitted . The color is waaaaay off . I was expecting a light , wispy rose pink ( based on the picture ) but it was way too bright . The seller is in the UK so paying shipping to return it costs more than what I paid for it !	-1
Poor delivery ... ..I waited for this top for over a month but it finally came .i will not buy from ths company anymore nothing really impressed meMy top s way too large I will give it out as donation because I do n't know how again The whole process will take me.money lost	-1
