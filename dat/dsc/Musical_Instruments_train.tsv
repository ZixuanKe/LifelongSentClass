I 've played the guitar for a number of years , some of them professionally , and during that time I 've owned guitars by Fender , Gibson , Ovation , B.C . Rich , Yamaha and Applause . That said , admittedly , this guitar was purchased with the intention of it being a cheap , expendable guitar that was reasonably playable , that I could take with me when I go camping . While my expectations were n't all that high due to guitar 's price , upon reading other reviews and having experienced Takamine 's quality , I decided to gave this Jasmine a try . I 'm glad I did - what a nice guitar it turned out to be ! Out of the box , the fit and matte finish were impressive . The neck action was nicely set up , the intonation is spot-on and the guitar has a rich sound and tone . The tuning pegs work smoothly and the guitar stays in tune nicely . Note that I changed strings from the set provided to a set of extra-light gauge strings just as a personal preference and that the guitar features a black pick guard not shown in some product photos . The Jasmine S34C NEX is truly an impressive guitar for the price .	1
At one point I had a strong hatred for these strings on my strat , but then I smartened up , worked my calluses to the point where I could probably play 13-62 's tuned to E with no trouble , and realized that these strings worked great for my strat , because of the strong tone that these provide , and ease of bending on the upper frets . These strings also are good for Les Pauls , where the scale length is shorter than the Fender guitars , making bending like velvet .	1
Nice design ... Small , lightweight and very easy to use , dose the job well . I am thinking about getting a 2nd one .	1
This is a great low cost stand that accepts both acoustic and electric guitars . The cradle and neck height are both adjustable enabling a variety of guitar sizes to be used . While it does n't fold up small like a portable stand , it serves well as a semi-portable stand and is very good as a stationary stand .	1
I use this as the first pedal that my guitar cable touches as it goes into the pedal board . It 's true bypass , which means that the sound is not affected when it 's not in use . When you step on the button , the sound cuts out and you get the tuner . It works as advertised . My only complaint is that it could be smaller . There are other smaller true-bypass tuners out there if space is an issue on your board . I 've posted a photo of this tuner on my board -Pedaltrain MINI With Soft Case . If you need a smaller tuner , I have buddies who use and like the polytune .	1
This pedal is great help on stage . It 's fast and accurate , and with polytune & # 34 ; option & # 34 ; you can easily find which string is out of tune .	1
I have limited experience with these types of product , but it does get finger grime off quite well , and does not leave streaks like another guitar-brand name product I also have .	1
I agree with the others - I 've been using Fast Fret for over 20 years ( and Finger Ease spray for over 40 ) , but I believe Slick is a better product . I give it just 4 stars , though , due to its design . The wiping cloth that comes with Slick is meant to fit in a small plastic ziplock bag inside the cap , but it 's difficult to get the cloth back inside the small bag , and it 's bulky inside the cap , making it a little difficult to close with the cloth inside the cap . It would be easier to close if the cap side was deeper ; the way it 's designed now , the cap and the applicator are equally sized , when they need n't be . That 's a small gripe , though - if I could give it 4-1/2 stars ( with half a star off for the design ) , I would - it 's great stuff .	1
So far I really like these . The thickness is about right for me which is sort of a light/medium . The grip is exceptional and they look sort of cool . I got six of them and will probably get more when these wear out . I doubt I will lose them .	1
Genius idea that I wish I thought of first . I actually super glued mine to my work desk to make it permanent , but it has plenty of grip all by itself to securely hold your guitar in place . I would definitely recommend !	1
Good quality rack screws that come with rubber washers to protect face of equipment . Arrived ahead of estimated arrival time which is always nice .	1
Great bargain price . 3 great vocal microphones , in its own protective case , with its own holders . Not top end ... but for general purpose use and abuse ... works just fine . Sensitivity and clarity is more than acceptable for my needs . Feels quite solid .	1
I have bought and used about every banjo strap known to man , the Neotech is by far superior to anything else I have hooked up to my Gibson ESS . The straps are easy to hook and unhook , I have two sets on my banjo , one set for the Neo and another for the harness I use when the back needs a rest . It 's easy to uphook one and hook the other . Well done and I like the bounce feature , softens out the jolts .	1
I have a collection of straps but not a black one . This one matches the acoustic/electric I bought perfectly . The pick holder is a nice addition to the strap that none of my other straps have . I would buy fromthis company again . Thank You .	1
Have been using these for years on my acoustic guitar ... like them and never an issue ... nice bright tone & and last a.good long while .	1
Excellent pedal tuner which is easy to read on light or dark stages and mutes the signal while tuning . Well-designed and rugged construction . I believe that it is a much better value than other major brands which cost at least 50 % more . One-button operation makes it simple to operate .	1
it tunes my ukuleles ! it tunes my guitar ! i can even see how close my voice is to being on pitch ! hooray for this tuner .	1
I 'm very happy with this pedal . It seems to be a knock off of the MXR phase pedal , being that it provides a nice classic , subtle phase effect . You can flip the switch to `` swirl '' for a more pronounced effect , but I love just keeping it mild.The metal switch/button to engage the pedal does n't have the `` click '' that many pedals do . I actually prefer this . The `` click '' effects wear out sooner . Some of my high end pedals also use this smooth , click-less way of engaging a pedal . You 'll know it 's on by the tone change and the bright led light . IMHO , you do n't need a click switch.The sounds are clean and smooth , clear and bright , and all the other adjectives you could use to describe a great phase effect.Quality and Value , all the way .	1
These came on my American Tele in 2004 , and I 've been buying them ever since . Sweet action , durable , and very affordable .	1
These work great ! It 's hard to write a review of strap locks without thinking you are wasting your time . You have a strap . You have a guitar . This locks them together . But , these do work really well . Compared to other brands , I find them easier to use and that is great after a couple of beers . Downside is that the strap is further out from the guitar than is generally considered ( by me ) to be aesthetically pleasing . But , this is true for most strap lock systems . So , I say go for it !	1
I have these on several of my guitars and I love them . Nice and stable , easy to change strings and lock tightly . Always check the diameter of your peg holes prior to installing . To note these have the two peg placement anchors on them , so if your headstock only has the single hole for the tuning peg , you will have to do some drilling . Really nice upgrade for your standard tuners .	1
The software itself ( sound/interface ) : 4.5 starsThe installation and activation : 2 starsPROS:1 ) The drums included in EZ Drummer are the most realistic `` computer drums '' I have ever heard . I 'm using them on my latest song and have gotten nothing but compliments on how they sound.2 ) All sounds are MIDI , which means you can manipulate how you see fit . I use EZ Drummer with MixCraft and have modified pretty much every beat I have used so far with the built-in MIDI editing capabilities.3 ) The interface is clean an easy to use . You just drag a beat from the EZ Drummer window into your DAW.CONS : When I was reading reviews I just thought the people complaining about the install/activation were being wusses . I mean seriously , how hard can it be ? Well , they were right , it sucks . It took me two hours to get it all working.My advice : Do n't even install the app from the included disc . Instead , just go create yourself an account at toontrack.com and download the most up-to-date version and ALL the patches for the modules that come with it.My experience:1 ) Try to install from disc . Fails with a 1308.2 ) Google 'd the problem . Found out I needed to get a toontrack.com account and download the installer from there.3 ) Downloaded the ~650 MB ZIPPED installer . Then , I had to unzip the 18,000 files , which took about 20 minutes on my PC.4 ) I was finally able to install it and then had to download three other updates to the modules within the install.5 ) Then I had to jump through one final hoop to active it ( take this key copy it here , then copy this here , stand on your head , etc.. ) .Great software , horrible install.~Slick	1
I use these cables in my home , hooked up from my audio interface to my monitors . They appear to be very well built and sound just fine . I have had them for several months and they are working perfectly . Highly recommended for the price .	1
It 's a great string winder , and it is so nice being able to wind and cut the string with the same tool . It 's a brilliant idea haha . It 's very good quality , like all planet waves products .	1
These cables give you a pure sound unhindered and uncut . I have several other `` good '' cables but when compared to this they cut highs and even the level . I have grown as a musician to the point that I Know it 's worth it to pay a little more for these quality cables . Yes you can get many cables way cheaper ( and I 'm all for getting things at a good price - publishers clearing house has Not visited me yet ! ) but this is a case of you get what you pay for !	1
Item arrived as described and on time - Way larger than expected , but my son loved it ! Says it 's easier to use than the smaller cloths we 've gotten before .	1
Good picks , great feel and brings out sound loudly . Mostly for Electrics . I prefer the lighter sound of the Acoustic but these work very well with my friends Electric , Fender .	1
I got this for $ 150 dollars when it was on sale . I do n't like 8 inch speakers for gigging , but it has unbelievably good sound when going from the line out into a PA . The 8 inch speaker is okay for practice , and it has a jack for an external cabinet . Be careful with the load you put on your amp though .	1
Awesome pedal , I love the joyo pedals , they do n't break the bank and sound awesome . Glad I bought this pedal	1
Gives a nice warped slightly detuned effect to your first at the right settings . ( Think Alice in chains , or REALLY distorted live nirvana solo ) admittedly not everyone 's into the whole grunge tone . But it was what I was looking for.Has some nice shimmers and thickening on other settings too.And hey , you can pretty much get it for pocket change .	1
I have played , listened to , and used audio amps for over 4 decades , and while I have n't owned every name brand amp on the planet , I do know my way around them well enough to spot a good deal when I see one . This is a nice little practice amp for electrified acoustic guitar , with an input for a mic ( XLR - no phantom power ) and a CD player or other audio source . It also has a headphone output ( 1/4 inch ) . It has three tone controls and separate volume for the guitar and mic inputs.I got this originally for my mother , who used to sing in an Andrews Sisters-type group back in the day . She still loves to sing , and wanted a small amp and mic to practice and do the occasional small jam . She has n't had the opportunity to do that yet , but I have tested the amp and put it through its paces . I think it will work fine for the kind of thing she has in mind . The lack of reverb or processing for the mic is a bit of a drawback , but considering what I paid for it , I ca n't complain.Now , this is not a gigging amp , at least not in my opinion ( your mileage may vary ) . It is small , solid state , with an 8 inch speaker , and 15 watts of power ( I have n't measured the exact output , so I 'm taking Behringer 's word on that ) . I like Behringer , and they can turn out some pretty good gear , within its limits.I like the sound of the amp with my Carvin acoustic guitar with a Fishman preamp . It is an inexpensive practice amp , so I do n't expect the same kind of quality I would from a more serious combo amp . The 8 inch speaker is obviously not going to give the kind of sound quality as a good 12 inch , no matter what . The question is , does this amp provide the sonic quality and flexibility needed to allow serious practice work , composition , or just moderate entertainment value ? For me , that answer is a clear `` yes . `` However , this is an inexpensive practice amp , and if you approach it with that attitude , I think you will find it a nice little amp . Do n't plan on using it for your next tour with Manhattan Transfer , Seal , or Celine Dion .	1
I have owned several of these over the years and own a silver colored one presently . The price is right for these , and they work just fine . My only real issue is that sometimes , they will bunch or bend strings when setting them on whatever fret you 're going to bar , thus producing a sound you were n't looking for . Some of the higher end capo 's counter this by having screws and such rather than a spring . However , like i say , these work fine with a little care and attention to their placement on your fretboard , and are from what i can tell , the most popular model on the market .	1
The joyo tremolo is awesome , best for the buck . It 's just as good as any , I love the joyo pedals . affordable and does n't break the bank	1
I did not think a pedal under 40 bucks could sound this good . It does . You have to try it to believe it . I do n't like the demonic face on the front though , so I knocked off a star . Otherwise it would be an easy 5 stars .	1
I agree with those reviewers who really like this pickup . It has a very natural sound , is reliable and amazingly strong . The suction cup issue is easy to solve , it just needs to be a bit humid and it will stay well . I also bought ( for comparison ) the Cherub WCP-60G , which is not bad but has much more of an unnatural metallic sound , plus it seems more feedback-prone than the AXL . I can only recommend , if you have a nice classical guitar and want to amplify it with true sound , the AXL is an excellent and inexpensive solution . I doubt that the $ 200 stuff is much better .	1
I 've been a Jazz III fan since 1997 starting with the red ( too buttery and rounded sounding ) and then moving to the black ( durable but a bit tubby sounding ) . Eventually I tried a 1.0mm Tortex of this pick which had good attack but was somewhat mushy sounding through amp sims.But then I tried this .60mm and holy cow the sound change was like getting new pick ups . More mids , more attack , faster attack , scratchier attack , and less lows . Now you 'd think this would make your guitar sound thin , and indeed it sounds thinner but also clearer by a factor of two.Thus when recording through amp sims , you get a clearer more dynamic more attack-ish sound . When using the 1.0mm the fundamental was a bit too strong which made for a mushy amp sim sound , but this .60mm did the trick . It just sounds heavier , tighter , and more articulate . While it does wear faster , for recording purposes it 's my current ultimate pick of choice.So if your guitar does n't sound clear , articulate , or aggressive enough first give this pack of picks a shot . But you do n't have to take my word for it ... da-nehh-nan !	1
I use these in standard tuning on my prs mccarty . The sound is unbelievable . Thick and creamy sound . Lasts slmost 3 weeks before the tone dies . Good price . Good strings .	1
This is a great deal for two microphone stands . They are well constructed and are very flexible ; can be used with an instrument or just as an ordinary microphone stand . Several adjustment areas allow the perfect height/positioning . These should last a long time as long as they 're not abused .	1
After reading all of the reviews here and around the Internet , I took a chance since this is my first professional-level microphone . I 'm glad I did because it 's really great.One thing you will need , though , is a phantom power unit . I wish I could remember which one I got here on Amazon ( I think it was about $ 25- $ 35 ) but it worked great . Excellent sound quality , much better than any other mic I 've used .	1
I 've been using this product for a while now . Only for indoor really light use . So I ca n't speak to it 's durability at this time . But I like it because it 's cheap , light , and it works .	1
Good stitching , no slippage . Awesome strap . Fits straps locks just fine . Perfectly happy with this strap . Thank you earnie ball !	1
If you want to breathe new life into an old guitar for about $ 20 , then this kit is for you ! Changing your pickguard and hardware is a great way to give your guitar some personality and help you stand out from the pack .	1
Hey , it gets the job done and that 's all I can ask for . I tried several `` cheapo '' pedals , and this one was my favorite of them all . While some had better casings ( metal instead of plastic ) , at the end of the day I 'm looking for a good sound , not a pretty pedal board . The pedal seems solid enough , it does n't take up much space , it sounds great , and it has a versatile range of sounds as far as tremolo pedals come.AND , if you are like the typical musician , you are looking for something that 's not going to break the bank .	1
I do n't believe there is such a thing as a perfect capo , but this one is quite good . For those with reasonably strong hands it is pretty easy to use . It does a very good job of compressing the strings to the frets and is definitely well built . It is as with all capos , important to take it off when not in use so the `` rubber '' does not get grooved . This is just good common sense . If this lasts a couple of years I will definitely purchase another .	1
I 've been using Finger Ease for years and always will on my acoustic and electric guitars . It has multiple uses : -Cleans off residual oils and buildup from your hands , extending the life and tone of your strings-Lubricates strings and neck for faster and smoother playability , though this effect does typically wear off after an hour or so-Works decently well as a polishing agent to rub off finger prints , etc . from the top , sides , and back , will not harm most finishes ( as far as I know ) I usually just apply it before playing but using it after could definitely be beneficial as well.I did read that the compound is conductive and should be kept off of your pickups to avoid interference . I 'm not sure if this is true as I 've never noticed any problem when the spray gets on my humbuckers . However , I typically try to keep it off of electronic components in general just out of common sense.For under ten bucks , the can will last you awhile . Just order a few at a time and find free shipping , you 'll find yourself wanting one in each guitar case all the time .	1
Wanted to buy a better stand than the cheap metal folding one that I 'd had in high school . This was a great compromise between portability/storage and sturdiness . I did want collapsible legs , which this has , and the solid coated metal shelf is wonderful after my old metal folding stand . Works well with the Manhasset second shelf accessory , and has been in constant use for months now . I 've had absolutely no problems with it . The height is easily adjustable , and the shelf tilt is easy too . Am very happy with what I got for the price I paid !	1
I have purchased six of these over the last couple years . Why ? Because they work . They mount securely into the drywall and lock the guitar into place . I do n't think I 'd ever buy any other device to hang a guitar on my wall . They feel rock-solid too.I highly recommend and will be buying more in the future.I gave it 4/5 stars because I have n't used any other devices like these before - maybe there is something better , but I have n't seen it yet.~Slick	1
Its much better than what I got with my violin . Its been good I ca n't really complain , considering its basically tree sap .	1
the product is great . a lot of nice features . i am running it through a little Cube amp to practice withand it is not the kind of amp you want to use . best results are going to be with an amp that allows you toloop through another available channel and bypass any effects you have on the amp like distortion . if you havethe amp overdriven , then the loop comes out that way too , and the byproduct of that as well on a smaller less capableamp is noise cancellation.Trying to solo over a rhythm part for instance cancels out the signal being sent from the pedal through the speakerand clobbers what you 're trying to play over.Great pedal , but have a good amp with multiple inputs to put it through .	1
This is definately worth the money . I was looking for a metronome and got this awesome unit that does it all . Bought another one for my friend !	1
I 've been using D'Addario XL strings since the 80s . I love 'em . The 10 pack price is amazing .	1
Cool tuner , I have this on my pedal board and it works really well , very easy to seeand is true bypass which is nice when it is n't on ... .	1
This little amp kicks major ass , dood . I think I may have blown the speaker or it 's just how it sounds but it 's great for a lo-fi kind of fuzz-e tone when the gain and levels are all the way up . The clean tone is really nice too , a little to bright for my taste , but for a mini-clip amp it 's not too bad . I can take this plus my tele to my friends house and sit outside and just didtle away . Theres a headphon jack , a 9v power supply and that 's in for plug ins , No line in so you ca n't plug you ipod or whatever to it and play along but oh well . If you have a big rig and you just want something small for like a camping trip with some friends this is pretty great .	1
Shipped in time . Did n't test microphones yet , but I think this is best price for 7 microphones . According to the rewievs the sound quality should be quite well . I 'll check it later .	1
It 's always been a problem trying to keep the Desk microphone in one place . Promblem resolved , by purchasing this stand my heavy Shure57 stays in one place . The only thing is I wish the flex was a little longer , about three inches would be great . But otherwise a wise and good purchase .	1
Now-a-days I just search amazon because they have always got what I want at reasonable prices . This is no exception . I am not a musican but wanted a case to carry my Epiphone Les Paul Custom Pro to the guitar guy for setup etc . This was was better then I expected . It is sturdy outside and nice fusion inside with a tight but not too tight fit . In other words great all around . I know it sits on a self with many other guitars when I take it in to the guitar guys so I am perfectly confident that it is well protected . and it is lockable ( with key ) If you are looking for a more then good case for your Epi LP just get this one . You will not be disappointed.Also . I ordered it on a tuesday and it came the next day . No special shipping . Maybe it is my locations but that was great too . Well packed .	1
This microphone is the best microphone I have ever owned . It is very dense , a little quiet , but the sound is absolutely brilliant quality . It is very clear sounding , and very well built . Get this mic . You will not regret it .	1
I have been using D'adario strings for 30 years . They sound great . They stay in tune . Excellent sustain . I can get better string control compared to other strings . I have never experienced a string break in 30 years .	1
My always on pedal . This pedal 's amazing . You really should try it yourself to understand . I 'm using a Fender Jaguar , this thing is married to it . I 'm serious , try it before you die !	1
excellent	1
I just bought a Rickenbacker 4003 that came with Schaller strap locks pre-installed . I 've used Dunlops before , but those would require redrilling the holes to put them on the bass , so I just bought the Schaller buttons . I do n't quite like their look as well as the large round Dunlops , but there 's no question about the quality -- these are not going to fall off the bass anytime soon .	1
for only a few bucks , this little item is extremely convenient ! ! ! i placed it on a filing cabinet , next to where I practice and filled it up ... .love love love the hastle-free access to my picks ! ! ! thanks guys for the great little product ! : ) all smiles ...	1
This is a really nice music stand . I was n't expecting it to be such high quality . I wanted something better than those cheap metal music stands that would get knocked over by a small breeze of wind . Definitely got what I wanted . The orange Gearlux logo looks pretty cool too . Buy it .	1
What can I say ... .for the price , this is the best tuner out there right now ! So nice not having to step on a tuning pedal in order to tune while I 'm gigging onstage . I just cut the volume on my guitar ( Snark senses vibrations through the neck ... so no sound needed ! ) and I 'm done ! Tap tempo works great too if you need to know the tempo of a song ! Just another awesome bonus : )	1
I love this little device : The colors of the display are a nice touch ( red on the left hand side and green on the right ) .The color of the device.The interface is great and the clip works well.It 's very accurate and I love how its chromatic function and the fact that it has a very large letter for the chord ( versus being hard to read ) .A very attractive price . I bought two . It would be easy to have one for travelling purposes and to leave one at home just in case you lose it . And it 's so cheap , it would n't matter if you lost it .	1
These seem to be quite well constructed electric guitar strings which I will appreciate for a long while . Rock On !	1
I do n't know much about guitar tuners , but I am sure you can pay for a more expensive one , but this one does the job . It was not hard to figure out how to use it , and the Fender is a happier guitar for it .	1
When I bought these I was looking for pop filters to use with a pair of condenser microphones to help keep the wind pops from ruining a recording . Once these are in position they work just fine , the problem is that getting them into position can be harder than it looks . The device clamps onto a microphone stand and then you adjust the goose neck to get the filter where you need it . The filter and the goose neck are fairly heavy and as such it was often a struggle to get the filter where I wanted it and to keep it there.On the plus side , the device looks nice and professional and it has held up over three years of use .	1
These cables are sturdy and sound clean . Using cheaply made cables could affect your sound - you can loose top end . I use Monster on all my mics ( XLR ) and all my instrument cables ( 1/4 ) with no issues . Great product ... Highly recommended .	1
I have played guitar/bass for quite some time and have used numerous tuners ranging those those big Korg strobe tuners to my latest Sabine STX-1100 . I liked the big Boss TU-1000 but that is overkill unless in certain situations.I was at a big jam in a nightclub around Christmas and saw a bunch of guys using clamp on tuners of varying brands and thought I would try one . I looked at the Amazon offerings and after reading reviews settled on this one over the SN1 or SN2.This is too easy and my guitar has never stayed in tune like this before . It requires no input from your guitar so can be used any time . The only thing I do n't like about it is it does n't really like the E string of my bass . I do n't think it picks up those long wavelengths so well . I will try the SN8 shortly and give this one to a friend.I do recommend this for guitarists because you will always be in tune no matter the tuning . If you leave it on while soloing you can see what notes you are playing . I am my own guitar tech , as well as for a friend , and I can set the intonation perfectly with this thing.Get a Snark and you will be happy.Edit - I do n't like to use this with my PRS as the headstock has very little room to clip this to . The only place to clip is the very end and you are fighting tuning keys for space at that point . If you can get it there comfortably it works but nothing like with a Fender or Gibson ; both which have plenty of space on the headstock .	1
These are as described - these work with fender switches ( which , turns out they include those screws ) , and fender pickups . Used them while building a few pre-wired pick guards .	1
These Dava picks are very nice . They are about the equivalent of a medium weight pick.The rubber grip area is great . The feel is soft , just perfect for holding a long time . The Dunlop picks with the bumps are nice , but this just feels a lot better between my fingers.There are three little lines at the center of the pick , the bottom line is supposed to be less flex and the top line is supposed to have more flex . This is really hard to position my fingers on exactly the spots and there is n't much of an effect no matter where I place my fingers . The effect is subtle at best.The only criticism is the tip is a little bit too short ; the rubber can end up striking the string.Overall , I like these picks a lot . The colors are cool and the rubber feels really good in my hand .	1
Standard great quality from Planet Waves/D'addario but these certainly can change price very frequently throughout the year . I think it almost doubled in price a week after I ordered ... not sure why .	1
This tuner tunes my guitars very well , it tunes them perfectly , and works well tuning bass guitar , very easy to use , very visible screen when tuning , clamps on nicely , and the red color is very beautiful you could say , all in all very good tuner .	1
I have a Fender Stratocaster MIM with standard white pickguard , which I changed by a black one . Then I decided also change others white pieces , and this Fender Accessory Kit fit perfect in my guitar . I did n't need no adaptation to install it on guitar .	1
you really have to have a lot of wind inside you to play these harmonicas , they are great but you really got to blow hard to get them rocking , adding distortion to them helps to brings out a better sound live or in the studio . These fit my budget and plus you get EVERY KEY you need for any song ... ... WOW ... Hohner has been around forever , well constructed instrument and very reliable company .	1
These strings are the best . Have n't found any others that sound and feel so good . They lasted 3 years and I play nearly every day for hours . Go figure ! I actually thought I did n't need to change strings ( still do n't know for sure ) because they still sounded so good and show no wear . Anyway I decided to change the strings because it 's been so long . Happy that I did however .	1
Fender Accessories 073-3150-406 Pure Nickel Electric Guitar Strings , Custom are very good ! I got it for my Strat guitar and they sound much better then Ernie Ball or D'Addario ( at least on my taste ) .Recommend it .	1
well made , works like a charm and felt like it was made with quality material and not made of cheap parts and plastic .	1
Good strings for the price , nice ring to them . So far they seem to last and were a bit louder than my last strings although they were flat round and did expect them to be very loud .	1
This is a simple , straight forward and worthy replacement mic clip for the standard Shure SM57/58 type mic . Well made , reasonably priced as with most On Stage stuff .	1
What really can you say about Switchcraft , they just make good solid parts . Grab one , drop it in and replace that old broken import jack .	1
I 've got a bunch of these little tuners- I keep one with each instrument . They are a little tough on batteries , but they are accurate , even picking up notes below E on my double bass C extension.Highly recommend !	1
this cable is awesome thick cord really high quality jacks highly recommend this better then any plastic coated cable I do n't have problems with it tangling like I saw on one review	1
If you like Jazz Guitar picks and if you like Tortex picks this is the perfect marriage . These are the best . Enjoy .	1
This pedal lives up to the hype . Distortion-wise , it delivers something in between a tubescreamer type OD and a full on distortion ( like a Crunchbox or Rat ) . I checked out several Youtube demonstrations before I took the plunge on this one . I think the tone is actually much better in person than it appeared in the videos - more transparent and organic sounding . I have owned the Fulltone OCD in the past and this pedal is nearly identical sounding if my memory serves me correctly . I also own a V1 Dano Cool Cat OD - which is an excellent OCD-ish pedal- but this one is getting more action these days . I am running this into the front of either a Palomino V32 or a Jet City 20 watt combo with the amps set up just on the verge of breakup . The pedal also plays well with others- I am getting nice lead tones by running a TS type of OD into the front of this one . The JF-02 is a really nice dirtbox - and not just for the price . The fact that you can own it for 40 clams or less makes it a no-brainer for those of you who ( like myself ) are addicted to dirtboxes . I have noticed some price gouging with a few vendors on here . Shop around . I knew the build quality was decent because I own the Joyo Vintage Overdrive and they are both built like bricks .	1
Came on time . Works Very good . Strong spring that good start . If needed I would buy another . For me and my son it works great .	1
I got the $ 50 standard black on black case . The case arrived within 2 days via UPS during the middle of the Christmas rush ! Wow ! Very fast shipping and it was adequately packaged and there was no sign of the box being abused in anyway . Regarding the item itself , I am bit lukewarm . I have a $ 500 Washburn and wanted something more than a gig bag for going to and from gigs and practice sessions . And I got that . Its lightweight , plenty of room in the gear box and on top of the guitar head . However , the fit is a bit loose and I do n't have the sense that this case will stand up to much abuse over time . So if you have a pricey guitar or are planning to load you guitar in a truck with other gear , or might ship your guitar or take it on a plane , this case is not the one you want to buy .	1
great set of strings I will stick with elixir strings whether it be electric or acoustic great brand and they know what they are doing .	1
Holds my guitars just fine . It is a bit odd to think that something off balance ( one of the legs is shorter then the others ) will be fine but it works .	1
The tuners I have for my guitar/banjo have modes for use as a metronome . The problem is to use them as a metronome you have to push a small multifunction button to switch to metronome function , then press smaller buttons to set the speed of the metronome . I find them annoying.This metronome can be set with one hand by simply turning it on and twisting a dial . The speed is easy to read and setting the loudness of the metronome clicks is easily changed . And there are two clicks to choose from . The metronome has a flashing light too.Overall a very useable metronome.5 stars .	1
This stand is great ! It is solid , but light weight enought to move as needed . The footprint is small & meets are needs well .	1
These strings are Great ! They Last for a real long time . They even include free picks which is so cool . I Defiantly recommend them for everybody else ! ! !	1
I normally use Dunlop & # 8217 ; s 0.60mm nylon picks , but decided to give the 0.60mm Max-Grips a try , when the price dropped to $ 3.00 for a dozen.The top half of the Max-Grips have a special surface with tiny ridges , that gently bite into the skin to provide a nice secure grip . The feeling is a little strange at first , but you should get used to it quickly.I like the feel and playability of the 0.60mm Max Grip & # 8217 ; s , but they are little more flexible than I prefer , so if I were to get another set , I would get a thicker type , either0.73mmor0.88mm .	1
I needed an EQ pedal since my current amp has no way of adjusting it 's EQ . Most distortion pedals I plugged into it ended up sounding way to & # 34 ; bassy & # 34 ; , and so I bought this in hopes that it would help clear that up a little . I really did n't expect much since this pedal was so cheap ; and for a brand new one at that ; I was completely surprised that this worked and also helped improve the overall sound by fiddling with each band adding a nice richness to the overall mids . If you 're looking for a cheap way to dial in your tone for your guitar , I 'd recommend this .	1
To start , as the full name of this pedal would indicate , this pedal is for tube amps . I ca n't comment on how it 'll sound for a hybrid , and my experience is that it 's definitely not for solid state . Distortion pedals go much better with solid state . Further , tube screamers are n't meant to take your tube amp from clean to high gain ; again , that 's what a distortion pedal will do . Tube screamers in general are designed to drive your tubes a little harder , and are most commonly used as a solo boost . Tube screamers are in the category of `` overdrive '' pedals , and like the name would indicate , they 're meant add a little extra `` over '' an already `` driven '' amp , but in a more natural , smooth , organic way then a distortion pedal would.HOWEVER , the Ibanez TS-9dx does more than your typical tube screamer . The extra knob that switches between ts9 , + , hot , and turbo mode adds a whole lot of tone and use options . Let me expound : I play hard rock and metal through a Bugera 1990 head ( basically a Marshall JCM 900 ) and cab with celestion vintage 30 speakers . While that amp does have a fair amount of gain and bass on tap , it 's not quite enough to accurately get more modern tones unaided . A standard Ibanez TS-9 or some other knock-off tube screamer will not be able to get an amp like mine into more modern , heavier tones , because standard tube screamers also slightly cut bass and add some mids , again , to help solos cut through the mix . But the extra knob on the ibanez ts9dx solves this problem . By switching to + , hot , or turbo mode , the pedal adds bass and a little extra gain incrementally . I like the `` + '' setting the best . So the way I use this pedal is that I 'll set my amp for my standard crunchy rhythm tone with the gain on the amp already fairly high . Then , for the songs that utilize a little heavier sound , I 'll kick on my ts9dx , with the drive pretty low ( 9 o'clock ) , volume at 12 o'clock , tone about 1 o'clock , and + mode . With these settings it increases the bass and general thickness of my tone , and adds a little gain and volume . So it 's basically like adding another channel to my amp.I will add one detail that might make or break this pedal for you : tubescreamers in general , and certainly this Ibanez ts-9dx , add mid-range to your tone automatically . And you ca n't dial it out . The regular ts-9 mode adds some low mids , and a little more high mids . The other modes add more low mids in particular , which in part contribute to the overall `` thickness '' to the tone , which can be great . But if you 're after a scooped mid sound , say for metal , then I would only recommend this pedal as a solo boost , where the mids will help cut through the mix.In conclusion , it 's probably safe to say that most people who buy tubescreamers are probably playing blues of some sort and are just looking to boost their volume and maybe add a little dirt . And yes , this pedal will do that . So will the BBE greenscreamer , behringer tube overdrive , mxr distortion plus , Boss SD-1 , digitech bad monkey , or several other ibanez tube screamer pedal variations . But by adding the turbo-mode options , the Ibanez TS-9dx will work for the hard rock and metal players ( depending on the exact style ) in a way that these plethora of other options wo n't .	1
Really great sounding harmonica . Beautiful sound and very well made ! Very happy with this product and the price is incredible !	1
This capo is small , looks good , and works very well . It is well protected to not scratch or nick your guitar .	1
For the price , ca n't beat it . Works as well as any $ 15 - $ 20 one I would have bought at local guitar stores .	1
I mean you paid 15 $ for a pedal that if you want to buy from the BOSS it 's about 6times this price and if you want it behringer it 's about twice this price . It does what is supposed to and it does n't have a cheap look . For home and garage entertainment is good enough . I was trying this pedal before i buy any other pedal from the same brand , but now that i know that i like it i 'm going to buy the distortion ( red ) one . i 'm only sad they do n't make a noise gate or something similar . That would be the top of the deal .	1
I 'm using this pedal like a clean boost for leads , and I 'm very happy with it 's sound . Uncolored +20db of clean gain ...	1
this is an amazing acoustic amp for my classical guitar . i use this to play in the Church and a friend of mine approached me and said that the sound is really crisp and bold . i was happy .	1
This is hands down the most comfortable strap I own . I am pretty sure it is really a bass strap but I use it on my electric guitars and it is superbly comfortable . Not cheap but keep looking to see if there is a sale or a demo model . Worth the wait .	1
I 'm using four of these for Podcasting - they seem just a tiny bit flimsy but for my purposes where they will be gently used I am completely happy .	1
Sound 95 % like the boss mt-2 just not as clear as boss pedal . Sounds like it belongs to 80 's trash metal did n't really do me to good with modern death or thrash metal	1
It is a good pedal . It is not heavy and the price is good . It is a good choice for a beginner . Thank you .	1
This was recommended to me by the top engineer at Genz-Benz bass amplification company . Andy said that this product is far superior to any other . He was right . Fixed the scratchy potentiometer on my Shuttle 6.0 amp . Also fixed the effects loop jacks , which had become oxidized and were causing my amp to intermittently lose 90 % of its power on gigs . Not good ! After several gigs worth of testing , both problems are resolved ! Andy said that this product actually works better over time once it has been applied since it has a lubricating , cleaning and coating effect on the components . Wow ! And no , Andy does not own stock in , have affiliation with , or represent in any way the manufacturers of De-Oxit . Nor do I .	1
I figured I would splurge and buy these just to have some backup cables when I wear out the cheap guitar center ones ( and have some that match ) . They are well built and feel like they can take some abuse . I will probably but 2 more packs shortly to switch out all my cables .	1
I plugged in the amp , and I plugged in the bass , and there were no issues with the wire . This is one of those products you do n't want to overly notice , and in that it has done the job is is designed for .	1
The strap is adjustable on both ends , and the front adjustment slider sat right on my shoulder . I cut it off and glued the material back together with Shoe-Goo , and now it 's great . Padding and wide material make standing with a heavy bass a whole lot less tiring .	1
it does what 's it 's suppose to do ... holds a mic , pretty much what you see is what you get ... works very well .	1
I love these picks . Medium is the perfect size for me , as well as the majority of people . This is a great looking pic and you get 12 of them at such a great price . I would n't buy anything else .	1
This is a lemon oil used for cleaning and conditioning the rosewood fingerboards of guitars . This only gets done once a year on the average guitar , so if you 're like me , this one bottle will supply you for many lifetimes . Other than that , it is what it is and does what it says . The applicator contains a dispensing valve so push down hard to open it when you want the oil to flow.The label says NOT to use this product on maple fingerboards . Does n't say why , but my guess is it will discolor them , so be forewarned .	1
This stand is useful for small instruments..fits my tenor uke and violin just fine . Any bigger than that , and the piece that holds the neck becomes too small ( like a baby martin guitar ) , etc . Hope this helps	1
This product is worth having if , like me , you find yourself needing a place to quickly `` park '' your guitar without putting it back in the guitar stand . I use it on a desk next to my chair and music stand . Works great -- only suggestion I have it to perhaps make a version with a sticky tape underside , or a way of semi-permanently attaching it the spot where you want it so it does n't move around . I wound up using a very small wood screw to attach it to my desk so it stays fixed . Overall -- I like it .	1
I had no problems at all getting a brand new poly pro strap on these . Even if it was too snug , it would n't have been hard to work a strap on to these . I do n't know why people are saying bad things about this product , If your dealing with guitars there much harder things to do with guitars than getting a snug leather strap onto the locks . Do n't listen to the whiners . These are what they need to be .	1
Padded portion of strap is quite soft and comfortable.Both ends are a loop . You disonnect the quick release buckles and loop ends through banjo head retainer rods . Easy to do , and you can vary locationGood Product - I would from this manufacturer again .	1
Back in the 90 's I used to have an Ampeg guitar head with an effects loop . I discovered the rack version of the BBE in a music store and was amazed by what it did for the money . The amp I have now is a totally bad ass Fryette Deliverance 120 , but sadly it has no effects loop . So I thought I was out of luck as far as a BBE goes , because as far as I knew they were only available in rack mount units that could not be placed anywhere but in the effects loop . Then I was looking for pedals on Amazon and , lo and behold , there was a BBE Sonic Maximizer pedal ! I snatched it up with a quickness and I am very pleased that it sounds just as good as the rack version . One caveat- if your signal is noisy the BBE can actually increase your signal noise . For this reason I highly recommend using top quality patch and instrument cables and doing all you can to clean up any noisy aspects of your sound before you use it . This pedal is very subtle , but to an audiophile like me it is absolutely essential . It also works great for ANY instrument or sound system . It 's also great for vocals as well . But you may want the rack version for those applications . I would also buy the rack version if I had an effects loop to run it through . IMO , the pedal is really only for those folks who have no effects loop but still like what the BBE does . I 'd go with the rack just for ease of use and keeping it in the proper place in the signal chain . Plus you can get a stereo rack version and have two BBE 's for not much more money that you can use for another application .	1
My banjo arrived a couple days after I ordered it . It tuned up very easily , and for me it holds tune nicely . It has a good ring to it . So far I have only had to replace one string , but that was most probably due to inadvertently letting it sit in front of a forced air heating vent .	1
Awesome instrument . It stays in tune and is fun to play . The best $ 29 that I 've spent in a long time . After a week , I 'm already playing songs and I 'm not a string player . Do n't purchase this without buying a tuner . I bought the Snark SN-6 Uku tuner . It 's awesome too .	1
This was so perfect that we bought 2 more of them for our music at home !	1
I have a 5 watt combo amp . I was looking for a smoother sound , and got it in this tube . It lacks the brutal attack of the Sovtek and the all around bright articulate response of the NOS RCA gray plate I tried for over a year , but I 'm really liking this sound for what it is . I think a tube amp ought to be warm and musical , with nice natural compression , and that 's what I 'm getting out of this JJ .	1
This is an amazing guitar . I could n't put it down , I have experience playing really , really expensive guitars . My $ 500 `` beater '' acoustic I was just going to take to the beach and stuff actually got warped and never played well at all , I could n't imagine what I would b getting for $ 90 . By was I wrong . It 's my best acoustic currently ! This thing sounds like , sustains , and holds its ' own tune like a similar $ 2000.00+ Martin model and that 's ZERO exaggeration ! Get it and see , you will be blown away . I bought a second one . I just wish I had found this guitar sooner .	1
Great prce	1
This is the second clip on tuner I have bought . This is much better than the other brand I have . It 's easy to use and see . The colors and the swivel head make this one my favorite . The built in tap metronome is a cool idea . If you 're shopping for a tuner give this a try . At less than $ 13 it 's a fantastic buy	1
I use this for my Epiphone Zakk Wylde Custom Les Paul . It fits perfectly in the case , one of the best cases I own and have seen , the carpet is awesome , also has a pocket in the middle , what holds the neck up , and can fit a strap and even a pedal . Very durable case and seems like the younger brother of the more expensive Gibson case .	1
I tried these strings on my Zager guitar . the are certainly ok and play fine . they are nothing far and above the original strings provided thru Zager . just a little cheaper in cost perhaps . maybe they will last longer . I had some problem with my original strings as the high strings started to rust in the case due to the humidity I put in there for the guitar wood ( I live in hot and very dry Arizona ) . these have not rusted , so far .	1
The regen control goes to very strong deep levels that will rumble the floor at the lower end ( My fender excelsior with it 's 15 inch speaker rattled the walls ) of its sweep and can give a very cool effect . I notice very little tone suck with the pedal bypassed . Also , the speed know has a great range with 5+ second sweeps to super fast leslie and univibe like tones . The depth knob does it 's job . It does n't have a manual knob to move the sweep , but I leave the depth all the way up most of the time so it 's no big deal . For the price , this was perfect for trying out a discreet flanger pedal instead of the one built into my Vox modeling amp .	1
this is perfect for playing rockabilly or country music.the case is made of plastic but seems sturdy as long as you dont stomp on it too hard . but for 20 dollars its well worth the price . this is a great product and i highly recomend it .	1
Works well with my PC notebook and my MacBook Pro . Sounds good . Amazing for the price . Good buy . Can 'd go wrong .	1
My new guitar had only the back strap connector.You can put out over $ 20 for a button strap holder but for under 5 bucks I decided on this.Attach short end to strap feed long end under strings on guitar head.You now have a quick release strap holder.Very well made & strong ! ! Happy I found this before spending way more than I needed to ! ! Highly recommend this product ! ! Joe	1
It 's about the size of a credit card , and half as thick as a deck of cards . It 's fairly light and the plastic feels a bit cheap but it does the job it 's supposed to do . You can either play the notes to the built in mic or connect it directly via a guitar cable . It has a switch to change between Bass and Guitar , and it accounts for the extra strings on 5 string basses or 7 string guitars.It also has a button to tune it down lower ( 5 half steps ) so you can do some alternate tunings too.Lastly it has a button for & # 34 ; Sound & # 34 ; so that it produces a tone for you to tune something to manually . The display is very fine and kinda hard to read , but it has lights above the LCD screen to show if it 's flat , in tune or sharp , so you can focus on that if you have trouble.It comes with 2 AAA batteries . I have no idea how long they 'll last yet but I have some rechargeable batteries for use in it later .	1
They do what they are meant to do . No complaint for the price and they have a pretty dang cool lookin design to them .	1
I have been using these strings for the last 7 years . The tone last longer than any other string and they do n't break on me . In those 7 years I have n't broke a single string . That being said I do n't play heavy at all . I will buy these strings until the day I die . especially the acoustic version of these ...	1
This pedal is beyond loud . It 's to the point where if you crank this pedal with a 15 watt amp with an 8 & # 34 ; speaker , you will get noise complaints from the end of your neighborhood . To match it up with the clean tone that I get out of my amp , I have to set the level in between 1 and 2 .	1
For not a whole lot of money it does what more expensive EQ pedals do . Its well made and sturdy with a metal body .	1
I have an Axe-Fx 2 that requires quality monitoring ( I do use studio monitors , but sometimes I need something that no one else can hear ) , and for a while was using the Senheiser HD 280 Pro headphones.When I put these on ( without burning them in ) , I was blown away at the difference ! for $ 20 more , these cans are more than worth the extra cashAlso better , is the leather wrapped around the arc- much sturdier , while the pad on my Senheisers is flaking off , piece by piece .	1
I own a few tuners , including a Boss Tu-70 . Recently I purchased and reviewed the new GoGo TT-1 clip on tuner . I never thought a clip on could be as accurate and dependable as my Boss . The GoGo is awesome and instantly became the only tuner I use . But now I have to say , I think the Snark is a little better . I bought the SN-1 and the SN-2 because they are so inexpensive and so amazingly accurate . The other great thing is they are chormatic , so besides being a great tuner , you can leave it clipped on to the headstock to practice accurate string bending or just learning the notes on the fretboard . The display is very easy to read ... better than the GoGo ( although GoGo has a new improved display since I bought mine ) . I love the colors and the matte finish too . The rubbery matte finish makes gripping the clip much easier than the smooth plastic of other tuners . The rubber surface also makes opening the battery compartment a snap too , I had to fight like heck to get the battery door open on my GoGo . The Snark is less than half the price of my GoGo and out performs it ... it 's a no brainer .	1
I received this capo yesterday and it works perfectly on my acoustic guitar . It is styled very much like the Kyser capos but cost about one third of what you 'd pay for a Kyser . It is made of aluminum , NOT ABS plastic as another reviewer suggested . The spring is plenty strong enough to hold down all 6 strings with no problems . The rubber pad is flat and this capo works well on guitars with a flat fret board . I do n't know how well it would work on a guitar with a curved radius fret board . I 'm thinking it may not hold the high and low `` E '' strings down sufficiently to keep them from buzzing . I could be wrong . Keep in mind it is very important to fully depress the spring when moving the capo up or down the neck . Sliding it will cause wear on the rubber pad on any capo . The wound strings will cut into the rubber like a file if you slide it on the strings . I really have n't had it long enough to see if it will stand the test of time , but as the title of my review reads : `` So far , So good '' It 's very reasonably priced and I 'm very pleased with it . I rate it at 5 stars . It 's well worth the money . It 's very unlikely to break and if I find the rubber pad wears out prematurely , I will update my review .	1
I bought this wax and compared it to Meguiars I 've been using for years and it surpasses Meguiars by miles . I have a few guitars and they really shine with this wax , you can really see the depth of the paint with this wax and it works great on headstocks also . I like the applicator and the fact that this is a paste wax which is effortless to apply.Along with a few high end guitars , I also have a few beaters . I used this wax on an old Squier that is thoroughly used and it looks fantastic . fine scratches and blems are gone and the guitar looks great.I use old t shirts to buff the wax off the guitars and found that it comes off chrome easilly , I overdid it with an older Les Paul guitar and was surprised to see the wax come off with ease . I will buy this stuff again and again , my local guitar shop sells this for the same price .	1
works well when jumping or combining your system with XLR 's for noise and clear sound . ease in connecting and reconnecting system	1
For what this does you ca n't go wrong for the price ! I have a small recording setup and play guitar ( and bass ) with friends . This little mixer gets both of those jobs done right . Sure a more expensive mixer might be able to tweek your vocals or instruments more , but all I needed was a way to mix up to 4 inputs at at time and out put to my speakers and laptop for recording . It does all of those jobs well . There is no hum when the unit is on . I have two small grips though..and they are minor ... the EQ is n't that great and the volume to the headphones is lower than I like . Maybe I 'm going deaf .	1
This stand really is pretty tough . I have carries it in my gig bag and it has been thrown around and stepped on etc ... . Still works great .	1
I built a CBG recently and decided to go with these strings as suggested on several websites . The sound I get from the AD & G strings sound great wit the piezo pickup and a tube amp . The strings seem to hold up well . I can not comment on how well they hold a tune because anyone who knows cigar box guitars knows that keeping them in tone with parts like round head bolts for a nut and an eye bolt for a bridge can be an uphill battle . These strings sound great , I was thinking of stringing my electric acoustic guitar with them also to compare the two styles of playing .	1
The Danelectro FAB series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget . The D-2 Overdrive effects pedal works great and gives me that soft growl fuzz that works well when playing the blues ... . The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is & # 34 ; It tends to be a little noisey & # 34 ; if you turn the gain up too much . You can get a noise filter to add to you pedal board that will take care of this and any other noise problems you may have . This series of pedals ( FAB ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well . Danelectro offers more expensive units but I do n't think the sound is much better , just the hardware is better , but my view ! ! ! . You ca n't go wrong with this product , Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product ... I have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great ...	1
Terrific way to tray out various picks without committing to a whole pack of something you might not end up liking . And high praise for GO-DPS Music . These guys had the product out the door the same day I ordered it , sent some great sale information on other gear , and included a catalog explaining the specs of all the picks I 'd ordered . I only spent 1.99 and I really felt like they went out of their way to earn more of my business - which they did !	1
While I 've never been a big delay guy , I 've always felt my pedal board was missing this particular effect . I 'm definitely not a fan of digital delay , so I did a lot of R & D ; on analog delays in hopes to find the right one for me.There are basically three options out there for delays under $ 200 : MXR Carbon Copy , EHX Memory Boy , and Malekko Ekko 616 . I realize that there are other pedals out there , but according to my research these are the best three for the price.The Memory Boy seemed good but my concern was it can do a lot of exaggerated modulation , something I was not interesting in . Crazy effects are an EHX trademark so if you 're looking for that sort of thing the Memory Boy might be up your alley . I read nothing but good things about the Malekko Ekko and tossed back and forth between that and the Carbon Copy for a while and ultimately went with the Carbon Copy because I was able to find the most first-hand reviews of it.I do n't regret my decision , this pedal sounds great . The repeats are long and do not sound artificial . Some people complain the repeats are too dark but I do n't think those people understand the difference between analog and digital delay . If you 're looking to recreate The Edge sound , analog delay is not for you.I 'm able to create all types of sounds from this pedal from just thickening up a rhythm track , to slapstick , to dreamy repeats on solos . I love it . Sometimes I just leave the pedal on with the mix knob dialed down for subtle ambience in my tone.One minor criticism is that the modulation effect is subtile , at least out-of-the-box . There are internal trimpots to make the effect more pronounced but I have yet to mess with them . I would rather have had the controls be knobs on the pedal itself .	1
I used to think a pick was a pick , with the only difference being stiffness . ( I should say that I prefer picks of medium stiffness ) . The only problems I had with `` regular '' picks was : ( 1 ) them slipping in my hand ( turning around ) , ( 2 ) out of my hand ( on the floor ) , and , of course , ( 3 ) breaking . I decided to give the Dava picks a try . I bought a pack of the `` jazz '' picks and a pack of these `` grip tips '' . I really thought I 'd like the jazz picks better : that they would be easier to grip and more like a regular pick . But , after trying them both , I find these ( the grip trips ) are now my `` pick of choice '' . They fit my grip perfectly , stay put in my hand , and give me maximum control when I play , whether it 's lead or rhythm . I have yet to break one . I 'm mainly buying another set because I 've given a few away for people to try and I want to have plenty readily available . I like to leave picks laying around my house at various optimum locations , so whenever I pick up a guitar to play , I 've got one close by ( also always keep a spare in my wallet ) . Bottom line is , for me at least , these picks are tops ! Sure I can still use a regular pick when that 's all that 's available . But why not use the best when I can ? ? ? Update : Been using these picks for a year since my first review . Still love them . Still have yet to break one ( and I can be an aggressive strummer ) . The only reason I need to buy more : I lose them . I have to admit they are a bit pricey , compared to other picks . But for me , they are still tops . Which is why I 'm buying another half dozen .	1
MY experience with crybaby is it has a great tone . More overbearing than the Vox or cleaner wahs . BUT I know several people who have had problems with the switch , and I have watched countless others stomping on their crybaby in futile attempts to engage or disengage the pedal.I actually use a BBE and Vox since this frustration with my 1st wah . But I am not sure that I am giving up tone in exchange for the headache avoidance ! I kinda think I am . The VOX and BBE seem to have a brighter sound which is less `` wah-ed '' if you will . It could be accentuated by me playing a Strat instead of the Les Paul Custom/Boogie combination I used with the crybaby .	1
item is really convienient . Small , unobtrusive size w/ good illumination for easy reading . I like the swivel design & swivel display that allow you to connect it to whatever side of the headstock you want . Price ca n't be beat either .	1
This is thus far a good bargain . I have used it to hang a 12 heavy string . The arms of it adjust to neck size but when the weight of the guitar pull downward the grip tightlt . No chance of falling . There are likely better units out there but for the money this one is a steal .	1
Great deal for the price . Works fine , but like all cheap pickups it basically makes my acoustic sound like a clean electric . Did the job for what I needed . Now I know I would love a better one like a Fishman .	1
I 'm happy with this . Used it to replace the blown speaker from a 30 yr. old 60W Roland Cube Amp ( a bass player used the amp and I think it was too much for the speaker -- next time I 'll use the PA for the bass player ) . Much better sound , perfect fit , etc . Keep in mind this is for a very clean sound and this speaker was recommended for its clean and somewhat smokey-type sound . I believe it has those . Using this for jazz applications and having the Roland around as a second amp .	1
I love these picks and the .88mm seems to be the perfect balance of stiffness and suppleness for my playing .	1
WOW , is putting it mildly when you here the quality sound that these strings produce on a 12 string.Endless beauty when you here the tones produced by Elixer . Elixer strings are more expensive than other strings but well worth the higher price tag . You can not go go with a set or two of Elixers .	1
I was leery of this since it was half the total price of just about every other one I considered . Because of the return policy I took a chance and am not only glad I did , but am also thoroughly impressed with this hanger.First , I doubt if I could build one for anywhere near the price of this if I purchased the materials locally . Factor in that shipping ( at the time of my purchase ) is free and this is a no brainer.Installation is also a no bainer and made so by the mounting hardware that comes with the hanger.There is one concern you may have . If you have instruments with nitrocellulose finishes the protective rubber sleeves on the hanging fork may eat into those finishes . Personally , mine are being used to hang a cheap Squire Strat and J-bass , and an Epiphone Les Pail Junior II - instruments more decorative than functional . I am not saying the sleeves will ruin the finish , but merely raising that possibility to help you to make a purchase decision.The bottom line , though , is if you are hanging guitars that do not have a nitrocellulose finish these hangers are a bargain . In fact , they are probably the best deal you are likely to find and are worth every cent .	1
This is a little more expensive than some other brands , but i think it sounds great and it 's way more durable than a plastic pedal.I 'm pretty new to electric guitar so i 'm not really a distortion and tone expert like some other reviewers . To me this this sounds better and is easier to adjust than my modeling amp , so I think it 's a good purchase .	1
Once you place the pedals on it , it 's kinda heavy ... but it wo n't hurt your back . I arranged 11 pedals on the frame and they fit perfectly.No brainer , built to last and the carrying case it 's outstanding.Cheers ! ! ! !	1
Not much you can say about these , they 're knobs ! They fit perfectly and are of high quality finish . They finish off my bass nicely as I like to have the numerals there for reference .	1
This stuff is great . The other guys are always coming over and grabin a shot or two cause I leave it in the pedal board . Iv'e been using this for years . I like smooth slippery strings for speed and ease . Humidity not a problem with this stuff . .	1
Against most educated and experienced advice from many blogs I installed one of these in my 1972 Twin Reverb 100 watt . The original speakers are too Hi-Fi sounding for me.They hurt my ears , so clean . This speaker has all the range and a little bonus sizzle to boot , but in a round , full , musical way . Again to those who may like to tread in my ill advised path , these are 50 watt speakers , the Twin Reverb is 100 watts . Right now I have the CR and one original speaker running in my TR . I 'll get another CR if this one holds up okay . But I 'm in a band that plays small rooms a lot so I dont crank it past 4-5 very often . I 'll post an update if this speaker fails . But at least on an initial run , I 'm glad I bought it.Rock And Roll Forever !	1
I can see this strap lasting a long time . I love how I do n't need new strap buttons , considering that the screws may be smaller than the original strap button screws ( which facilitates the strap button falling out and your guitar smacks the limestone floor ! ) .You can lock each strap button with one hand- great product !	1
I got this because of the price . As soon as I opened it , the first thing I noticed was that it feels like it 's not too sturdy . I do n't know if it 's going to last me a while . But , it does its job . Works fine on some guitars . The neck has to be thinner , though . I have to be careful when I put it on , as well as when I remove it . I 'd pay for a better one if I had to get another .	1
I am a big fan of the movie & # 34 ; Tenacious D and the Pick of destiny & # 34 ; so when I saw these picks I just had to get them !	1
GLS Audio 25ft Mic Cable is very High Quality . You will not be disappointed . Low cost , long lasting . I 'm very satisfied .	1
These locking tuners are perfect for any Strat or Tele . I have an American Strat and an American Tele that both came with fairly decent non-locking tuners . I also have a Carvin and two Paul Reed Smith guitars that came with locking tuners ... they are certainly worth having . Fenders ( at least American-made ones ) are very easy to swap out tuners for these ... the holes are already there , there 's no need to drill holes for screws , everything is so easy you have to do it yourself . I 've swapped out the tuners and have never looked back ... the only question is what to do with the non-locking Fender tuners I have now !	1
Got these to stop the pegs from slipping in my cheap new violin . Added a couple drops , and it worked like a charm . A must buy for anyone buying a cheap starter violin .	1
I bought this tuner for my mandolin . I have to play a little louder than I 'd like for the tuner to hear me . The display is not as nice or easy to interact with as some tuning displays I 've seen . But it 's so small that I never have to take it off , and it 's doing its job well . I 'm pretty fond of this little guy .	1
I 'll keep it short : I owned a Boss EQ pedal in the past and did n't have much luck with it . I tried and tried and tried to hone in the sound I was looking for but the Boss just would n't do it for me . Fast forward a few years and I purchase this little baby on a whim . Man , am I glad I did ! The 6 sliders made it very easy to dial in the exact tone I was looking for . A small boost of the first two sliders gave my amp more bottom-end than it could ever manage on its own , and a small boost of the last two provided more of a balanced , well-rounded sound . Love it and would n't wan na part with it ! The pedal itself is built like a rock . I imagine nothing shy of nuclear war could dent this thing . The individual sliders , although not quite as Ford-tough as the rest of the pedal ( haha ) , feel nice and slide easy . Each slider lights up red when engaged , which not only looks cool but makes it very easy to see on a dimly lit stage.If you 're on the fence about an EQ or which EQ brand to buy , I recommend you give this little monster a stomp .	1
Fender 's new Mini Acoustic Guitar Stand is one of two new stands , the other is for electric guitars . Sturdy , reliable and easy to take on gigs or use in the studio or at home . - Michael Haller , 'Captain Soul 's Sound Circus '	1
This is a handy little tool . The winder is nice and the clipper works well . It does n't pull the bridge pegs out so it does n't get five stars from me . And do n't be too rough when winding or it will break .	1
Some say `` this capo work bad '' I have to ask `` are your guitar is good enough to use this capo ? '' or `` are you know how to use capo ? `` I 'm more than 20 years of playing guitar . This capo is worth the price . Good quality and work great for not extream user ( Are you nuts ? ) . Best recomended quality and price . PS . May not for very big guitar neck ! Enjoy !	1
Needed this cable to hook up my Dean EVO to a practice amp . Ca n't complain ; it 's a pretty nice , standard instrument cable that makes my guitar sound clean and loud , which is what I wanted .	1
I did my research on this buy . I looked at a lot of reviews , as well as youtube reviews comparing other headphones , and these seemed to be the clear favorites over other competitors such as Beats Pro ( in which you 're spending at least $ 100 of the total $ 200 on just the name alone , such a rip-off if you ask me ) . These are very clear and fine tuned . My only knock on these is that they could use a little more padding for the top of my head .	1
Hard to believe that I need to review a Pick but I really like these picks . I got a half dozen for Christmas and was thrilled . I also got one of those Pick Punches ( Super cool item if you ever get a chance to get one- it is the 351 style and a standard credit card is dang close to the Medium Fender Pick ) Only thing I do n't like about these picks is that they seem to wander away on their own so keep an eye on them .	1
it is not a replacement for a TS 808 or 09 but it has its own tone and overdrive which works good enough .	1
man ya 'll yall better quick get this here mic yo cuz it 's all good and stuff man . because like when you be spittin some siK leeriX and all like i be going in the paint like weezy and eminem ya feel me.ay yo let 's go .	1
I got what I ordered . However , if I had paid more attention , this is nothing but a standard power supply which I could have gotten much cheaper from a radio shack or like type store without the Tascam name on it.UPDATE 5-03-2012 after receiving comments and reading other reviews : I 've gotten a comment and have read many comments and I do n't know where the fault lies , but this power supply is NOT the power supply for the new replacement Tascam DR-07MKII . The power supply for that unit is the PS-P515UIf you are unsure what power supply for which model Tascam recorder you have , go to Tascam 's website and research it before buying it.The Tascam PSP520 AC Adapter/Power Supply For Mpgt1 is for and DOES work with the older Tascam DR-07 recorder . I have been using this recording as a stand alone unit and taking a line out on a powered PA head using the this power supply and it works just fine and the quality of the recorder is excellent .	1
I used it about twice and so far it is a good product I also use it to check sync with my other tuners	1
Still glad I have it -Would prefer to exchange a slightly larger package for full size keys , and the action is a little weak - less than 'synth ' action..but it works great , weighs almost nothing and is ultra-portable .	1
Ay yo homie this interface be off the hook you know i be all interfacin and stuff you feel . thx behringer .	1
Very comfortable bench . It 's wider than most , which makes is more comfortable to use . It feels heavy duty , and stays still during use .	1
I have four of these - and will continue to use this product . You 'll purchase this system first , then all you need to do is get the replacement packs . For my Taylor Baby , the string spacing was a little small , but there was no problem inserting the pack in my other three guitars . Very easy to use . As a recommendation for keeping your guitar in good condition , I would also buy a humidity meter so you can keep tabs on the room where you store your instruments .	1
nice sturdy construction for the most part , although I do n't like the plastic that connects the fabric to the ends . But for the price , you get what you pay for . I would have much better liked it if they were metal . I put this on my Les Paul and it fit good , but I decided it was not the look I wanted on that guitar so I put it on my BC Rich instead . The BC Rich has both of its strap mount points on the rear of the guitar , so when I adjusted the length to a comfortable position , the adjustment buckle is now on my neck and shoulder rather than on my back . I 'll give it a try for a while , but I think that is going to annoy me and will need to find it a new home on one of my other guitars or just keep it around as a spare .	1
but I keep thinking it is going to interfere with tuning at the nutwill be trying to get more use in .	1
I bought this as i had already purchased tow other Joyo pedals just to see what the buzz was about.This phaser is perfect . I do not use a dramatic effect , more or an EVH setting for leads . This pedal is 99.8 % sounding like the MXR . I never give anything a 100 % . This is a a great phase pedal , great tone and a great price . I am done thinking a good pedal must cost $ 200 and above . This was like $ 35 and sounds awesome !	1
These strings are what I use on all of my acoustic guitars . The sound and tone are great , and the price is right . They shipped quickly and I will order again and again .	1
Love this kit ... it has everything you need as well as cleaning cloths ... .make your axe shine and look like a rockstar .	1
This is a great portable uke stand to have with you . It folds up small and will fit in the outside pocket on your uke gig bag . Having this stand is a lot better than just laying your uke on the floor .	1
Pretty decent sound , and it 's not too small for an adult to play , but having no pickup on the left hand side severely limits the warm , jazzy tones you can get . Still very satisfied .	1
The width is nice , wide enough to distribute the weight , but not too wide . Attaching it is a snap . The suede gives it a nice 'grip ' to your shoulder so the guitar does n't slide around .	1
This comes COMPLETE with bridge , saddles and full size block ... and it 's FENDER ! I do n't think this is a true steel block . I believe it 's Zinc Alloy but that 's Fender 's fault . The company I bought it from , Ant Hill Music via Amazon , is very honest and likable people . I have nothing but respect for them and bought two of these for Squiers . They made my cv50 's sound fuller with greater sustain . I 'm sure I 'll buy more in the future.I should add it does not come with a whammy bar but your my old squier whammy bars fit perfectly into it !	1
These strings have a snappier feel and a louder volume ( amplified ) than regular nickel / steel strings . Cobalt is a different material for making strings and is supposed to have a higher output and a longer life . I recently ordered the new M-Steels from Ernie Ball to try them out as they are supposed to have even more Cobalt for even better output . I use P90 single coils on my Godin LG and these strings sound great . They have a nice feel to them and I can bend the heck out of them . No breaking . No problems with slipping and tuning . I 'm hoping the M-Steels will be even better , but if not , these are a vast improvement over the regular strings that I was using , which were Ernie Ball 's regular slinky 's , made from Nickel .	1
I buy and sell electric guitars and often I meet with someone at a half-way point where access to electricity is unavailable . I was surprised at the volume and tone that came out of a unit so small . There is even and overdrive which makes this totally cool as some of my customers want to schredd a little . This is battery operated but can be plugged in using an adapter . I bought a Planet Waves 9V Power adapter to go with the Honey Tone . It might work in a Busker situation .	1
There are lots of ways to tune a guitar ranging from using a tuning fork to sitting next to a properly tuned piano . I 've also used a variety of electronic tuners over the years with everything from rows of flashing lights to meters with a needle . There are some excellent tuners out there with tone generators , metronomes , etc . built in . But this device is simple , portable , easy to use , and just plain works . It 's also cheap enough that even if you have other types of tuners , it 's worth the money to get one of these for each guitar case . Aside from its simplicity , it 's also less bothered by background noise , as other units with microphones might be .	1
I really did n't expect this guitar strap to be anything more than what it is . It 's tight knit nylon with leather to attach to the strap posts , It 's not a super fancy top of the line guitar strap , but it serves it 's purpose well . feels sturdy enough and it 's adjustable for a man of any size . I ordered it on the 20th and received it on the 23rd , no complaints here . If you are like me and do not feel that it is necessary to spend 20 $ or 30 $ on a guitar strap then this would suit you just fine , for 6 $ you ca n't beat it . buy one or 2 nothing to lose here	1
I 've seen Joey Jordison from Slipknot playing on a metal folding chair before , so i 'm going to say right off the bat that you can play sitting on just about anything . It 's pretty hard to make a crappy product when it comes to Drum Thrones , so with that I 'm going to say you 're either going to get a great product or something that you ca n't even use . In this case , you can look forward to getting a great product here ! The stool is very sturdy , no rocking , no swaying , no moving at all . Very comfortable ... in fact , my girlfriend grabs it to sit on every time she comes into my studio to hang out with me . Worth the money , great product !	1
Sure there are fancier Tremolo pedals out there , but I 've always been a fan of the Boss TR-2 . It 's got a more mellow and vintage Fender Tremolo output , and suits my playing to a T. Pair this beauty up with an Electro-Harmonix Cathedral Reverb pedal , and get lost for days . Definitely worth the reasonable cost !	1
works great and to me its cheap . cant see why you would buy a more expensive guitar cable.Highly recomended	1
Bought this for my daughter along with her new guitar . It seems to work well , no issues in the first couple of weeks .	1
This little cable gets used on my practice amp . I love the 90 degree connection . The overall quality seems good and I have had no problems .	1
bought these for my Squire Strat . I was changing the look with new pickgaurd , nobs and switch tips . these nobs fit great and look great . I would difenantly recomend them	1
This product is great . You can have a lot of pedals including big ones and volume/wah pedals . Read the description so you can have a sense of size . Tue quality is very nice , solid and resistible . The soft case is very nice also .	1
This tiny little amp is great for practicing outside or in a canoe or while hang gliding . But it is not very good at parties . it can not compete with the noise level that 20 people in conversation can make . It is cheap , so you should just get one . I am having great fun experimenting around with different settings , instruments , and power feed voltage levels . ( see the danelectro power supply for this thing , really cool ! )	1
Worked perfectly to use my Samson mic with a stand I purchased . Definitely would purchase again , solid quality build . Good purchase !	1
I got this becasue our bassist got his hands on one and loved it . I have a stompbox tuner but this Shark is really fantastic.Easy to use and very accurate . It makes tuning a breeze .	1
I picked this up for a friend who has the AudioTechnica AT2020 USB and Yes this does work with that mic too . It 's solid , helps with mounting , and will be well used .	1
This has become my number one cable for my Carvin bass . I gig with it a couple times per week and it has been rock solid . I only use something different if I need a longer reach . And I love the tweed cover . Very satisfied with this one .	1
Tried several of pedaltrain in the past ( pt-3 too bulky , and pt-jr a little to small ) , this one holds my pedals perfectly . Simple & light . I love it !	1
This is a very good piece of equipment for its price . Used mildly , it gives the sound a more natural feel .	1
I started experimenting on strings , I say , why would n't I try to use bronze strings for my acoustic guitar ? Awesome I like the brightness of sound it produced . I 'm hooked to bronze strings . Thanks to Martin for making the best bronze acoustic guitar strings !	1
love the on and off switch and the sound is great with little or no feedback , would purchase this mic again .	1
I held out from trying the Boss SD-1 Super Overdrive for many years . Like many guitarists , my first distortion pedal was a Boss DS-1 , which was durable and aggressive , but also extremely frustrating . I might have formed some negative impressions about Boss , when it was probably unfair to do so.The SD-1 is widely owned and very affordable ( usually around $ 50 ) . It 's similar in a lot of ways to the Ibanez TS-9 Tubescreamer , except that a Tubescreamer reissue costs twice as much . A lot of guitarists consider the SD-1 to be more of a `` rock '' overdrive , while the TS-9 is more of a `` tube/blues '' effect . There 's probably some truth to that , but both of them are excellent pedals.However , the SD-1 really impressed me with its transparency and versatility . You CAN simply plug into it and use it alone with a clean channel . But that is n't necessarily the best use for the pedal - it excels as a `` booster '' pushing an already overdrive amp , or stacking with other distortion/OD pedals . One of the best settings is turning the Level all the way up and the gain all the way down . This adds just a little bit of grit to your tone , and really sounds great.A feel that lot of people give the SD-1 mediocre reviews for reasons that are n't fair . You hear things like `` it cuts out too much bass '' , when that 's really what the pedal is supposed to do . The midrange hump , when set up properly , can take away the muddiness of your tone and help you cut through a band during live playing . And , like I said before , I feel as if it 's MORE transparent in retaining elements of the clean tone than the TS-9 , though preference between the two is entirely subjective.But you also know that it 's a Boss pedal , which means it 's as durable as they come . The thing will stand up to years of abuse , and can be used in any number of roles . If you 're looking for a single pedal to make a small amp sound `` big '' , there are probably better options in this range . ( Try the under-appreciated MD-2 Mega Distortion , or the excellent Joyo Ultimate Drive ) . But if you understand what this pedal is supposed to do and use it for that purpose , you 'll understand why this thing has been popular for over 30 years .	1
At & lt ; $ 20 , this is a great bargain , but it is a very basic bag . It fits my Les Paul Standard snugly and has back straps for easy carrying . These are also easily removed if they bother you . This Epiphone gigbag also has a zippered pocket for accessories ( holds a strap , patch cord , but not much else ) and features nice looking graphics .	1
I liked the strap , used it for many years and it held up great . The texture almost looks fake though .	1
It is very well made , is easy to use , and holds down the strings just fine . It is well protected as to not scratch or nick your guitar .	1
The Hosa XLR cables are affordable and very heavily made.I have a large mixer and rack and cables everywhere.I decided to purchase shorter cables and the Hosa cables 5ft measurement worked perfectly.You really will not be disappointed with these .	1
These just sound flat in comparison to Elixir Nanowebs and they do n't feel as good either.I guess I just prefer coated acoustic strings .	1
I bought this along with a new guitar for my daughter , as she is learning to play . My son has also joined in the fun . This is a pretty complex amp , and will require quite a bit of time to figure out everything that it can do . It can be a little daunting for a newbie .	1
An all-in-one guitar tool that is a must-have for any guitar case ! Great quality string winder and cutter ! Plus , it is extremely low priced ! Do n't hesitate ... get one !	1
I 'm enjoying it . I actually bought it keep my amp off the floor but I also like that it puts the amp at an angle pointing upwards . It 's supporting my 50 pound amp easily and has n't tilted back or fallen over . I 'm glad I bought it and would buy from the company again . Thank You .	1
I am very pleased with the product . It has performed better than I had expected . I recommend it highly . I shall probably order more from this company in the future .	1
This is not a top tier condenser mic , but it is well worth the 40 dollar price tag . It has 2 different pattern modes as well as a gain boost switch . The carrying case is also nice.Do not expect this to be MXL or even Behringer B-1 quality , but it 's still better than no condenser , and is perfect for doing room acoustics or live mic'ing .	1
Bought it as a gift . Friend loved it very much .	1
I have been purchasing these strings for over 15 years now . Only string that I allow to touch my electric guitars .	1
For players that want a high quality guitar strap that weighs almost nothing , last forever , stays in place , and has classic good looks there is not a better strap than Levy 's natural leather , suede strap ( without the piping and stiched edge ) . The dying of the suede side is deep and flawless and the strap is a quality piece of hide without bulk or unnecessary weight from padding . Feels great to the touch and you quickly forget that its even touching your shoulder . It can be a little bit of a chore to get strap locks on , but once on I have never had any worries or failures so that my guitars are nick and ding free . Plenty of color choices . This is a simple , elegant strap that inspires envy . Planet wave has a nice strap that is the only one I 've seen ( and owned ) that even comes close , but there is no other suede strap that is even in the same ball park as the Levy MS26 . I own 4 and they are admired by everyone who sees them and slips them over their shoulder . It could cause you to reconsider use of shoulder straps ... It did for me .	1
I bought them at 45 dollars . Use for small music gigs and DJ/MC uses . They are great for DJ uses or other things where the quality of the voice is n't so important , as long as you can be heard and understood . I recommend for use of : 1 . Small music venues ( smaller bands ) , Djing , public speaking , band practices/rehearses , etc.For higher quality microphones at a reasonable price , look at the Audix OM2 when it 's around 80 bucks , or Audio Technica products .	1
The rosin does the trick , and it 's cased in a nice wooden holder , so it should n't crack easily ( unlike those round rosin containers ) .	1
I read some of the reviews and that people almost had to guess what strings were what . However on the bag that it comes with , to prevent corrosion , and on the box itself have a color coded guide saying what string is what color on the nut . The strings themselves are the normal color for strings .	1
Well i got this after hearing seasick steve its cool i havent figured it out just yet but its a very good product	1
Let me be upfront . I often use my electric guitar unplugged . When I am plugged in , I do n't move around a lot . So this cord does not get a good frequent use and abusing . But no hum or noise and seems solid . It was very affordable . Ca n't say how it would perform if used live and in performance all the time , but for the price , I can not complain at all . I suspect it will always work good for me due to its light usage .	1
I 've used these on the reg for a year . Obviously there are better sounding monitors out there , but these are really great for what you pay for IMO.I 'd recommend these to someone trying to save some money.UPDATEtwo years in with continued regular use . they sound just as good as they did a year ago .	1
This is my guitar pick of choice . I fits well in my hand and is well balanced . Have tons of picks , but seem to use this one all the time .	1
This is the perfect fit for all my basses . I have two Ibanez and two Essex basses . They recommend the light top medium bottom string gauge . I play fingerstyle and they feel great . They have corrosion resistant packaging and since corrosion is what kills your strings the longer you can keep it at bay the better . They are made in the USA and they use recycled packaging . I can not attest to their lifespan but the package says long life so we will concede that point .	1
My pet use to roam the car while driving . He has learned to stay stationed and relaxes a lot more !	1
I think picks are like , well you know , a personal choice , I bought these cause they are simple , inexpensive and will compare to others I have . Been using these lately . Would buy again .	1
This drop clutch is just fantastic.. I have used them for years and always buy the same model . Nothing on the market works as well as this . Simple installation , and it allows you to use your double bass pedals or double kick with a closed hi hat all from tapping it with your drumstick.. It could n't be easier.. Best Buy on the Market .	1
JF-02 : OMFG ! No need to get all OCD about emptying your Full wallet to get the Tone needed ! I tried this on Strats , an LP , & a Harrington , through my slightly modded VC5212 ( Webber speakers ) tube amp ; clean channel . No hum , noisiness , ,built solid . The English instructions are n't really useful as the pedal itself is self-explanatory.I 'm possibly half deaf but have been doing this for 20+ years . I 'll be experimenting with a tube pre and running through a solid state to see what happens . There are many factors that make tone and this is only a small part of it . Your attitude and hands create the sound in the end . A pedal does not make you play better , practice does . If you are familiar with the OCD or can get one and a/b side by side it , you 'll be amazed . Cool looking pedal box to boot .	1
These replace the OEM tuners exactly without requiring any modification of the headstock . They look fine . When I get the guitar back together I expect that they will work properly . Delivered on time as promised	1
Oh man am i glad I found this deal , no more $ 8.00 for strings anymore , there the exact same as you would get from the store , delivered through USPS , dont have to go anywhere , how cool is that , 5 out of 5 Stars , but of course , its ERNIE BALL .	1
These guitar picks are just the best . Simply put . They are easy to grip onto , even when your hands are sweaty from rocking out all day . Highly recommended . I will never use any other guitar pick other than a Dunlop Tortex . I use the green 88mm picks , and also the orange 60mm ones . I recommend you buy both the green picks and orange picks . Great for beginners or the pros .	1
This is a modeling amp . IT has several presets , to emulate different sounds . They factory settings for these are pretty good , and all but the first bank ( of three ) can be adjusted and saved as new presets on the amp . If you get the fender fuse software ( license comes with the amp ) you can get some pretty amazing & # 34 ; pre & # 34 ; sets from fender and other users.This is not a massive cabinet , so you are n't going to get that & # 34 ; big & # 34 ; a sound , regardless . But for a small room it 's great ! Common complaint I have seen : No clean channel/preset.This is not the case . There are a couple of factory presets that are & # 34 ; clean & # 34 ; although some people want cleaner . You can either adjust the gain/vol yourself or download one of several VERY nice very clean presets from the fender forums . That said , one of my guitars is edgy , it wants to overdrive the amp . Another does n't , and is very clean , even on the factory preset clean.I very nearly got a different amp . I went to a music store and a salesman showed me a Mustang II . I was sold when he showed me what all it could do - then showed me the price for a Mustang I ! ! For ~ $ 100 USD this is about as much as you could possibly ask for.It 'll keep me busy for a long time .	1
The CM-2 is magnificent : [ 1 ] It produces beautiful overdrive ( one that does n't destroy your guitar 's tone ) . [ 2 ] It has independent `` High '' and `` Low '' tone controls , and these controls are extremely sensitive to even minor changes -- thus allowing for great versatility in tone-manipulation . [ 3 ] It features a switch that allows you to pick between `` classic '' overdrive and an extra blast of distortion ( `` modified '' ) . [ 4 ] The case is made of metal . [ 5 ] It comes with a cover for the knobs so that you can avoid altering your settings when depressing the pedal . This pedal will not give you `` metal '' distortion ; for that consider Digitech 's TL-2 . Instead , it produces a warm , old-time overdriven tone . I love this thing !	1
I bought aBehringer 802 Premium 8 Input Preampsback in July and I did n't know that I needed this . So now that I have it , I can finally record to my laptop ! Great product !	1
Actually , it was really easy to install..i just losen 6,5,4,3 string and just put it in and it was over ! i felt volume coming out from sound hole is bigger than beforebut tone , i do n't know.. maybe im dumb enough to not notice	1
I bought this to use on an older acoustic guitar neck which was a bit faded and after 2 uses , the wood looks great again . I used the honey twice in 2 days and brought back the maple wood to like new condition.This honey works fast and well and will make playing the fingerboard alot easier . I saw this in my local shop for the same price minus shipping after I bought this , but I do not use it much so it should last a long time .	1
I play with fingernails and just ca n't control standard metal banjo-style fingerpicks because I ca n't feel the strings . I used Alaska picks for years , which are very good . These are better . They give the control of nails , yet the tone and protection of metal - and I can feel the strings ! Muting , harmonics , everything ... If you play with nails and want finger picks , these are for you .	1
I really feel like this thing is my personal slave , just standing off to the side , waiting to grab my guitar when I hand it off . It is reliable and rock solid . The tripod base has been very steady so far . It really is a great product.The other thing I have to say about this stand is that it has the non-scuff padding on the all the RIGHT places . I bought another stand from another company that claimed to have similar material . And it did , but not at all the guitar contact points.I do have to laugh at the folks here and on Musician 's Friend who have given this a bad rating because of the following:1 . `` It ejected my guitar when it got tilted forward . '' - The basic idea is their guitar was on-stage , someone pushed the stand forward , the patented guitar retaining mechanism disengaged when the base of the guitar touch the floor on the way to the ground , releasing the guitar and dumping on the floor . REALITY : Let 's say the stand held onto the guitar . It still would have hit face first and messed up the guitar . Sometimes accidents happen . Do n't blame the stand . Blame the moron who knocked over your guitar.2 . `` The guitar touches the floor . '' - It 's not supposed to ! Try elevating the next , or make sure you bought the model appropriate for your kind of guitar.This stand is worth the extra money over those $ 15 disasters . Spend an extra $ 10 and save yourself the headache .	1
I 've played this pedal for a while now and really dig it . I 'm old school , Fender Blues Deluxe reissue and Strats and Teles , this pedal has a great , warm , organic feeling tremolo that I use a lot . You can barely bring it in for some warmth , or really crank the speed and depth for a great sort of rotary speaker effect.I 'll use it with the rate set at tempo for a song and record clean guitar chords up on the middle of the neck . This effect will give you a nice almost Hammond B-3 type of organ sound .	1
I thought I was using good guitar cables but I kept getting intermittence with one.So I tried this Monster cable . It eliminated the problem.My only minor complaint is that it is very stiff . This is minor but no matter what I do it curls up unless you have it fully extended.I would still recommend it though .	1
Case arrived in great condition.Quite Roomy , fits my Vendetta AND/Or my Les Paul - Two exterior pockets for tools , extras , etc.2x Thicker padding than the Epiphone gig bag I got for the LP , but all these have to do is protect and keep dust away - I 'm not hauling them to shows ... Get One .	1
This bridge is heavily constructed , so the amplified sound is much more vibrant and alive . It must weigh twice as much as the bridge from my old Indiana Custom S-Type Guitar . I 'm glad I replaced it . Now I have a lot more guitar for my money . I probably spent $ 200 total on my Fender bridge assembly , locking tuners , and Tex-Mex pickups , as well as the original $ 59 for my used guitar , and I would say I now have the functional equivalent of a $ 500 Fender Stratocaster , based on sound quality and ease of fingering . This was time and money well spent .	1
I put these on a dual humbucker USA Strat . The neck was pre-drilled so the posts on the tuners and the diameter of the center post fit perfectly . Job only took about 15 minutes . Excellent build and looks great .	1
I have been playing for over three decades , and it has been a while since I have owned an electric guitar . I bought this amp along with a Epi Les Paul 100 . All I can say is wow ! This is a great combination.This amp has almost an unlimited number of tones and effects . Well built and looks even better in person than the picture . Plenty of power as well . Better than anything including the stage quality amps like Marshals from back in the day . A great practice amp , but good enough you could use it for a small gig . Going to pick up the optional foot switch.If you buy you wo n't be disappointed .	1
I 've been using these 2.0s as my primary pick for years now and I love them . The way the material surrounds your finger tips is unique and not found in a flat pick . They 're very easy to keep a grip on and allow you to go after the strings confidently.You will however find that there is a sweet spot in the life of the pick 's tip . When you first use them the business end is extremely pointy , sharp almost . After playing a bit , the tip begins to round off and is perfect for a long time . Eventually , it really rounds out and you 'll want a fresh one . I typically lose them before they wear out and they are so nice , you wo n't care .	1
This style of capo CAN throw your guitar out of tune if you do n't put it on right . When used correctly though , it does it 's job just fine .	1
Works great , but it is a little annoying to have to tighten and loosen the screw to use every time.Some responses to comments I 've seen in the reviews : -- I 've had mine for 5 years , used moderately , and the wear on the metal from the bottom of the screw is negligible . Have n't put a pad there or anything. -- The manual screw functionality does , I feel , give an added level of control ... you can make it very tight to ensure no buzz. -- However , range of motion is on the wide side . To get it to properly capo the first fret on my acoustic , I have to put it right on the edge of the 1st string , and screw it down all the way , and it does sometimes leave some buzz.The price is nice though , so I would recommend it as a perfectly fine capo .	1
For the price , this stand cant be beat . You got a mic ? You need a boom stand ? here you go . Does the job .	1
This is my second Spectraflex cable and I love them . I love their flexibility , options for colors and ends , build quality and price . I like to use quality guitar cables for a good sound but I do n't need to spend a fortune on them to be run over on stage by roadies or ripped off because the cable costs more than some guitars do .	1
I sent it back , probably due to my ignorance . Has multiple patterns to collect sound . Was a clear mike but I did n't detect any body to the sound . Maybe a preamp would have helped . I checked out many mikes and ended up with a Rode NT-1A which is probably similar in character . My goal was to record my voice without color and this came close . I wonder how this could have a zillion ratings of five stars ? Suspicious ratings to me . Now that I have more experience I would be curious to check it out . But since I found a good solution I do n't think it 's worth the effort .	1
It 's well make and cheap compare with other product on Amazon nowadays market . I.I do replace it for guitar cable , work fine , I 'm happy with this unit . Recommend to someone need replace cable jct .	1
This is an all metal ( exc . for the adjusting screw ) stand , full-sizedfor 20 bucks . Exceptional value ! ! What more 's to say ?	1
First off , I 'd like to address any construction concerns . The nanoKontrol2 is actually sturdier than I imagined it would be , despite some of the reviews here . The case is rigid plastic , as are the rotary knobs and faders , and everything seems pretty solid ( I like the travel feel in the faders - not a lot of resistance , but not flimsy-feeling either ) . The buttons are soft , dense rubber , like a pad controller , and light up when they are pressed . If you have big hands , then you might have issues with using this as a live performance controller since everything is in such a compact space.The supplied mini USB cable fits nice and snug.Bottom line , if you take reasonable care with this unit , it seems like it should give you a lot of dependable service.I tried this right out of the box with Reason 7 - there is no built-in Reason template for it , but it was recognized by Reason when I did a controller surface scan , and it was a piece of cake to map the top knobs to pan controls and the faders to volume faders and the solo and mute buttons to their counterparts on the Reason mixer . Basically , I just bought this to do crossfades , and the nanoKontrol2 will be perfect for that , but I can also see using this to automate some softsynth parameters just as easily.Next , I set this up to control Peff 's Directre Rack Extension , and it 's a blast ! The transport buttons did correctly automap to Reason 's transport controls , so you can record , play , stop , fast forward and reverse from the nanoKontrol2.I did n't download the nanoKontrol2 editor yet , but that should increase the utility of this device.If the `` S '' , `` M '' and `` R '' buttons lit up in different colors ( all lights are red ) , it would make this unit more useful as a performance controller in my opinion , but as it stands , this budget mixer/performance control surface is well worth $ 50 !	1
These D'Addario silk and steel strings are excellent for finger picking . A couple of notes , though : ( 1 ) on the positive side , they are made in the U.S.A. of American-produced materials ( unlike silk and steel strings by a famous American guitar company whose name starts with `` M , '' which are assembled south of the border ) ; ( 2 ) on the negative side , they cost more than M -- -- - 's silk and steel strings ; ( 3 ) in general , silk and steel strings squeak more on position changes than straight steel strings , especially more than flat-wound acoustic strings ; ( 4 ) the tone is very nice and mellow , sort of a cross between flat-wound steel strings and nylon strings ; ( 5 ) the D'Addario folk set is very easy on the fingers and therefore are ideal if you play a lot , or if you primarily play a fairly light gauge electric string and only acoustic on occasion ; ( 6 ) they really work best for finger picking ( whatever you do , do n't use metal finger picks ) , and are less effective than steel strings for flat picking .	1
Other than being a little cheaply built it works great . I like the fold up into a small package idea . Room for a stand in the vehicle can be a problem for most of these types of stands . I can put this over the shoulder , carry my guitar and gigbag in one trip .	1
Needed a 6ft cable for home recording at my desk , all the other long ones would have made a mess under my feet , good thing there was this shorty . Nice cord , sturdy build , good sound . Electrons go through it and do n't leak out so it 's perfect i guess .	1
- it 's simple to operate- it does what it 's made to do- it does that very well- it 's bargaintasticIf you know what a noise gate is supposed to do and you think you might need one , then I highly recommend this unit.I 'm about to get a second one and put all my distortion-creating devices in the loop ( other Behringer units , Rat , Big Muff , etc etc ) . The one I already have can stay at the end of my signal chain , just before the delays . Pretty much a must-have for recording , especially during those quiet spots : - ) Thanks to this unit I have a very quiet recording setup .	1
If you want a strap for $ 5 you ca n't expect the moon . I bought this along with 2 other straps of higher price . This is simple . I would not want to use it with a tank top on ( or for guys on skin ) because it is stiff and not `` comfy '' but it is practical and works well . The leather ends fit securely on to my guitar snaps . Both ends are the same - leather . ( one of my straps has a string on the end - this kind does not - it is made for the snaps ) No bells or whistles but I would recommend it for the price .	1
I use a late 70 's yamaha steel string with this going into an LR Baggs Para DI and it works amazingly well . The sound is impeccable . But you ca n't expect to just plug it in and go . You 'll need a feedback buster and a good preamp . But it really does the job , good tone .	1
I have a black composite acoustic guitar and this little pickholder stays stuck right where the neck meets the body . People watching me ca n't really see it , and it 's right where I need it , full of picks , if I drop one . Wonderful little invention . Buy it , if you do n't want to carry a mess of picks in your guitar case or pocket .	1
it didnt hold as many i as thought ( it only holds 8 ) but that didnt matter , now i finaly have some where to put my picks so i dont lose them.the pick holder also has a sticky thing at the bottom so you can stick it to your guitar or somthing .	1
Made of quality material . I do not need anything fancy , because I am a simle person ! It does a first class job on my vintage electric guitar !	1
It looks nice , it 's really really long and it 's made strong but you could also use it for slicing skin and maybe a whip . After throwing it into the washing machine 3x with lots of softener , rubbing it with lard , dirt and baby powder , then soaking it over night . It 's finally soft and I could play naked without slicing off my head ! So buy it and prepare to really abuse it for a few days to soften it up !	1
I am forever meeting people who rave about this harp , but had not tried one for myself until today . It is a wonderful harp , with perfect tuning , easy bend-ability , does not buzz or squeak , and belies it 's reasonable sale price . I went for the Key of Bb , and love the tone , the playability and the just right feel of the instrument . For anyone not yet having a Special 20 , I heartily recommend it - beginner , intermediate or advanced students , or the performer on stage - this harp is simply great . I am not often surprised by anything but this harp surprised me - it is not expensive at all , and sounds as good as others I have that are four times the price . I am a Hohner Marine Band Special Twenty convert - I will get a couple more to add to my ever growing box of harps .	1
if you have never recorded vocals with a pop filter you do n't know what you are missing . This one works well , gets rid of a lot of the little sounds and all the pops . only bad thing is when it doesnt stay in place , but its usually fine	1
Restrung my guitar with no problems . These were my first set of new strings so I dont really know what to fuss about hen comparing strings but these seem to work fine and have a great tone . I can really hear the difference between new and old strings . The strings are nice and smooth , and springy , very easy to press on .	1
This microphone feels well built from all metal construction and the XLR connector mates firmly with most cables . The included cable is light duty , but not bad if you treat it with respect.The mike exhibits rich vocal tone throughout the frequency range with resonant lows , smooth midrange and crisp highs . For almost any singer or announcer , this will be just what they need . The cardiod pattern reduces feedback and background noise , making it a nice announcers mike for corporate video production . The sound is unbelievable , especially at this price . For under twenty dollars , this Pyle-Pro mike ca n't be beat.One issue I have with this mike is when using it on a Tascam DR40 portable recorder with an XLR to XLR cable , the Tascam generates a digital pulsing noise into the input electronics . Both of my Pyle Pro mikes have the same problem , but both mikes work perfectly with any other device . The Tascam D40 is known for this noise issue , but usually not when using the XLR input .	1
This is a wonderful item that really works ! Arrived fast ! Having a great time making picks out of old credit and gift cards ! This makes a great gift item !	1
These are n't the dirt-cheap - these actually have some nicer connectors - mid-grade level . They are n't the cheap type with a rubber boot that pretends to be a strain-relief - these are screw on plastic bits with a more sturdy housing . Decent cables and are n't too expensive . Will buy again ...	1
Yes this product is simple and expensive enough to raise some eyebrows . But this tool is very well designed . It keeps the guitar from sliding and positions it at a nice angle for maintenance . In storage mode , the mat rolls up into the clear plastic tube and takes up very little space . The bottom cover doubles as a storage compartment for your hex wrenches , string winder , and feeler guages.But the real reason I give this product five stars is because it allows me to work on my guitars while keeping them in perfect condition . That increases their resale value , so the tool pays for itself . And it gives me a lot of pleasure to have the right tools for the job . With the right tools , I enjoy working on my guitars almost as much as playing them . While I hear what those complaining of the high cost are saying , I am used to paying higher prices for good tools and I think this qualifies as a good tool . I used it to put new pickups in and setup my Squier Stratocaster last night without damaging my guitar . Without this tool , I do n't think I would have been so lucky .	1
Holy buckets of tone batman ! Let me start by saying , I 'm always on the quest for great amazing tone . I think it ends here . This pedal is absolutely remarkable . Built like a tank , I 'm pretty sure it will out live me . Its full of sonic options.The overdrive has a level , tone and overdrive . Almost self explanatory except the tone is more of a presence knob and less of an EQ which is a total plus in my book . it also has a mini toggle for comp cut , fm , and vintage modes . The comp cut is more of a clean boost to push your amps front end , the fm is really transparent , and the vintage mode gets you that creamy midrange bite.Yes , this may be another tube screamer clone , but it 's a darn great one.The added MOSFET circuitry toggle gives it a lovely growl your low-end fattening it up , if thats your cup of tea , while the standard leaves it more transparent . You should know this switch does effect the whole signal , not just that of the boost side.On to my only negative check on this pedal , the boost ONLY works when the OD is on . It is not a boost to be run in series with the overdrive , just additional circuitry to add more gain to your OD signal.Another great feature , this pedal can be run at different volts from 9v-18v.Running at standard 9v gets you easier breakup , whereas 18v will get you more headroom.This pedal wo n't be leaving my board , probably ever . If you 're even thinking about it , just do it ! ! ! You 'll never regret it .	1
I use this on my spider iv 75 it works great I 've had it for about 2 months and no issues .	1
Works great right out of the box . Easy to use and accurate . A must have for any guitar player . Turn it on , clip it on and tune .	1
There seems to be a lot of know it alls when it comes to this case . One reviewer says it 's made by Fender . I seriously doubt that and have to wonder on what he bases that on . Show me proof . Someone else seems to think it 's made by Epiphone . Sorry to disappoint you but Epiphone does n't make cases . They accept bids from case manufacturers who can build a case to thier specifications at the lowest cost . I have several Epiphone 335 Dots and a Gibson ES335 . I bought Epiphone cases for all of them . I found the Gibson case to be identical except for the color of the lining and the logo on the outside of the case . I could n't see any sense in paying more money just for the Gibson name . My Gibson fits perfectly in the Epiphone case . Although the cases have the Epiphone logo on the outside , they are all made by TKL . How do I know that you 're wondering ? They have a TKL tag on the inside of the accessory compartment . That 's been a few years ago . The cases you get now could be made by a different company . The case is very heavy and is actually heavier than the guitar . Regardless of who actually makes the case , it has to meet Epiphone 's manufacturing standards so it 's got to be good . This case will fit The 335 Dot , Casino , Sheraton and the Gibson ES335 . Anyone who knows anything about guitars knows that the Epiphone Joe Pass Emperor II has a much thicker body than the 335 Dot . This case was not intended for the Emperor II . It 's a great case and will protect your guitar , but it 's not designed to be thrown from a rooftop or run over by a car . I just bought two more of these cases for my Harmony Rockets . One is a single cutaway reissue and the other is a vintage double cutaway . Both guitars fit perfectly .	1
D'Addario ALWAYS puts out a nice product . The E and B strings never have enough coating , but still . In comparison to others , they do a good job of getting the music out there in a bright and sustained manner .	1
All the parts I buy an Amazon have been checks out before I buy them and they have been compared with other companies , and I found these parts are the best price and quality compared to other outlets I repair and rebuild guitars as a hobby and I am satisfied with these parts johnJ .	1
This pedal is very easy to use ! Retro sound is rich with harmonics- does have the Marshall sound- very satisfied !	1
I 've bought three of these now - this is an awesome , well made case that fits just about any superstrat guitar easily . The most recent was for something rather unique ( a fanned fret , compound scale eight string ) and that guitar also fit perfectly with plenty of room to spare.There are more expensive options out there , but for a non-fitted `` do it all '' case , this is the best bang for your buck hands down . I am comfortable using it to carry any of my guitars , from the inexpensive ones to the high end customs . Great case , great price .	1
Based on other reviews , I made my purchase . This is a great unit , it sounds good and loud enough.Two downsides , both are about the noise.1 . I live on the 4th floor . As long as I turn the volume up , it acts like a radio.. I mean very loud radio background and I could n't get ride of it . This is the only thing that annoys me , but I think it depends on where people live.2 . When this is not properly tuned , it sounds strange and makes a lot of noise . ( Other than the radio part . ) None of these are major issues , as a mini amp you ca n't really expect that much , not to mention it 's not expensive at all . Overall I like it and I would recommend it.By the way , this unit comes with a 9V battery .	1
This is the first guitar pick I ever played with and to this day is my favorite type . Nice and thin and flexible , but not so flexible that you ca n't bend it for single picking . I 'm torn between this style , out of nostalgia , and the blue version-because I love blue .	1
The only flaw is the rubber gaskets in the joints These deteriorate over 3 or 4 years . I go through these quite a bot but for $ 20- $ 30 you ca n't go wrong . Tubes are tough and sturdy	1
I buy Elixirs with all my acoustic guitars now . They last the longest and hold the brightest and clearest tone of any string I 've ever used . The nanoweb coating really does make a huge difference . They take several months to wear out ( as opposed to the weeks other major brands last ) . They may cost a bit more than the competition , but if you try them and love them as much as I do , you 'll never use anything else again .	1
For years I have fell more and more in love with my Yamaha CGX-111SC . Stil , nylon acoustic guitars have this weird sound when played on open spaces without using the piezo ( note : change to a better piezo system , LR Baggs are great ! ) , high notes were lost in the thin air covered by the lower notes . I wanted to experiment with this item ... result : GREAT ! ! ! I finally got to listen to what I use to heard from the recordings at controlled environments . The sound is richer and clarity makes unique .	1
I bought this pickup for placement in two ukeleles I own.The first ukelele was a Lanakai LU-21 . It installed pretty easily , except the adhesive lost its adhesion after I moved the pickup to a new location within the soundbox . I need to get some stronger carpet tape or new adhesive to secure it more permanently in its new location . It sounded great though -- several people commented on how loud and sweet the instrument sounded through a guitar amplifer and also through a mixer , amp and PA system . We did have to boost the gain on the mixer significantly to get adequate volume , but we were able to project enough sound to do a dance for about 100 people . Straight into a guitar amp , it gave plenty of volume.Happy with the results , I then installed a second one in a Mahalo painted/economy ukelele available here on Amazon . The installation went well except the endpin jack would n't `` stay put '' in the sound hole . On my Lanakai this was not a problem -- there is a ragged washer which goes on the inside of the endpin jack which is supposed to bite into the wood on the inside of the instrument . It is supposed to stop the endpin jack from turning when you screw on a strap pin/bolt onto the endpin jack from the outside of the instrument . On the Lanakai , this ragged-edged washer bit into the softer mahogany-like wood easily and did its job very well . On the Mahalo , which is a smooth maple or pine , the ragged washer could n't bite into the wood . As a result , the endpin jack turned and turned when I tried to screw on the outer bolt/strap button and never went on tight enough . I had to put masking tape around the end pin jack to make it fit snugly in the hole I created in the end block of the ukelele . THEN there was enough resistance to allow me to install the strap button/end bolt very tightly.My biggest beef with this unit is the fact that it takes a 15/32 hole to fit it snugly in the ukelele . This is an odd size , so you end up using a 7/16 drill bit which is common in most handyman drill bit sets . Because this is too small , you have to make the hole 1/32 '' larger by whatever means you have available . This was an agonizingly slow process when I tried to do it by hand , using a dowel with sandpaper wrapped around it . A peg-hole reamer might have done a better job , but I did n't have one.So , I eventually found a dowel and glued some sandpaper to it , shoved it in my drill press , and slowly lifted my 7/16 '' hole in the ukelele into the spinning sanpaper dowel . This took care of the sizing problem in a matter of seconds , although it was not a really tight fit , and necessitated the use of masking tape around the endpin jack in the Mahalo to stablize it in the hole.Also , the directions do n't tell you much about the placement of the 3 nuts , 2 flat washers , ragged washer , and strap button/bolt that goes on the end of the jack . I did it his way , starting from the inside of the ukelele : ( Bolt1-Bolt2-thin washer-ragged washer ) -- WALL OF THE UKELELE -- ( outer thick washer , outer bolt3 , outer strap pin/bolt ) . The purpose of bolt1 is to stabilize bolt2 . This sequence of pieces worked on both instruments in which I installed the pickup.Overall , when played through different guitar amps , as well as a mixer/amp/PA system , I was pleased with the results of this unit in a ukelele . I would buy another if I needed to amplify yet another accoustic instrument .	1
I bought these to try them out . I have used remo a little then I used to have some Aquarian heads and wanted to try Evans to see how they are . Amazing . I practically beat the crap out of them and the held up . My next acoustic drumset will have Evans on them .	1
I 've been trying to get a specific sound for quite a while now . This pedal completed that task . It 's hard to describe the sound that this pedal provides but it is perfect . Very punchy and crisp . You ca n't go wrong with Behringer pedals . They are plastic though , so they might not hold up under heavy road use , but for home studios they are perfect . Highly recommended .	1
I bought my son a thousand dollar Epiphone limited edition electric guitar for his birthday just a few months ago , so when he told me he would like an acoustic guitar for Christmas , I told him an expensive one was not in our budget.We went to the local music store and tried out several models but he kept coming back to this one . The sound was absolutely fabulous , much better than his current acoustic guitar that cost more than twice as much as this one.The store manager told us that for the price this guitar can not be beat and that he bought one for his son as well . In my opinion , this was as good as other brands costing three times as much . I 'm not sure how Takamine is making these quality guitars for so little money , but if you 're looking for a starter guitar , or just looking to add another guitar to your collection , this would make an excellent choice.I inspected the guitar we took home and found a few places where the finish was not quite as smooth as the rest of the guitar , but overall the quality and sound can not be beat for this price.We also went with this cutaway version so my son can have easier access to the higher frets vs. theJasmine by Takamine S35 Acoustic Guitar , Natural .	1
very awesome item . really useful for tuning . have n't had any problems with it at all so far . Looks very nice	1
Great pedal , but if you pull it open and put in a couple of cheap mods , this thing is absolutley rediculous ! It 's a boutique pedal with only a little time and solder .	1
Not too light and bendy , not too heavy and stiff , these picks are just right . Dunlop also makes quality picks , and I have yet to break one of these . They last a long time . I am a guy so at first I wished they were n't purple , but since Dunlop only codes their sizes with certain colors I like them so much I do n't really care what color they are anymore . I bought a pack of these picks for much less money at my local music store so I would recommend looking there first . Now please stop cutting up milk jugs and go buy these . Now !	1
Used the 9-42 's for years but thought I would give these a try . Fuller sound with the 10-46 's butI can not bend them like the 9 's . I have switched back on a few of then guitars for variety : 10 's for rhythm and finger style , 9 's for lead . Get the packs of single 9 's and 10 's too so that when one breaks you dont have to steal from another whole set .	1
Very simple device to connect a quality dynamic microphone ( or instrument using a direct box ) to the USB input of a computer . I plugged in my mic and plugged the cable into my PC . Win 7 automatically searched for and found the drivers in about three minutes . I then recorded some vocals using Audacity , a free open source download . Recording was whisper quiet with no background hiss or noise at all . Recording level was great , not sure why some reviewers said it was too low . Note that this will not provide phantom power , nor does the item description imply that it will . USB only provides 5VDC and phantom power usually requires 18-48VDC . Unless there is some kind of power converter ( which would be much too large to fit in this compact package ) it is impossible for this or any similar sized cable to provide the higher voltage that phantom power requires . Use this with a dynamic mic or direct box and if you use it correctly you will be very happy !	1
this is a simple loop effects pedal which makes awesome quality loops and unlimited dubs . you can jam for hours with this thing , it 's awesome .	1
This little beast works great for guitars or basses in loud or soft environments . Just clip it to your headstock and tune up in under 30 seconds . I 've even used it on the bell of my trumpet to tune up to pitch.Pros : - Dead-on accurate . You can easily set your intonation with this little monster.- Works great in extremely loud environments.- Clips on tightly . If you do n't jump around like an orangutan on stage , you could probably have the Snark ride your headstock through the whole show.- You do n't have to plug into it.- Extremely responsive.- Enough display detail for you to know when you 're getting close to in tune -- not just 3 indicators like some tuners ( flat , dead-on , sharp ) .- Very inexpensive.Cons : - A little twitchy on the open low B string on bass . I use the 12th fret harmonics ( first partial ) to tune , however , since it 's a purer tone that seems to resonate in the headstock more , so this has never really been a problem for me.Inexpensive enough to keep one in every gig bag or case -- for every instrument you own .	1
This pedal provides the classic octave distortion I sought after . For the price and product quality you ca n't go wrong with this one . And the functionality is great ! Use it as a fuzz/distortion independently or switch on the octave up for the classic Jimi Hendrix like tones and harmonics	1
What makes a good cable ? One that works . I 've had these XLR cables fail because the pins get loose , so I hope this does n't happen to this one .	1
Got to admit I was a little intimidated by the installation process when I was shopping for this pickup . But when I got the box I was pleasantly suprised to find excellent instructions ( not too long , not too short ) along with plenty of supplies to complete the instillation properly . The jig method is super easy and provided great results . I was really excited to try out the pickup so I plugged it into my Roland AC-33 and let her rip , it was awsome , very full and very representative of my guitars sound . K & K you have a convert in me . I am now thinking about trying this on my Martin !	1
Hands down , in my opinion these are by far the best guitar straps you can get . I have a few of planet waves different designs for these , all on my electrics . I have an acoustic-electric Ibanez but the strap would n't fit , however the strap was n't purchased for the acoustic - I was just trying it on all of my different guitars for reviewers sake.If you 're considering buying this , just do it .	1
Not a drop in replacment for many Fenders . I installed these on a Fender Marauder and needed to drill holes in the head stock . You ca n't see it really well in the picture but there is a metal plug on the bottom next to the screw hole that needs a hole to fit into.I sweat some bullets and used the smallest drill bit I own , and stuck a piece of tape 1mm from the tip so I would n't drill too deep . It is important to make the hole STRAIGHT in line from the screw hole so they do n't go on crooked . I also had to drill the screw holes about 2mm deeper because the screws that come with this go deeper into the headstock.Now that they 're installed I can attest that the guitar holds it 's tune better and it 's easier to tune . Before it would not respond for many pegs until twisted too far then it would suddenly break lose and be too sharp/flat . That happens far less now .	1
light construction but you get what you pay for . so far it has functioned well and I do use it a lot . it would be nice if it remembered what channel it was last on so when you power cycle it doesnt switch on you . I mostly use it to feed one amp from two different instruments . I have not noticed any sound degradation from using it . the volume knobs are handy for sure ! !	1
I bought this since I am a new guitar player ... It does hit the frets but does n't seem to do any damage ... Pretty easy to use.The only oddity I have is that the box was kind of open already when I bougt it new.Does the job .	1
Simple , but elegant in size for placement in a guitar case . This a great device to put my genuine 'Planet Waves ' signature picks in . Michael Haller , 'Captain Soul 's Sound Circus '	1
So I am a big fan of the SM57 Microphone as a vocal mic due to its ease of recording and good sound quality.I have a bunch of the Large Style Condenser Microphones ( Rode NT1-A , AT2020 , SP C-1 ) and they are clear , but so sensitive that it 's difficult to get a solid performance and mix without them either clipping or picking up everything in the room . So if you 're like me andlike to let go a bit when you sing , you should try a Dynamic Mic for the wide range and forgiveness they can giveyou when you belt a little.I did an A / B test against the SM7B I just bought and the SM57 ( I love ) for vocals - with the exact same processing chain , cable , settings , etc . and just switched the mics out . I sung the same passage as well , and I have to say - the SM57 sounds muddy in comparison to the SM7B . If I did n't have this new microphone I would still like the SM57 , but the Genni is out of the bottle now ... so not going back . The SM7B is clear and sounds sweet in comparison and still handles the vocal sound dynamics very well.DYNAMIC SINGERS ( Rock , Jazz , GOSPEL , OPERA ) = If you have the budget get this SM7B and if you do n't , buy the SM57 until you do have the budget.QUIET SINGERS ( ACOUSTIC , FOLK ) = If you sing softly all of the time you really do n't need one of these dynamic mics , and would be better off with the standard Large Condenser mics as listed above . Of those type , I like the Studio Projects C-1 Best I think , but they are close .	1
First , let me start by saying this pedal has been part of my setup for nearly 7 years now and still looks/sounds as great as the day it came out of the box.Its a Boss product , which means you are going to pay for what you get . You get the best bang for your buck with Boss products . Solid , rugged construction that is built to last ( no chance of breaking one of these things ) and an outstanding analog stomp box with a genuine sound . Good customer support as well and if you ever feel you need to sale your Boss pedal , resale prices are always good.While this pedal is capable of hundreds of tones and sounds ( chorus is one of the most useful and versatile effects in my opinion ) Here are some of the best uses I have found.1 . Tweak the pedal just to thicken your sound and give that 2 guitar effect . Perfect if you want to fatten up that really heavy chorus in a song and make it sound really full.2 . Dime out the speed and depth for those crazy out of this world Korn type effects . This is a really handy pedal for imitating tones of other bands because it can do so much . There are a lot of bands tones I can come close to exactly matching , tones that took them 2 or 3 pedals to achieve.3 . Liquify your sound and give a beautiful tone to cleans and leads . This pedal will help simple parts that would normally go unoticed stand out . If you play any kind of Christian music you will soon learn it does n't matter what you do as long as you put chorus on it . Walking in on Sunday morning and turn out some Slayer while using a chorus pedal and they will go nuts . Chorus is just one of those effects no matter what type of music you are playing , you will always find a use for it , so there is no excuse for not adding this pedal to your rig.In addition you have some great features , easy access battery compartment , accepts a 9v power supply , works well with both guitar and bass , 2 out puts so you can run to 2 sources if desired , and all the controls you need to really be in complete control . You HAVE to get this pedal !	1
This Power-Grip Pedalboard Mounting Tape is VELCRO ON STEROIDS ! ! ! This product makes your pedals SUPER SECURE . The tape backing is first rate heavy adhesive and the gripping & # 34 ; teeth & # 34 ; would make The & # 34 ; JAWS & # 34 ; shark envious.Word of advice ; Make sure you have your pedals arranged the exact way that you want them before you start mounting them to the board . Once down you can pretty much count on an ALMOST PERMENT MOUNTING.And a hint ; Some pedals ( like Behringer ) have a rubber bottom . Remove these rubber & # 34 ; non-skid & # 34 ; plates because they come off too easily.Also ; AMAZON sells & # 34 ; couplers & # 34 ; . These take less room and cut down on the clutter.As a matter of fact , AMAZON sells EVERY THING YOU NEED to put together a Pro Board .	1
While the sound improvement is not huge with my guitar , it did n't need to be . When it comes to music , it is & # 34 ; that little extra & # 34 ; that makes the difference . The Planet Waves O-Ports gives me that extra . I have no doubt it will continue to please me for many , many years to come .	1
Cheap and good texture rubber that does not get stiff . Only time will tell how well the soldering is . Sounds fine to me .	1
Very very good product ! I have no complains about it . Definitely a great buy and a Must have in your pedalboard .	1
I was n't expecting much for the price but have to admit I 'm very pleased with the tone these strings produce straight out of the package . After several hours of play and 2 tunings , they 're spot on and sound sweet as cream butter . Great product and very highly recommend	1
Tone is subjective . I have little experience with tube voodoo . So all I can say is that it is working well for me . I would buy again .	1
There is n't much to say about this product , except it works as advertised . If you do n't have one of these and you are a live performer , I highly recommend you pony up the few dollars and pick one up ( pun intended ) .	1
These are Good cables at a good price ! ! Not sure they would hold up to heavy use , but for practicing at home they are really great !	1
I bought this little pedal back in 1996 , about a year after I got my first guitar . I 've tried other pedals , but ultimately , this one gives me the best sound . It 's very versatile and it 's really easy to dial in just about any sound I want . You might get a more dramatic effect from expensive rack units , but for cost and practicality , this pedal is your best bet !	1
produce is great price and good quality . it is just the right size to hold my mandolin while I play .	1
The Alpha is a great little interface . It accepts 2 inputs with 2 outputs going into your computer . It 's powered via the USB . The & # 34 ; mix & # 34 ; knob is a nice feature , allowing you to hear your input more or less prominently within the playback mix without affecting the input to the DAW . I 'm using cakewalk 's Music Creator 6 Touch so I did n't bother to load the LE software it came with . I like cakewalk 's software better anyways ( just my preference ) . Some reviewers have commented on hearing a hiss from the unit while recording . I have n't had a problem with this . It is extremely silent save any noise I would generate anyway from my rig . All in all I feel this is a great product and definitely worth the money .	1
I ordered this because I have an Ovation , and none of the clip on tuners were able to get a good grip on that kind of headstock.Due to the small size and adjustable clip , this tuner fit perfectly , and well out of the way . It took me a few tries to get used to pushing up on the ON/OFF button , but no problem now.As a tuner , I really like it . The small green screen is easy to read in low or regular light ( have n't tried it in bright light yet ) , the bars for fine tuning are pretty stable , and it did a great job in a noisy gig , where I changed tunings about 10 times during the evening .	1
Ernie Ball 2223 Super Slinky Electric Strings -.009-.042 set is very good opportunity to replace the original strings on your new guitar.Recommend it .	1
They 're just great . Awesome for chord based songs . If you need to pick individual notes/strings , then you might want to go a bit thicker . With that said , you can do it with these , but the tone is not as nice ( sounds a bit softer ) .	1
I 've got several capos , from the highest end models to the cheapest , and this one is every bit as good as the expensive ones , with ease of use and solid build quality . Why spend more ? ? Just buy it , and stop over paying for your capos forever more !	1
This stand does its job quite well . The only problem I can foresee anyone having , is there are no instructions on the proper way to unfold it . It 's not a difficult problem to solve though , so be patient and all will work out . **** Update****I just want to add that the seller of this item went above and beyond , as far as customer service . I have nothing but praise for them !	1
This Capo is inexpensive and works well . Clips on easily and hold strings down nicely . What more can I say . Got ta keep it simple on this review because it 's a simple item . Simply , it does what it 's supposed to do for a low price . I think it will last a while too but I 'll probable misplace it before it breaks anyway so I have a few of these floating around . You should have one of these in each gig bag .	1
This pop filter is built like a tank compared to those cheap cloth and plastic versions that you get at the discount music stores , so it 's a bit more expensive , but the quality and functionality is like night and day . I use it in front of my Shure Beta 58A , and it 's absolutely perfect .	1
I do n't use the other features , but as a tuner , this product is spot on . Filters out noise well when using the mic . Only two things to gripe with - 1 . The leg that you can use to prop this up is n't very usable . and 2 . It 's not great for gig use as the screen is n't that readable.As a home tuner or for a brightly-lit gig - excellent !	1
I never really had an issue with tuning stability with the stock tuners on my American Standard Strat . What interested me the most was the easy string changes and locking tuners have really helped with that . But I have noticed that it does stay in tune better than before . These are easy to install and simple to use . All you need is a 10mm socket and your are set . As others have pointed out , these are staggered so there are 3 long ones and 3 short ones so you need to make sure you get them on the right way . It only took a couple of minutes to install and they fit like a glove . I 've read some people complaining about the additional weight on the headstock but I do n't even notice the difference . They work just like genuine Fender parts would be expected .	1
These are slightly larger diameter than the original pins were . This is exactly what I wanted since my 1973 acoustic guitar has been restrung so many times that the bridge pin holes were getting loose enough that the original plastic pins were very low and difficult to grab and pull out . These new pins fit those holes perfectly and make stringing my guitar a pleasure , again ! And there is also a noticeable improvement in the sound , over that produced by the plastic pins .	1
This little device is more than worth the money . I run a Behringer EUROPOWER PMP1280S Powered Mixer into the Behringer 1202 12 channel desktop mixer ( $ 80 ) into the UCA202 into my computer . The recording is awesome . My recording playback sounds like its live.I use a lot of Behringer equipment and no , I do n't work for Behringer . I 'm on a budget . That means little money.My friends say , `` Duh , oh , well , Behringer is built cheap and is junk . '' And I say , `` Duh , huh , really ? I 've got better sound than you , a lot more equipment to power my show , it has never broken down , and I paid a LOT less than you did . `` In fact , I use Behringer XM8500 mics ( 3 pack for $ 60 ) . I was playing a gig at a small pub . A friend who swears by Sure mics asked if he could do a song on my break . I said sure . When he was done , he said , I LOVE this mic . The sound is awesome . Nuff said .	1
lovely strings for rhythm guitarist , special i 'm using it for reggae skanks rhythm and it sounds warm and scream ... thanks	1
I tried another mini-amps but all sounds like toys . This is totally different , it 's the real thing . Made of wood , very good looking and powerfull sound . The only thing I do n't like is that it 's hard to get clean tones from it , and with a Les Paul it 's harder , beside that , it 's perfect .	1
I see mixed reviews here . At this price , no telling what the quality control is like but as I wrote in another review on this type of item , you can buy 3 of these and if one fails , you 're still ahead of the game . They 're so much less expensive than what one will typically find in a guitar or electronics store , well worth taking a chance . Mine seems to be fine , does n't look or feel flimsy at all . I ca n't see any difference between this and what I buy in a retail package .	1
I bought it to tune my guitars and my banjo , it works good on all of them and is very accurate . I also used it to tune my uncle 's mandolin for him because he could n't find his tuner . Other than that theres not much else to say : P , I have n't used the metronome so I ca n't comment on that .	1
I bought this to restore the neck of an Ibanez that I had ordered used and knew needed TLC.After a few coats of this stuff the neck looked/played/felt like it was just out of the factory ! It restored years of neglect in just a few minutes.When I bought this I though it would n't be enough . BOY WAS I WRONG . I 'll have enough of this oil to last me awhile which makes me happy because I can get that new guitar feel out of my neck for months if not years to come .	1
For the price this is a pretty nice strap . It 's thin but does the job well . The simulated leather end pieces are noticeably & # 34 ; cheap & # 34 ; but its a guitar strap and has not failed me yet : )	1
This item was purchased because I 'm doing self-teaching on the fiddle . I figured it would be a good idea to have this to train my fingers while I 'm learning . Since I 'm used to fretted instruments this helps me visualize where my fingers should go . I like that it has the different colors for the different finger positions . I also like that it has perferations along the template so you can put as much or as little of the indicator on the fingerboard as you want.It did take some measuring to get this in place . I had to be very careful to put it on squarely . The closer I got to the bridge the more difficult it got and it was a little out of line , but not so much that it would affect how to use the template.One things I had to deal with was to make sure I had a MM measuring devise . The bridge of the violin had to be 325 mm from the nut . It took some doing , but I was finally able to get the bridge in the correct position in order to make sure the fred indicator would give me the correct notes .	1
Bought as a stocking stuffer for my brother in law . Gave it to him with an actual replica of the pick . He loved them . Still has some .	1
This is a very simple product , and , as others have stated , you could probably just 'DIY ' one pretty easily ... .but for this price , why bother ? ? ? Under $ 10 and this thing is as good as ones that range from $ 20-50 . I do n't think the material + the time it is going to take for you to make one ( about 30 mins-an hour , more if you have to go out and buy all of the materials ) is going to be worthwhile versus just ordering this bad boy online and ... voila ! It arrives two days later , no fuss no muss ( assuming you have Prime , because , well , who does n't these days ? ; ) ) PLUS this will look good on camera .	1
This shape give the strumming hand a better grip on the pick . I sand a bit from one of the points to give it a shape more like the classic heart-shaped Fender pick . The stock rounded point dulls the attack on the string . Good for strumming rhythm , not so hot for lead .	1
I use this stand to hold my yamaha electric guitar.It works perfectly.Super stable and doesnt take up much space.For the price I do n't think it can be beat .	1
Love Elixir strings ! I bought my first pack , over 7 years ago and I 've been hooked . They last , at least , twice as long as traditional copper wound strings , and sound even better . GET THESE ! These make my cheap $ 50 acoustic guitar , sound almost as good as my Martin ... no kidding .	1
People tell you you need to buy a 1000 dollar tube amp to sound good..shuuut up..mic this through a PA and you ; re set never need another amp againUse amp modeling software that fender includes and you have a vast array of tones..for 100 bucks..Spend money on a top end guitar if you get this amp its all you need	1
these strings sound really great and have that special nanoweb coating that is resistant to corrosion and rusting like other strings tend to get as they age . the extra light gauge sound so bright and happy on my acoustic- which is very old and tired looking.. but sounds brand new when i throw these strings on it . very much recommended.. acoustic and elixir electric strings as well .	1
This music package by Led Zepplin is historical and put together well . Great for any Zep fan . Great audio and video . I especially liked the unreleased version of For Your Life !	1
For the money there is n't a better tuner on the market today . This is the newer version which some have complained about the tuning lines being thicker , really ? This tuner is s [ pot on every time and super fast . You can move from string to string quick .	1
Just got this in this week . Looks nice and works as intended . For 22 bucks , ca n't really go wrong . I use this with a Behringer C1 and have had no trouble getting it to fit . It 's a bit snug , but I would prefer a snug fit over a loose fit .	1
Throw this right in my little storage bag I use for my gigging materials ... microphones , cables , straps , tuner , etc . folds up easy , fits great . Seems stable enough .	1
My only criticism is that for the size of the screen the readout is reallysmall and a bit hard for an old blind man like myself to see .	1
First , I would be extremely wary of the durability of any piano bench for under $ 50 . Second , as a professional piano player I have never found a use for a traveling `` bench '' or `` stool . '' Think about it : you 've got a heavy keyboard to haul plus an amp plus a keyboard stand and maybe a music stand , electric light and music , perhaps even a storage case for the cables , adapters , extra fuses , batteries , tuners , sometimes an extra keyboard or two , or a couple of tone generators with MIDI cables , or , if you still pack a Rhodes , spare tines and a pair of wire cutters -- and you 're going to add a bench ( ! ) to your weekly moving equipment caravan ? In 90 % of the locations that I 've worked , I 'm able to locate a plain chair without arms ( usually the kitchen crew knows where the house spartan chair can be found ) . Not only does it reduce by one the paraphernalia , but it helps protect against the body structure problems to which piano players , especially , are prone over the course of thousands of hours of slouching , subjecting finger joints to unhealthy amounts of pressure , too caught up in chords and scales and retrieving half-remembered melodies to register the physical-neurological effects until after the job . I 've always envied the lounge act players who can stand while playing -- far better for the entire musculature configuration of the human anatomy ( not to mention prostate ) . In fact , if the club or restaurant has a regular piano bench or one of those padded , rising and lowering black Steinway cushions , try to replace it with a plain chair without arms . Especially if you 're doing 4-hour gigs , sometimes two in the same day , you 'll notice the difference short and long term.Bottom line , your back needs more pampering than your bottom , which is why you need a seat with a back . Only concert artists like Horowitz and Rubenstein could get away with those cushy Steinway stools -- 30 minutes to complete the concerto and be done with it ( actually most of the stress was gone upon completion of the cadenza of the first movement ) . Some of us are n't that lucky -- or gifted -- or smart .	1
On the plus side it does the job , powers your 9V pedals and does n't break the bank ... on the down side this unit can be a bit noisy depending on which wall socket you have to plug into . Neon lighting can raise Hell with this power supply ... but who ever said playing out live was gon na be easy ? Best to have a noise gate handy ... just in case .	1
My son had his eye on a vintage harmonica that my great uncle used in Europe during WW I. Needless to say , I did not want to pass this on to him yet . I figured he could start simpler . I read the reviews of the harmonicas and saw nothing but positive about this instrument . It has a great tone . Its construction is solid . I am sure this will give him years of entertainment . This is not a toy - a great addition to your mouth harp collection .	1
Works well and has some nice features for extra tuning help . Comparing it to my old BOSS TU-12 dedicated guitar tuner , this works just as good .	1
This is a nice microphone stand . I have used it on several projects involving sound with no problems . I would purchase this again . It 's sturdy and gets the job done .	1
These just sound great . Huge upgrade from the stock factory strings on our beginner Ibanez electric guitar . Good stuff , will certainly come back for more when the time comes . Cheap for what you get , and a nice sonic upgrade with a great feel .	1
These strings are noticeably warmer compared to the brighter Bronze Nanoweb . Still a great guitar string . A real winner for Elixir who are the originators of & # 34 ; Goretex & # 34 ; A real triumph of re-invention . Well done Goretex !	1
Sound quality did improve over the plastic pegs . Next in line is to tweak my bridge by replacing the plastic saddle with a Tusq . This should improve my sustain and tone even more . If you 're looking for a budget increase of tone ... this is a way to go .	1
I say perfection , because this amp does exactly what I wanted it to do . It is also a great value for what it does . It offers ample volume for small venues . I love having two mic inputs and the CD input . The Behringer AT108 , along with my Fender amp , gives me plenty of performance capability .	1
I 've been swapping back and forth between Evans and Remo for a while , but after really liking the emad kick head I decided to lean more toward Evans just for consistency in my setup.I consulted with an online forum to find which would be the closest 'compatible ' drumhead to what I really liked from Remo on the Evans line , and I was led to the G2 series . ( from Remo 's Emperor series -- both being 2 plies of 7mm free floating film ) Honestly , I think I 'm going to stick with Evans from now on though ! I ordered my pack shortly after the announcement of the 'level 360 ' sizing , and I wanted to give them a try . My fears of getting some old stock were unfounded and the set that I got was new enough to be L360 sized.I got them on , and the tuning seemed to be pretty easy . I use a drum dial to ballpark me and start my tuning process , but it went smoothly . Not sure if it was the placebo effect , but I seemed to be able to get a little more low range on my floor tom as well -- deeper but just as resonant as an 808 kick.The coating seems to hold up better on the Evans heads as well -- Remo tends to 'flatten out ' within a few hours of play , where the Evans not only lasts longer , but has a more finished feel to them .	1
I read mixed reviews of this pedal board , but I had tried half a dozen multi effects pedals and modeling processors and pedals with limitless combinations all in one . However , I found all of those too difficult to adjust to my needs , or too cumbersome to flip through all the channels to get to the sound I wanted and then modify it . What I wanted was four or five single effects pedals that I could preset to the value I usually use and then turn on each effect as needed , giving me lots of combinations . I had a couple of Boss pedals and one Behringer one and I ordered a couple more of the inexpensive Behringer units , which I 'm generally pleased with , though they 're perhaps not in the elite category . They work fine for me . I did n't want 5 or 6 units cluttering up the space and each demanding its own wall wart.This compact board with its built in case and cord management was the perfect solution for me . Instead of the Velcro found on many boards , this has foam cutouts which hold the B and B pedals securely and give enough room for the connectors and daisy chain power supply to stay tangle free . It all plugs in with one adapter ( provided ) and it also comes with all the short connectors to connect each pedal together.My pedals are incredibly easy to use and extremely well organized now . The case holds them securely and the lid fits on and holds everything in place for transport . Everything is ready to play by just removing the lid and plugging into the outlet.The latches are not the most secure , just a simple plastic slide that looks like it could easily break . However , there are matching holes right next to them so a small lock or even a twist tie could be inserted if the latch does malfunction.Overall , I 'm extremely satisfied . If you 're doing something similar to me , I 'm sure you will be too . The foam cutouts can be manipulated for other sizes of pedals . I have exactly enough to fill it , with the addition of a dedicated tuner that mutes everything while I tune .	1
I use is this mount to support a Samson meteor mic . It works great . I would definitely buy this again . The mounting is designed to work on any diameter microphone stand . It has good positive adjustments even with a heavy mic on the end .	1
Title says it all I guess , it gives you the small pick feeling without the thickness ( that I 'm not crazy about in Dunlops ) , and the traction is certainly better in my oversweating hands . Bought these 3 months ago and I 've got to say they 're very durable too , certainly more so than the small-pick alternatives I tried .	1
This cable disproves the notion that you get what you pay for . It 's quality outweighs its price . Let 's face it , a cable is a cable is a cable . But the quality of these cables can vary greatly . I replaced a lighter cable with this one and I was surprised at the difference in the quality of the sound from my amp . I have an Ibanez ART series guitar into an Ibanez 15 watt amp set up in my home . With nothing changed but the cable , there was a significant difference in quality and volume . So much so that I checked with my guitar teacher who said he was not surprised . The quality appears good . The ends are heavy duty and the little bit of hum I had due to the proximity of everything was attenuated to the point where it was inconsequential . I 've seen more expensive cables and this one is ( so far ) great.Hosa GTR210 Guitar Cable 10 Ft	1
Now , this is one GREAT piece of kit . Two chanels , 60 watts RMS ( real power ) , and super control over the sound of each channel . Only complaint ? IT 'S BUH-TUGLY ! Sickly brown ... cheesy looking . If she was my prom date , I 'd put a sack over her head ( yeah , well , not that I 'm another George Clooney or anything ) .	1
Purchased these strings after having tried Blue Steel strings on my son 's acoustic guitar . He prefers the Elixir strings over the Blue Steel strings . He says they last a lot longer and sound better , too .	1
I plugged it in the outlet . Plugged it into my Fender Mini Tone-master Amp . I do n't need to worry about batteries any more .	1
The D'Addario sets are good stuff . I got turned onto them about a decade ago by a coworker . The color coded ends are great whether you are new at changing strings or just want it more automated if you are an old veteran . With stretching , they stay in tune fine . The unknown truth about non-nylon strings ( and maybe even them , too ) is that there are only a handful of string makers , and D'Addario actually makes them for other companies ( Gore uses them for their Elixir series , and just adds the polyweb coating ) . I also use the GHS standard .010 sets , and they are good too . My faves are the Ernie Ball sets , but they rarely go on sale . I do n't remember who makes what strings for what companies , though . With offshore production a standard thing now , it 's no telling where they actually come from anyways . I DOUBT that GFS strings are domestic production , for instance .	1
This On Stage ASFSS6 GB Dual Screen Pop Filter performs great and makes me sound professional . I particularly like the flexible gooseneck , which makes adjustments on target.Also , the filter arrived well packaged and in perfect order . A well deserved 5 star rating for this affordable product .	1
I 'm never playing another guitar without these locks ! After my Custom Telecaster fell . The neck went out of wack , I had to readjust the truss rod and spend hours to setup the guitar again ! That 's every musician 's nightmare ! I immediately started doing research for a proper locking mechanism for my straps . Schaller kept coming up . I looked at the design and was confident it was safe to use.One issue you may run into is the nut running loose . That 's not a problem with the scaller locks , it happens to anything that uses these type of nuts ( it has happened on my guitars where the input jack is ) . A drop of glue around the threading can fix that issue easily .	1
Nice cymbal , better price . I 'm no Metallurgist but this cymbal seems to compare with the more expensive ones without the high price tag .	1
Great bag , well padded the shoulder strap is nice ! perfect ! and very good price ! What you would come to expect from lanikai !	1
There 's a reason every mic cabinet has at least one of these ( and if it does n't , it should ) . This is a great all purpose dynamic mic , I use it for instruments , vocals , even field recording sometimes . The SM58 has a frequency response that is supposed to be more tailored towards vocals , but that does n't mean that the 57 ca n't handle a voice . They 're pretty much the same mic as far as I 'm concerned , and for the average amateur recording engineer or home studio practitioner I think you 'll find the same thing . And if you 're operating at a level where you refuse to use them interchangeably , then you probably already know what you 're looking for . I 'll be getting a 58 to add to my personal cabinet soon , but if you 're like me and wanted to spend more on a nice condenser before filling out your dynamic mics , you ca n't go wrong here .	1
I bought this pedal wanting classic distortion and find it more useful as an overdrive pedal . The distortion range does not get as hot as a RAT or MXR classic distortion but it sounds great with a telecaster and tube amp . I use it with a cigar box guitar also for fun and the tone ranges from 60 's and 70 's distortion to 80 's metal . I get a more extreme distortion from my old hissing Boss Mega Distion as an example.I like that the pedal has a wide array of uses . The build quality seems questionable from MXR . As others have posted , the box is very light and the knobs seem thinner than other MXR 's , espeacially the older ones , but this pedal seems solid and makes no noise.The price and demo videos were the primary reason I bought this pedal and I am happy with it . I have many distortion pedals and each one is useful in their own way . I would steer clear of this if you are looking for a pedal for metal and definately buy it if you are into classic rock , twang , and blues .	1
This is one of the best tuner I have had , what a great value for a low cost . Thank to all for selling this Guitar Tuner at Amazon .	1
Sometime round 1994 , my friend Kendal built several of these for our band . They were great and incredibly handy . I havent investigated this , but i wondered later when i started seeing them marketed if he had developed the first one or not . Certainly , if he did , he never patented it or anything.Anyway , flash forward 18 years and here i was sitting with my row of stompboxes , resenting batteries and individual power supplies . I thought back fondly to my first sound combo power supply and realized i needed to invest in one again ... .and so i did . This one comes with some slip covers for any unused adapters . So far , it has lived up to my expectations . I cat speak to playing out with this yet , as i am mostly messing around in my little home studio , but i definitely havent heard any crackle on my recordings or when just amping up and letting loose . So , for such a simple device , you really cant beat it ... unless you dont really use boxes . Personally , i presently have my wah , distortion , chorus , overdrive , delay , slap echo , and flanger running through it . Everything works great.Enjoy !	1
I have two of these for my acoustics , and when I get another acoustic ... I 'll be buying another one of these . Nice quick release without having to tie anything . I have one that is over 5 years old and still works like a charm .	1
These end pins are so simple and logical that I 'm surprised it 's taken the design process this long to get to this point . I used to use Schaller straplocks but they 're not compatible with all straps . If the end leather/material is too thick , the lock wo n't fit . I enjoy the elliptical endpin design , as it helps me feel confident the strap will stay on , but I can easily remove the strap or use another on the guitar . I highly recommend you try this out if you 're looking for a great way to keep your strap secured .	1
I use this adapter to connect my electric guitar and my acoustic guitar to my computer and IT WORKS PERFECTLY ! ! ! Very minimal buzz ... LLLOVE IT ! ! !	1
this is a great item.and works as reported.It seemed to be in my fretting hands way a little , but its ok	1
I have one of these in every one of my guitar cases . You never know when you have to replace a string and this is a convenient helper . Cutter , winder and pin puller . Gets the job done and it is inexpensive .	1
This is my second Ernie Ball strap i have gotten , and sure there are cheaper straps out there its a crapshoot what your going to get from them . These straps have leather ends that hold the guitar securely , the strap itself is a step down from a seatbelt ( If a seatbelt will keep me in place at high speeds this strap will keep your guitar in place at low speeds ) , and the length would be sufficient even if you are 7 ft. tall . Coming in several different colors to match any color guitar this is the only strap i will buy in the future .	1
Sounds like a great concept and they seem well made . I just do n't care for them . I know others love them so I guess it 's just a personal thing.It took weeks to receive them in the US . Do n't be in a rush .	1
For $ 13 , its hard to say anything bad about this gadget . It 's accurate in any sound environment , easy to read in any light , very portable , and will tune any stringed instrument . The visual metronome with no click or beep is pretty useless but that 's a silly extra that does n't interfere with anything so no problem .	1
Behringer has done it again . The PP400 Ultra-Compact Phono Preamp is exactly what it looks like : It 's ultra-compact . It takes up a very negligible amount of space . It will sit comfortably between a turntable and another component.In its compactness , though , it does NOT sacrifice usability . It has no trouble amplifying a turntable 's signal to line level . Before buying a preamp , amp could only boost my turntable to a 'easy listening ' level . The noise was evident in the signal due to far too much amplification being necessary . With the help of this preamp , my amp no longer acts as a crutch and I can comfortably listen to music without my amp 's 'I 'm turned up to 11 and struggling ' noise.The build quality is far superior than anything else at this price point . It 's not cheap plastic like many companies would try to sell , the entire enclosure is fairly thick metal . This makes for a nice interference shield and overall pleasing look . It also features a ground terminal which will hook up to many turntables and amps to further reduce interference.Unfortunately , there is no option to buy it in black . Judging from the accessible screws on the side , though , it would be a small task to take apart the enclosure and paint it myself if I wanted.This preamp also does not have a power switch , but this is not much of an issue . It 's one small complaint on an otherwise amazing product.Summary : If you need a preamp , buy this one . It has the same build quality and performance as much more expensive preamps .	1
I 've owned just about every muff . No Triangle or Civil War . But this is my favorite muff thus far . Way more versatile than any other muff . The switches involment in the the circuit really is n't too elaborate , but then again all bypasses are n't . I love wicker on and tone off . Cuts like a buffalo . I hate to have a bunch of fuzz 's and distortions in my chain , but its there right next to a Keeley Fuzz Head , a Analogman Peppermint Fuzz , and a TS-9 modded to an 808 w/ Brown that I modded myself . I love this Muff ! I ca n't wait to see what they do next . Plus ... These new EHX pedals are build tough as nails and full true bypass . If you like muffs , you 'll really like this one . If you did n't like muffs before , you 'll probably like the wicker feature , it makes it far more clear and pronounced and less of a glob a goo and more distortion/ fuzz friendly . I give it four stars , because the five is only meant meant for devices that you just freak out and half to have , for me the Keeley Fuzz Head is a five , I love that thing .	1
These strings are good . Nice tone , last a decent amount of time , and they 're cheap . Color coded ball-ends make it easy to string without having to pay much attention . I use these on all my electric guitars now , where before I used Dean Markley 11-52 ( mostly Les Paul scale ) - I moved to these when I got a strat-scale guitar . I do n't remember why I picked these , other than they are cheap and readily available everywhere , where Dean Markley can be hit or miss .	1
Love the quick release system , I just hook on one end to the guitar and the other to a strap , perfect for use when you are standing and playing . I can just quick release it when I 'm done.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you , it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews , and leave a comment if you have any questions , I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help .	1
I put these strings on every acoustic I own . They sound great and are priced right ! You ca n't go wrong with D'Addario strings !	1
It 's worth a few extra dollars and a little extra time to install these . It sure beats fixing a cracked neck , headstock , or guitar body after a guitar slips off the strap pins and falls for a great height !	1
I received a MIM Stratocaster as a gift a year ago . Recently , I noticed the occasional moment where no signal would make it to the amp . After tracing the issue , I discovered there was some play in the Strat 's jack and the right angle of pull on the cable would keep it from making a positive connection with the tip . A quick fix was to bend the jack 's connector end , but the root of the problem was substandard metal that had too much flex and would permanently open , making a minor gap where there was n't that positive connection.I 've purchased several Switchcraft jacks and they just work . Stronger , more flexible metal , easy soldering , good materials . It 's a very wise investment and makes a trustworthy connection . Obviously , because the finish is chromed , oxidation can get in the way of the connection , but that only happens after a few years of use and can easily be remedied . If oxidation/wear is an issue , Switchcraft makes gold-plated jacks . However , I just love these jacks , and for the price , they really ca n't be beat .	1
For 10 bucks this is great , very sturdy and reliable . Works wit all my guitars , and for the price it is a steal .	1
I do n't really care for the FX loop on my Fender Supersonic Head , as I started to get more pedals in my system and really digging all the MXR pedals . so when this came out last year I snatched one up and started experimenting with it . I LOVE it , bypassed I still get that in your face strait into an amp sound , but ingage it with my delays and phase 90 's and set the gate to about two o clock and it does a great job of clamping down on the tail end hiss . very cool , and of course it is an MXR so it is built like a tank	1
I have used the EXL115W set for years . Nice to have the whole set again . Sometimes have to buy the EXL115 without the wound third , and then have to find the wound third in a single string . Not fun . I like the sound of the wound third . I play a thin hollow-body electric and love how the strings sound and are easy on the fingers . No more thick calouses on the fingers . Playing weekinds and practicing , they last a long time with the same sound quality .	1
I have to say I was pretty skeptical about how this would sound but I was shocked at the sounds I could get.It took just too a few seconds to dial in the tone I wanted and off we went.For the money and ease of practicing at anytime with a great tone is worth twice as much.As far as durability I have had in a month used it 10 times , so far so good.I did purchase the protection plan for $ 10 so I 'm covered for 2 years .	1
Solidly built , small tester that can easily be carried around in a gig bag . There is n't really much in the way of instructions , but the LEDs are fairly well labeled and straight forward enough to figure it out .	1
I 've used all sorts of strings over the years , and generally aim for GHS strings . However , these Power Slinky strings are great . I 've not broken one yet , and the 11-48 is a good gauge . Heavy , powerful , and they sound nice and soulful when played . I may become a lifelong Ernie Ball user after using these strings .	1
We live in an age of endless boutique guitar effect pedals . One could make a very expensive hobby of collecting only high dollar dirt pedals . It 's not unusual to see an online review and think a pedal sounds good then find out that it costs $ 150 , $ 200 , $ 250 , $ 350 ... whatever . There are a LOT of really expensive distortion/OD pedals out there.I 've had my Bad Monkey for about 7 years , after hearing good things I took a chance and gigged with it for many years . I rarely use a lot of gain on most pedals , just because those fuzzier tones can easily get lost in the mix . I generally use the Bad Monkey for mid-gain crunch tones , and for that it 's just fantastic.Having two tone controls makes all the difference . This pedal is Tubescreamer-esque , but not as midrange-heavy as a TS . Anyway , this thing sounds great . Excellent classic rock and lead tones.The things it WO N'T do : 1 ) a clean boost . It has plenty of output , but there 's always a little bit of dirt in the signal , so it ca n't be used as a pure clean boost . 2 ) it wo n't clean up when you turn your guitar down ... or at least not much . No dialing in a crunch tone then turning down your guitar volume for a clean rhythm tone . I have a Barber LTD which does that beautifully.But , despite those limitations , the Bad Monkey is awesome . At the very least it can be a great `` throw in your case to take to a jam '' pedal , but it 's worth having on your pedalboard , as well .	1
I have one gig bag already ( not like this Fender ) , and wanted another gig bag for a third guitar I bought . This Fender is lots better then my other bag . My other bag has the storage pockets on the broad bottom part but not the nice storage pockets up on the neck like this Fender bag . The Finder 's padding is a bit better than my other bag also , but , of course , neither is as good as hard case.I am handicapped with a prosthesis on my right leg . I need the back pack straps on back of a gig back to help me transport my guitar , because I use crutches and they require my hands . The Fender 's straps are great . The left strap on my other gig bag would often work its over and off my shoulder and then the guitar would hang all catty-wompass and it became difficult for me to carry . The straps on this Fender stay put - love it.The guitar I tote in this bag is a Martin HD-28 . But , it can also my Blueridge BR-180 or my Seagull S6 Coastal Spruce . Either of my three acoustic guitars fit the Fender gig bag perfectly.Like I said , its a great gig bag . If I ever need another , I 'll be getting another Fender gig bag .	1
This is my first attempt at buying a polishing cloth for my guitars . I tried this untreated 'MicrofiberPolish Cloth ' on my Gibson ES-339 because I had heard good things about it.We 'll begin with some stats : the cloth is 11-3/4 '' by 11-3/4 '' and has an 1/8 '' border stitched aroundthe edge . It feels very soft to the touch and it is made in Korea . There is a small warning on theback of the package that states : `` Not designed for cleaning electrical devices . '' You can also washthis untreated polish cloth in mild soap and water , rinse it out and hang it up to dry . Now to thereview.My guitar has an Ebony hard lacquer finish , meaning very glossy and shiny . I have been playing thisguitar for about a year now and it had a lot finger smudges on the body 's front and back and BACKof the neck . I was able to get most of the minor finger smudges off . When going after the moreresistant multiple smudges the polish cloth would spread it around and left most of the problem onthe finish.What I discovered about this cloth , even with increased elbow grease , is that it has it 's limitations.So , if your guitar is reasonably clean and the smudges are fairly new this cloth is dynamite and takesthem right out . If the body oils have been there for awhile , probably collecting dust , then you willneed some type of cleaning liquid to help you break up the old fuzzy oils on your instrument . Pleaseuse any liquid sparingly when applying it to the surface of your instrument . Do not put a liquid directlyonto the surface of your instrument . You should put the cleaning liquid onto the cleaning cloth firstthen apply it.I decided to use Dunlop 's 'Dunlop Formula 65 Guitar Polish & Cleaner ' to cut and clean up the tougheroily smudges . I used another soft cotton cloth and it cleaned up very nicely . Since then I have beenable to keep the guitar polished and clean using only the 'Planet Waves Microfiber Polish Cloth ' . It doesnot leave scratches or any marks when used without a liquid . I also did not have a problems with thecloth breaking down and leaving lint or pieces of cloth behind.You want to use a another cloth to clean your fretboard and not the same one you use for the finish.The fretboard gets a lot of oily dirt assigned to it through repeated play . I would be fearful that theadditional oils accumulated on the fret board will get into the Microfiber cloth and transfer to the finishof the guitar.So like a lot of things in life there are limitations to everything . I gave this untreated microfiber cloth4 stars because it does a fine job keeping my guitar clean and polished with minimal effort . My highexpectations , based upon the blurb , were that this cloth would clean up more ensconced oils and dirtbut it only smeared them around . It was more trouble than it was worth to use the microfiber cloth toclean up the smeared mess.Nonetheless , I like this cloth and recommend it for upkeep purposes and minor dirt or grime . I will bekeeping it in my guitar case just for this particular guitar finish and use each time I am done playing .	1
I use these on my basses and they do the job quite well.. They are easy to install on the bass and the strap .	1
We ordered one , it worked so nicely , we ordered 2 more . You can adjust the tension precisely to fit your guitar , and minimize string stress and de-tuning each time you move your capo . Very nice product .	1
It 's survived my clumsiness and I can load it with 4 pounds of guitar books without it breaking a sweat .	1
All guitarists know that there are 1 billion strat copies out there . They vary a bit , but basically you have a light , 3 pickup , versitale guitar that does that job - that is about it . But this Legacy , which I can see as I am typing , is much more.First , the natural finish is what got me started . It seems that a natural finish is about as rare as a news web site without video ads . I looked at $ 700+ Fenders , but except for the natural finish - what was I getting for $ 700 ? I wanted a strat copy that I could customize - this is IT ! . I am putting split hot rail-type pickups in this , and WOW I have a strat , 3-pickup LP , and anything in between.Get one !	1
This is an essential accessory for the excellent Line 6 Spider IV combo amps , For more details , see my review of the Line 6 Spider IV 75 watt combo . The FBV Express Mk II is the least expensive pedal to give one full control over all basic and essential amp features . This pedal should have been ( or be ) included with the amp but it was n't . Anyway , if you are considering buying the amp ( which is great ) , you really will want to have this pedal , even though it costs 33 % of the price of the amp itself.With the FBV Express Mk II you can store the 4 amp channels , each of which has its own settings for model and all effects , as well as control the 14 second looping ability of the Spider IV . The pedal also adds a volume/way pedal ( the wah pedal is OK but not as full-throated as a Cry Baby or other stand-alone wah wahs ) . Without the pedal , you will not be able to access looping and channel switching in real time while playing ( which is the whole point of this thing ) unless you have more than the standard compliment of 2 arms , equipped with one hand each.The pedal also interfaces with a computer to allow deep editing and storing of all of the effects of the Line 6 Spider IV combos through a USB port . This feature alone makes it a must-have for taking full advantage of the amp.J.M . Tepper	1
I have an Alvarez Yari acoustic guitar that I absolutely love . but I have wanted , missed a warmer tone ( the body of this guitar is slightly smaller than many and I had always assumed that I would never be able to get the tone I wanted in the low end ... as compared to the bass enhancing body of a typical dreadknot style of guitar , for example ... ) .Then a friend recommended I try these strings , and , to my mind , my guitar has seen nothing short of a transformation ! Here is the gorgeous tone I had missed ! I am now on my second set of strings , and I am hooked.One thing : I have heard that these strings are n't as durable as other strings.However , this has n't bothered me , as tend to finger-pick and soft strum , and so , this possibility has n't become an issue for me.And while I would make no claim that everyone would have the great experience I did , I would wholeheartedly recommend trying these strings to anyone looking for a variation in tone.The fact that it is easier on the fingers is another reason to give these a try ! Thumbs up !	1
Works like a charm . Powers up to five 9V effects , using one power supply . I am using four plugs and it has worked flawlessly . No more dead 9V batteries . Some effects eat 9V batteries like a 6 year old with a cone of cotton candy .	1
This works fine , although the mount is a bit weird to me ... but I see that most are the same . As a pop filter it works perfectly and I was not able to hear any clarity loss or sound coloring . Just pop filtering through black pantyhose ! ! lol	1
The Evans Pedal Patch will work for you great.. It will keep your mass drum head from gettingworn and nasty.. I cheap buy and it works excellent..	1
This nylon pick has great play feel . It is stiff enough to pick individual strings and still feels comfortable stumming chords .	1
Normally I prefer a harder pick but I switch to these after 9pm when playing my acoustic guitar to keep the peace with the neighbors . These super light flexible nylon picks are great if you 're trying to play quietly . If you prefer a flexible , softer pick as many people do these are also excellent for your regular go to pick .	1
We use these on our wireless microphones and they have very vibrant color and easy for us to determine which microphone is associated with which volume dial on the amplifier .	1
It 's not going to win any awards for sound quality , but it sure is cute . As you might expect , it 's a pretty boxy sounding little amp , more reminiscent of 60 's portable transistor radios than a double stack Marshall . But it did the two things I wanted it for . First , it has a belt clip , which I can attach to my belt or a guitar strap . Second , it has a headphone out , so I can plug in a set of ear buds ( 1/8 & # 34 ; stereo jack ) . You can get it to a clean decent practice room level if you keep the drive control set at minimum . Surprisingly , the Drive control works it 's way in gradually , letting you control the distortion a bit with the guitar volume control . With the drive control cranked up , you can get the amp unexpectedly loud , but terribly distorted . For something you can throw in your guitar gig bag and take with you wherever you go , it 's not too bad . With a set of earphones , I would put it on par with some of the more expensive amp-jacks that are available . If you plan to use it as a practice amp and you 're not moving about , I would recommend getting a power supply ( will use the same ones as most effects pedals ) . Battery life appears to be around 3~5 hours , but the performance starts degrading at about an hour 's use .	1
This guitar is probably one of the best I have ever owned . The tone is near perfection and it has pretty decent stock action and strings . You might need to adjust the neck a bit and some new strings probably would n't hurt but my god ! What an amazing guitar !	1
This is the best invention since the wheel , as far as I 'm concerned . It 's easy to clamp onto my guitar head , and the frequency/not readings are quite accurate . It 's incredibly easy to use and very handy when re-stringing a guitar .	1
took longer than I wanted but im in cali and they are in jersey so ... when I got the patches they were better quality than I expected . So It was cool .	1
I did get 5 thumb picks in my order ( a previous reviewer mentioned only getting 4 ) , and I always really liked the classic turtle-shell look ( far more purty-like than the plain , thick white of Nationals and others ) . But these are large ? And , yes , I double checked the packaging to ensure I was shipped large . The National mediums I was using before had a looser fit -boggle- . But nevertheless , the Planet Waves ' far tighter fit actually feel better than the National mediums , which certainly had a clunky sensation ; there is probably a small weight difference between the two that would explain the overall feeling of quicker movement while having good solid interactions on the strings . All in all , 4 stars . Still ... these were a large ? Hate to see how the mediums fit .	1
I 'm used to the mic extension that uses a short gooseneck . Occassionally there are problems with this set up . Then I saw these . No more bendable problems , I really love these extensions .	1
Nice solid no frills guitar strap . I used this on my stupid heavy Agile guitar and it helped a lot .	1
I already had two Behringer stompboxes , and am thinking of adding a few more , so I thought rather than having a mess on the stage , I 'd get a pedalboard . I had n't really studied them too much , except to note that they all seemed to be way more money than they were worth . Then , recently I found this one for less than a hundred bucks , so I really could n't pass it up . I am very impressed with this unit . It is well made , well designed , and comes with all sorts of cords and accessories . Nothing is lacking to start playing right away . I 'm not sure how easy other brands stompboxes will fit into this board ( you may need to trim the foam that holds them in a little bit ) , but I think the board should be pretty universal for whatever you have . I am not disappointed in the least . I think you will like this board .	1
I really like the one-handed operation , and I really do prefer that the access to it is behind the fret board instead of out front . That makes it easier to reach for a quick change , and for easy on/off . I 've been a Jim Dunlop fan for more than 40 years , and this product just reinforces that !	1
Excellent Quality and Craftsmanship.I was expecting less of this product for its price and the job it will do , I figured it would be made out of a `` cheap '' feeling metal . I was wrong . It is very stable and steady and feels like good steel or aluminum maybe . It is strong to . It feels like I could really bang it ( I wo n't ) and it would not break.I use this with an Audio Technica AT2020 which screws in perfectly snug but is still rotatable on the base . The mount holds it firm and keeps the mic still . It does eliminate a little vibration but if you pound on your desk ( or whatever ) that will still come through . It looks cool too ( and everybody knows that matters ) . I am very pleased with this purchase .	1
Sturdy cord and plugs , inexpensive , good value . I do n't require professional-level equipment , so this cord serves my purposes well . Satisfied with purchase .	1
For the money , this karaoke mic does a decent job for any vocal use . Good to keep as a spare in the gig box .	1
Super easy to install on guitar , they look great and they make changing strings a breeze . In just a few minutes I had restrung and tuned my guitar with no problems at all . The best replacement for Fender tuners , by far .	1
If was looking to get my 3 amps off the flood . I have 2 70w 12 & # 34 ; amps and a big Fender DSP 212 . I am using this for my 1-12 amps . It works very well . I recommend them to do the job for the $ $ . I am not sure I would use them for a $ 1,200 Sunn V4 4x12 cabinet	1
Works well even with a room full of noise ... ... ... ... ... ... ..plus it 's easy to see . These are the best buy for my money when it comes to tuning a Guitar or Uke .	1
This strap is cool , it is black , made of nice material with gel padding , and it Velcros open and closed so that you can just take it on and off a guitar strap without undoing the strap from the person or the guitar . Like a clasp it just wraps around the strap and Velcros . Where I once noticed pressure and chaffing from my nylon strap , now I feel nothing but a heavy pad which puts no pressure on me whatsoever . Adds about 2 lbs to the weight of your guitar . Get it if your strap is n't feeling good , other brands work too but you have to thread it through the strap which suckssss . This one is legit .	1
The Danelectro mini amp was an impulse buy for me , but this thing is fantastic ! clean tones to woodstock fuzz , this thing belts 'em out . only complaint- battery does n't last too long . get a power adapter . otherwise- GREAT PRACTICE AMP !	1
These Fender Q/R knobs came in and looked Good on my Schecter.. I have n't had any Problems with them , They installed just Fine . I did have to put a Tooth pick in one of the Screw holes to tighten it up .	1
Quality strap that fits tight & secure on my signature Dime and matches the Dean From Hell lightening graphics perfectly .	1
Nice mic - good quality , no problems and have used this heavy over the past year . Sounds identical to my Shure SM58 , but MUCH less .	1
Dunlop 5005 Pick Holder , this is very handled , always forget were my pick got off too , now I know my Picks is in the holder .	1
great little cable . now i power all my pedals with one power supply . makes setting up for gigs much easier	1
Very sturdy stand made to last a lifetime . Easy enough to adjust and can hold a lot of weight . Can not go wrong with this one .	1
Great price and quality . It is nice to not have to connect two pedals 6 inches away with a 10 ' cable .	1
Great bang for the buck clone of a Tech 21 GT-2 . This pedal does not have the build quality of the GT-2 but the controls are identical and it sounds darn good ( especially for the pocket change they charge ) . I have not done a gut-shot comparison of the two pedals so I can not comment on how close the actual circuits and components are . The TM300 is more than just a distortion box . It 's more like a preamp . I find that it does a very convincing mid scooped Twin type of clean as well as a decent Marshall type growl . I find the Mesa to be the least authentic though it is not an unpleasant distortion by any means- it just does n't sound like a Mesa imho . If you are looking for triple rec distortion there are probably better dirt boxes for that . I actually have the same criticism of my Tech 21 Tri-AC ( really excellent pedal ! ) The TM300 works well running into an amp and because it can simulate a mic 'd cab it can also be run directly into a PA or mixer and bypass the amp completely . This thing actually takes other pedals reasonably well . It can really breath new life into a mediocre practice amp ( or any solid state ) . It can also be stowed in a bag easily enough so that you do n't have to lug a backup amp to gigs . I find it much more realistic sounding than digital modelers but it does n't quite 100 % replicate the sound and touch sensativity of a tube amp being pushed ( they have n't invented that yet in my opinion ) . It does n't replace a tube amp for me personally but if you are contemplating running straight into the PA because lugging your amp is impractical this is a no-brainer . Five stars for what it does at this price . If you are a hobbyist or weekend warrior this pedal will cover the bases . If you make your living doing live performances ( or if price is not factored into your decision making ) I would advise you to pony up the extra money for the Tech 21 product because their overall build quality is much higher ( with regards to the enclosure , switch , knobs , jacks ) , their customer service is top-shelf and they are engineered/manufactured right in NYC . I own three Tech 21 pedals and previously owned their Trademark 60 amp and I can attest to the difference in overall build quality between their products and Behringer 's . Sound-wise they are very very similar though and I DO have much love for these inexpensive Behringer pedals . I own close to a dozen of them and I have not encountered a single malfunction in more than 2 years .	1
They look nice and do the job perfectly well . The price is not too bad . The colours help with organization .	1
Beatiful , amazing strap . Very soft , very confortable , sits perfetcly on fender strap lock , and looks like my G & L Custom Fender Select Case . What else , so ?	1
Plugged it in and it powered my Rode NT2 condenser mic . I was delighted .	1
i originally wanted the Boss DD , but after doing a side by side demo , i decided that i 'm not Buckethead and do n't need a 150 dollar pedal just to do some intro stuff now and then . I have the Berhinger Reverb Machine and HellBabe and they do equal if not ... ..no they do equal to my Boss counterparts . Especially if you are looking for a unique sound that is n't stock Boss . i would n't take these on the road or anything without 3 or 4 backups , but for recording and doing demos Behinger is the way to go , timed effects wise anyway . they are made of plastic after all .	1
I have many so-called travel size acoustic guitars and have changed out all of the over sized strings that were installed on them ( typically 12-54 's ) with these 10-47 's ( or 11-52 's for beefy 7/8 and 3/4 scale guitars ) in all cases , has brought the smaller guitars from duds to nice playing instruments.Three radical samples come to mind : On an old 1931 Gibson L1 , the 12-54 's pulled the bridge out.On an SX Traveler , you could not hear the Low E until I got rid of the 12-54's.On my Lil Martin , the lower bout started to delam under the pressure of the bridge pull.Short scale acoustic guitars are someplace between a full size acoustic and a Ukulele and in most cases are not set up for heavier gauge strings ( even though the manufacturers insist on delivering them this way ) due to their short scales , small frets , and light construction.If you ca n't hear the low E , or you are having problems fretting your strings , try these , what can it hurt ?	1
I purchased this for my pedalboard a few years ago , and have always loved it . I only use 3-4 pedals , and this is always one of them . It sounds great , is indestructable , and takes up almost no space . The controls are great , and you can get a large variety of sounds . I have played `` boutique '' chorus pedals , and the Boss is loads better in every way . You will not regret this purchase.Pros : -easy to use-no hum-small-sonds awesome-indestructabecons : -NONEIf you want an awesome chorus that has been around forever , will last forever , and sounds incredible , get this .	1
I usually stickup to the OverDrive pedals , asking tons of sound from tubes and extra overdrives . Still , I needed a Distortion that could cover of the Marshall sound-like roar JCM-800 ... and this guy did the job ! It 's not a Riot , but ... pretty much defends its self from the old 70-80s songs . Love it !	1
It winds well and can cut off excess string thereafter . The design also includes a bridge pin puller that comes in handy . With some acquired technique this tool does a job .	1
I am completely blown away with these headphones . The second I got them in the mail I plugged it up to my mac pro , opened up itunes and played a song . Simply put it was amazing , I was able to hear EVERY single track individually ! I later plugged the ATH-M50 's into a Korg triton studio , recorded a session with some great microphones and edited a project in final cut all with the same results . The sound is so clear with these headphones you will notice every flaw no matter how small in whatever you are working on ( which is a great thing ) . I have worked with a lot of headphones including some that cost many times what these do and I keep coming back . I have seen a few people comment that the bass is not `` punchy enough '' this is simply not true , the bass is amazing , any stronger and these headphones would not be true to the source . Make no mistake the ATH-M50 's are extremely accurate and sound fantastic .	1
these are well made ... good enough to give to buddies and have a few in every guitar case i own..will purchase again..enjoy	1
Does the job nicely , I use these for me guitar thats set for slide playing and I 've not had any problems with them . Good solid strings	1
I used to be that guy that lost about 30 guitar picks a month . I bought three of these Dunlop Pick Holders , one for each of the three gauges I find myself constantly using , and they 've more than paid for themselves in the short time I 've had them .	1
This clip on tuner by Snark is fantastic , works great ! It alows you to fine tune each string . Buy it !	1
It works well , I use it for my Oscar Schmidt . I do n't use it for feedback , I use it to protect it from the dust . It fits tight but it 's fine !	1
I bought this tuner primarily for my wife who plays harp ( I play guitar ) . She has been using my guitar tuner which works okay but cumbersome . I was hoping this tuner would clip on the top of the harp to make it easier for her.Unfortunately , it does n't fit on top of our harp . The tuner is rather small which is nice for transporting but the clip will not open wide enough for the top of the harp . It does , however , clip into the sound hole okay.It tunes the harp fairly well . I only had problems with the top 3-4 strings which I had to pluck a bit harder for the tuner to pick up.I also tried it on my acoustic guitar and it did the job perfectly . ( Clipped it to the top of the headstock ) Tracking is very , very good for a tuner at this price . I was able to play the strings , tune them , and watch the meter follow the note . Display is very easy to read and lights up nicely . I was tuning in a dim-lit room and was able to read it perfectly . I 'm sure it would be great on a dark stage.The only other drawback is that the display needs to be positioned within a certain range . Otherwise it gets a big hard to read . But positioning it is very simple since it swivels easily.4 out 5 only because of size ( not fitting on harp as I hoped ) and display legibility depending on angle ( I had to reposition it maybe 2 times in order to tune the whole harp ) .	1
I 'm a raw and green beginner who is about the slowest learner ever.am 43 almost 44 and have been learning since 42 almost 43 . That being said using the looper was an eye opener . I bought it as a learning aide , to loop a progression and then try and run some pentatonics over the progression . The thing that opened my eyes is listening to the looped progression I played . There 's no denying your mistakes when you hear them while not playing . Let 's just say I 'm not as close to being a player as I thought and I would & # 34 ; not & # 34 ; figured this out for quite some time if not for the looper . So it is an amazing critic for us beginners . And if your like me ( and you experienced guitarist ) you saw all the demos online and know what you as an experienced player can use it for . It 's an incredibly easy to use piece of equipment , after playing around with it for about 5or 10 mins you 'll have the gist of it . From what I understand it 's very basic compared to other loopers , i dont know anything about that but if your looking for just a simple to use looper this will definitely be to your satisfaction .	1
Works like its supposed to . No complaints at all for the price . I will be buying more in the future .	1
It cuts down the buzz left by the other pedals , for that price it 's pretty good , not badly built either .	1
This is a tough deal to beat on a boom stand . It is very well made , and it is very adjustable so no issues sitting or standing , playing with an instument or just singing . Only thing , make sure you read the description well . It is a euro stand so it has 5/8 '' -27 threads . It does not come with a mic clip . When I ordered my mic from Behringer , their clip had 3/8 '' standard threads which obviously would not attach . I ordered a univeral clip so that drove the cost up some . Now if the manufacture would just provide a clip , they would have the best stand deal going . Overall , I would buy again !	1
It works and is very versatile and puts out great sound and power . the portable feature is great also . Just what i wanted	1
I have never owned a Straplock system prior to owning these Dunlops , and boy am I amazed ! Every straplock system I 've used in the past , on friends ' guitars , semi-permanently mounted the strap to the guitar - often with extra ties and all manner of things that made it impractical to detach the strap on a whim . In contrast , these locks have a mechanism that make it trivially easy to pop the strap on and off - it 's great ! Better still , the hardware fit almost perfectly into my existing screw holes , making installation trivial . And the new posts are so close in size and shape to the old ones that I think I could slap any strap onto my guitar in a pinch , using the posts like the OEM ones . This is a great system , and I would highly recommend it for anyone who uses a strap on any electric guitar .	1
I really like this strap , it 's comfortable , adjusts easily , and the pick holder is really convenient . This is my second one for my other guitar .	1
It is my son 's first guitar and he is learning on it well . It is still in great condition . good quality Guitar !	1
Like it better than the other tuner I bought , this one was a dollar more and cant remember what the other one was but would defiantly buy this again .	1
This tuner does a great job tracking notes rather quickly , and I 've enjoyed using it . It does its job , and it 's well worth the money .	1
very quick shipping , it works perfectly , I was able to screw it in without and pre-drilling as well . works with multiple straps as well .	1
I 've been using this stuff for about 8 years or so and I really do n't play without it it makes chord changes faster and easier and your fingers slide real easy .	1
Granted , I 'm no expert on what 's out there in the world for guitar cleaning materials . This is my first foray into that world.But , I 've used it , and it 's easy . The polish is great , the cloths are soft and just what they should be ; the wax is wonderfully shiny and easy to put on and buff . Everything here is , as far as I can tell , just as advertised - a way to keep one 's instruments in good shape.I now have a shine on my guitar that is better than when it arrived from the factory , and there does n't seem to be any chemicals in the stuff that corrodes or otherwise destroys the guitar , like perhaps some fly-by-night cheapy cheapy product maker might offer.Maybe there are better polishes and waxes out there - and knowing the way the world works , I 'm sure there are some , probably made out of rare elephant glandular excretions that sell for $ 500 a bottle that the pros use and maybe would be worth 6 or 7 stars on the Amazon review . I do n't know . But come on ; this stuff is just fine .	1
Tascam is an industry leader in pro audio and have been for many years . Their quality is unmatched dollar for dollar and these are no exception . Excellent sound quality , premium fit and comfort for wearing all day as we do at the station . You ca n't go wrong with these , we 're ordering 8 more pairs !	1
I 've been trying out different picks for a few weeks now looking for the perfect one for hybrid picking . So far this is the one and I think my search is actually over . I 've tried theJim Dunlop 427P3 Dun Ultex Jazz Iii Ply Pkand that was close but this is the one . These Davas have a great feel in my bigger fingers , does n't slip around at all and is very sharp and fast on alternate and hybrid picking . Pick noise has also been reduced because there is much less friction than with most others ; the notes ring out very clearly even on fast runs .	1
Great product . D'Addario always makes great products at great prices . I use these on my pedal board and they are always reliable and cost effective .	1
I 've bought these D'Addario strings a few times because they are a great deal . They sound nice and bright , and they last a good while . They are easy on the fingers . The best part is that you save money by buying them in a 3-pack .	1
I give them an excellent rating . They do last a long time , and they do not seem to alter in tone and get that `` muddy '' sound when they 're aging . In fact , I 'd say they actually do manage to approach David Gilmour 's tone at times ! I could barely believe that , of course , but after playing hard for a few hours , I actually said to myself the phrase : `` Wow , that sounded like David Gilmour somewhat . '' So , the fact that that occurred without me actually thinking about Pink Floyd or Gilmour and just being lost in the playing says a lot , because I then realized I had strung up the guitar with the strings that day . Get them if you like Gilmour . I 'm hard on pricing , usually , but I say these are priced decently for their effectiveness .	1
These are solid cables -- tight fit in receptacles , no introduction of noise , and no discernible loss of signal . Especially considering the price , these are brilliant . I was like some of the reviewers wondering if such an economical cable could be any good , but I trusted their judgment and gave these a try and so count me in among those who were n't sure but have become convinced that Hosa knows how to make a great cable , and to do so without the need to charge Monster Prices .	1
Whatever the name , this pedal is from the Ibanez Tube Screamer camp . The packaging description says it uses the JRC4558 chip and MA150 diodes , and yes , Behringer got the sound right . I 'd say this competes well against any of the modded TS pedals . What I love about this pedal is the TONE knob . For the TS pedals in this price range , it 's the most useful . You can set it high , and it is n't too icepicky , yet the entire range is useful . This is great if you use the thing as your main overdrive sound.I prefer this pedal for boosting my gain in a hot amp or pedal , or another overdrive . It works well as a lead boost for rock or blues tones . It could also be used to add a touch of breakup for jazz tones.I bought this pedal to `` semi-retire '' an older Ibanez TS5 soundtank . The switch on that one is n't as good as the Behringer 's . The Behringer has a much smoother action to it when turning the pedal on or off . I use mainly solid state Fender amps , and several distortion pedals ( including a BOSS Metal Zone ) . I 'd bet this would sound great through any tube amp worth its salt . The only downside is the slight lack of bass . If you routinely run your guitar sound through 12 inch speaker setups ( esp . 2x12 and 4x12 ) , or a distorted tone with plenty of bass , this should n't be a problem .	1
This is the best USB microphone out for under $ 100 bucks.It 's a shame that its been out for a few years now , and there has been no one else to try and make a microphone that has the sound quality of this one . I love its sensitivity and it adds very little color to the recording . The sound rejection from the cardioid pattern is very good as I have this fairly close to my computer in my office and I ca n't hear the computer in my recordings.I have n't used this microphone with instruments , as I am using it primarily for recording voice overs for video , and it sounds great.The only thing you have to do it plug it in , and go . You need no additional drivers to run this microphone in Windows 7 . I did have to restart my machine for my video editing software to see the microphone , but it worked perfectly after that.I just wish that there was an option to skip the stand and just get a shock-mount - YETI combo pack , as I have mounted it on a shock mounted stand attached to my desk and have n't used the base that much since arriving at that setup.If you are in the market for an excellent USB microphone , look no further , you ca n't get anything better than this for under $ 100 bucks . Just make sure you get a pop filter for it , and Yes the BLUE Pop Filter will work with this microphone despite all of the negative reviews that it does n't . Just check out my review video for the Blue Pop.Blue Microphones The Pop Universal Pop Filter	1
I have been using an old elastic-bar capo for years because the last spring capo I used did not have nearly enough tension . When I first applied the Planet Waves Tri-Action Capo I thought `` here we go again . '' There was ample tension E-G but B and E were buzzy as all get out . Not expecting much , I adjusted the tension . It took a couple of tries to get it just right , but now the capo works as if it was made specifically for my guitar ... zero buzz across the board . That in and of itself , makes this capo a five in my book . Add in the facts that the release mechanism is a breeze ( on and off ) , it looks nice ( I have the black version ) , as well as its comparative ease on the wallet , and this capo is a rock solid five star product.This capo also has a pick holder . The feature can actually be a little awkward because of its placement in the context of the capo 's overall size and shape , but it is there if you need it and it does not detract from the functionality of the capo itself.Get this capo !	1
It was time for a change after many years of using the same strings and I am really glad I tried Elixir . They feel really nice and sound awesome , I will be sticking with these now , thanks for the good and prompt service as well Cheers ! ! !	1
I first used this pedal when my green screemer died . A friend had and os-2 on hand and let me use it . I had used Boss 's metal zone before and it produced too nasal of a tone for my liking . So I plug into the OS-2 and I was pleasently impressed with the range of distortion and overdrive the OS-2 pedal produced . I play through a '59 fender bassman and the mix of those tubes with this pedal produce some very sweet tones . I have also played this pedal through a solid state amp and I am still impressed . I have spent years searching for a pedal that could produce a nice tight churnch with a warm and low bottom end , my search ended with this pedal . I highly recomend this pedal to any rock , blues , metal , country , or punk guitar player .	1
Since I paid about $ 13 for this , I was not expecting a great deal . What I received was a decent enough floor switch for a Fender Mustang I or II . It works well as a way to switch between two user-determined presets on my Mustang II . Construction is about as good as I would normally get on a $ 13 item . It would be nice if the switch design allowed greater flexibility , but that 's a function of the Mustsng II design overall . I 'm not grading the switch on that.If you have a compatible Fender amp and can get this for less than $ 15 , then it 's a good deal . If prices go above that , best to wait it out or check the pricing of used units on the Amazon Marketplace .	1
I have always been a thin or medium 351 style pick person , but when a fellow musician had one of these on stage I was quite surprised at how well it worked . I have used it on guitar and also on bass and it really works well with a good solid grip to it .	1
I do some guitar repair work and one of my customers needed a LP case . I have bought a lot of stuff here on AZ so looked at this one and had it shipped to him . He says its great so that is my review.Prices are always great on AZ and Prime saves me money in shipping.4 stars is my tops , anywhere .	1
Quite a few people are complaining about the buzz caused/induced by this . I 'm not getting any . I use an old Arion Stage Tuner , a Digitech Bad Monkey and CM-2 Tube Overdrive , a Dunlap Wah from the 90s , and a Boss NS-2 Noise Suppressor . I run it all into a Fender Deville 410 , which additionally runs into an Acoustic B115 Neo bass cab for extra mmmph.At first I thought it was the noise suppressor . But even when it 's off , I 'm getting absolutely no buzz from my effects.For the price this is AMAZING . To be able to have all of my effects powered with one plug is a godsend . The cables are VERY long , maybe too long , if that 's possible . If you 're even thinking about buying this , JUST BUY IT ALREADY ! ! ! !	1
This clamp on pair of miniature lamps does an excellent job of illuminating music , set lists and notes . The manufacturer claims 12 lumens of light , which is roughly equivalent to a 1 Watt bulb , but the lens and the way the light is diffused make them seem much brighter . Since the design keeps the light somewhat directional they are relatively discreet and will not interfere with others on the stage , in the studio or in the audience.The three batteries will last 28 hours of continuous use according to the spec sheet , and that is in the ballpark of the use time I am getting between battery changes.What I love is the dual heads , each on a gooseneck that is over a foot long . The length gives you a lot of flexibility [ no pun intended ] for placing the lights exactly where you want them . The goosenecks easily bend and stay in whatever position you bend them to . The clamp is perfect for most stands and has a layer of padding to prevent marring surfaces . The manufacturer claims that this light can be used free standing . Frankly that is a stretch and I would recommend a light designed with a larger base if that is what you are really looking for . This one does work beautifully clamped to music stands , and the illumination will cover both pages of a chart .	1
What can you say about a Foam Ball type mic windscreen ? Well it fits the RODE M1 Mic I was using nice and tight . Quality is good , did n't tear apart when you put it on the mic and the recorded sound is just fine .	1
Many reviews cover the pro 's of this item , so I 'll be short only to add that they are very sturdy ( when install properly ... suggestion : find a wall stud and use 3 '' screws for heavier instruments ) .Used in our house to hang 2 acoustic guitars and 2 Strat 's . Have n't had an issue with any in the 4-5 months we 've had them up . On the electrics , we use the section of the bracket between the wall and the hook to hang the coiled guitar cable.The hooks are bendable and can adjust or adapt to virtually any style head and are grippy enough to keep slick finishes from slipping.Wonderful simple product that makes displaying or storing your instruments stress free .	1
I 've use these strings for years . I play often and like to change strings often . I can do it without breaking the bank and they hold up well for many practices and gigs . They hold tune very we ( at least on my guitar ) indoors and out . I 'd highly recommend them .	1
Used one of these when I forgot mine and loved it so much , I had to get my own. -- Small , takes up only one spot on a power strip or outlet -- Long cord is great ! -- Enough juice to power all of my pedals simultaneouslyTotally worth the buy . Do it !	1
These picks have served me very well . I am happy with the quality of all of them . I would purchase additional Planet Waves Assorted Pearl Celluloid Guitar Picks	1
I really love the fact that they are color coded so you do n't mix your strings up and easy on my fingers . I love the price , they are a very good brand and easy to install . Highly recommend	1
I had never owned an electronic tuner before , but have used the large models and the iPhone apps . This is a great product . It is easy to use . Adjustable to virtually any stringed instrument . I have n't banged it around , but have had no problems with durability . Bright , easy to read display . I would highly recommend this for beginners to pros alike .	1
Not much to it , does what it should , holds a standard mic . Pivots in 1 direction only . Not the best build quality in the world ( actually fairly thin plastic ) but for $ 5 what else can you ask for ? Should last a few months at least .	1
This is my favorite pedal ... and I have a ton . Lots of high end pedal and this a cheap ( only in price ) pedal ! Great bluesy tones ... .sweet and warm when the drive is down ... mean and nasty when the drive is cranked up . Like a cranked tube amp . If you play the blues ... this is your pedal . I 'm sold . I 've purchased several JoYo pedals and all of them are built extremely well and perform as good as if not better than top name pedals .	1
These sell for about $ 20-25 in the real world . I paid a bit over $ 12 and it was an Amazon Prime purchase too . The display is better than most I 've used ( dating back 30 years ) . The best thing is that I can pass this around to band members quickly when they have a need too .	1
I had some band mates that did not seem to respect my Shure SM-58 mics very well so I bought some of these cheap mics to use on them . I was very surprised to find that I like the sound of my voice better through one of these than my old reliable SM-58 ( and these Behringer mic 's are about 1/10 the price each.No problem with feedback or handling noiseNo problem with electronic induced noiseSounds goodDirt cheapHandy carrying caseWhat 's not to like ?	1
I am a basic player and just starting to explore the possibilities of using a slide . this one works fine so far . it is rather heavy and I like that . I also like that because it is metal , if you drop it on the floor , it is not going to break like my glass one did . Be sure to get your correct finger size before ordering however . otherwise it may come too big or small for your chosen slide finger .	1
sounds great . Love the sound of this pedal but a few quirks . It does not work well with a daisy chain power supply . with this set up the second channel will distort a bit . Forget batteries . They last 5-10 minutes . With its own power supply sounds amazing esp when one takes in to consideration the price	1
I 'm primarily a guitar player , but I do have a decent mandolin that had factory strings on it . Those strings made it hard to play , so I tried these D'Addario mandolin strings . What a difference ! These strings are great !	1
I 've used this strap on different guitars and it works great on all of them . If you 're looking for an economical strap this will work great . My experience has been that Ernie Ball makes great products .	1
The MicroCube came with new AC Adaptor that supports 110V and 240V . Now I can take it along and use it in Europe/ Asia and USA.I saved $ 30 from buying another AC adapter that supports 240V.Happy Customer !	1
I have been playing for 9 years . Have owned many different guitars and amps , tube and solid state . Currently own and use ... Marshall JCM2000 DSL 100 w/1960b cabMarshall MG half-stackFender Super Champ X2 w/Carvin cabFender Frontman 212rLine 6 Spider III 120 Watt 2x10Kustom 35 Watt Combo 1x12Out of my solid state amps , this one sounds the best . In fact , this amp sounds great , gets plenty loud , is affordable , and is not some junk brand you have never heard of . Has a great clean tone with a lot of low end . Reverb sounds great as well . A little overdrive sounds good too unless you use too much , gets quite noisy and loses its clarity . Remember , this amp is NOT for metal . If high gain is what your after , then stay away . If you are into ANY other kind of music , then this amp is fantastic and quite good for the price . Also , unless your playing with a drumset , this amp is overkill as far as volume goes . 100 watts is not at all necessary for the bedroom guitarist . If you are into ANY other kind of music , then this amp is fantastic and quite good for the price . All in all this amp was a good buy and I recommend it to anyone in the market for a solid state amp in this price range ... .But this would n't be a very good review without having some cons . So here are mine . These are by no means deal breakers but I find them quite annoying.POWER SWITCH IS ON THE BACK ? -I find it annoying to have to reach around the back of the amp and feel for the power switch every time I turn it on . It is especially annoying if you are like me and have limited space and stack your amps on top of each other . With another amp sitting on top of my Frontman 212r , the power switch is even harder to get to.EFFECTS LOOP IS ON THE FRONT ? -The last thing I want to see on or around my rig is messy wires everywhere . When using the effects loop , one has to deal with looking at two more wires hanging down over the front of your amp when they could be hidden in the back . Not the end of the world but I just do n't understand why . Why Fender why ? FOOT-SWITCH JACK IS ON THE FRONT ? -This one is not so bad , but just adds more messy wires to the picture.REVERB IS NOT FOOT-SWITCHABLE.-Foot-switch includes `` Channel '' and `` Boost '' buttons . A third button for `` Reverb '' would have been AMAZING.CAB IS MADE OF SUPER CHEAP PARTICLE BOARD.-Not that I expected anything different in this price range , but the `` wood '' used is so soft , that you CAN NOT pick it up by the back . I could easily break a piece off with my bare hand if I wanted to , no exaggeration . I know because when I first got this amp I went to pick it up and I immediately stopped myself because I could feel it about to break. -- -BOTTOM LINE -- -BUY if ... -This is the best amp you can afford-This matches the sound your after-You need the 100 Watts to be loud enough for a drumset-You want the Fender name and sound without the huge price-tag.DONT BUY if ... -You play metal/hard rock-This is your first amp-You only plan on playing at bedroom levels-You can afford a tube amp	1
Arrived on time and as described . The strap is well made and suspect it will be around for some time to come . It is basic and not fancy . It does the job , is comfortable and the price is right . I have four of these Pro Tec straps having replaced all my old straps some of which date back a way too many years . This one has the pick pocket which seemed like a neat idea . So far forget to use it but that will come .	1
Great cable for patching in and rocking out . It is also low noise and very suitable for recording as well . 100 % Recommend to anyone looking for a good quality ( without an over the top price ) cable ! !	1
Actually arrived in the proper bag and looked great . Had issues before with company but they resolved all issues . I would do business with them again . Thanks for taking care of me . Pleasure doing business with you	1
Works great , does what it should , holds all my guitars securely . acoustic and electric , but not at the same time . haha	1
I love this it 's do fun to play with . Every pedal that I buy of joyo amaze me . They are well built with a sound that is beautiful for that price . I 'm sold out on joyo pedals .	1
According to the ad copy , this pedal `` replicates Full-Stack Marshall crunch . `` As the other reviewers will testify , it does indeed do just that.What I 'm loving about this pedal is that it really is very amp like . Dial back the volume on your guitar and it cleans up . Its responsive to your picking attack , its distortion is very very harmonically rich , and it does give you a Marshall type sound , good boost in the mids and bass , giving your tone the sonic density that those amps are famous for.Sad to say , it actually does the full-stack thing better than my ProCo Rat , which has for years been my favorite distortion pedal . The Rat is fantastic and I have no plans to sell mine , do n't get me wrong , but the Crunch Distortion can get the raging full-stack tones the Rat can , but has a tighter bottom end , less noise , and a more open sound than the Rat . Individual notes ring out great on the Crunch Distortion . Its a great pedal period . Its a darn guitar miracle at $ 40.As a side point , I play lots of Ramones stuff and this pedal , more than any other , gives me that awesome Johnny Ramone tone . I was running my gold-top with P-90 's into this pedal , then into the sparkling clean '65 twin reverb setting on my Fender Mustang II ( this pedal plays well with modeling amps , which is a rarity , let me tell you ) and with some tweaking I was getting a FANTASTIC Ramones tone , better than I 've ever got with my Rat , my Boss DS-1 , DS-2 , HM-2 , ANYTHING else I 've owned ( and I 've owned over 2 dozen other dirt boxes over the years ) . This is the pedal that finally did it , it just nails that cranked 70 's Marshall stack sound.My hat 's off to Joyo . They made a fantastic distortion , one of the very best I 've ever played , and they 're practically giving it away . Buy one , you 'll use it , you 'll love it , you 'll be happy you bought it .	1
very good item if you are a musician you need it ! cool for any bass , guitar and any instrument that fit into the hanger	1
It was recomended that I get new strings when I bought my violin and these worked great . They are steel coiled so they were fine with my electric violin but did take some time to stretch a bit to hold a tuning which was a bit discouraging at first . They 've been great since .	1
I have been buying this string for many years and will continue to do so john View tips and guidelines | Headline & 20 more words required.///	1
This guitar strap performs as expected for it 's price . Great entry level guitar strap for those just getting started ( or for a backup strap ) .	1
Apprehensive in buying let alone using but glad I did . Not an everyday product - but when your strings still have their tone but have lost a bit of their glassy feel . . . start to feel scratchy , this is a quick fix until you 're ready to re-string .	1
These work just fine as replacement mounting screws for single-coil pickups mounted to a pickguard , though they seem to be too thick to fit through the standard holes in a humbucker ( nothing that a little drilling out could n't fix , if you 're so inclined ) .	1
Great sound and sensitivity . Very well made . These should last a lifetime barring any physical damage . Made in the USA to boot ! These may not be the cheapest but they are worth every penny !	1
Having purchased many & # 34 ; A & # 34 ; frame and more & # 34 ; traditional & # 34 ; style stands , this one has quickly become my favorite . Not only is the padding much better than the rest of them , this thing is very sturdy and the casters actually work . Only thing lacking a bit is the instructions , but it 's easy enough to put together that they are n't really needed . I 'll probably be buying a second one for the rest of my guitars soon .	1
Nice bag with great features . It is slightly large for a Telecaster or Stratocaster but works fine for either.I actually swapped another bag , putting a Les Paul Jr in this one and a Tele in the Gibson bag as theGibson bag was a really tight fit for the LP JR. headstock .	1
I have two of these stands , the electric guitar/bass version and the acoustic version . Back to buy a second electric guitar version as a spare or to keep in my guitar case . Yes -- folded up it WILL fit in my tweed Fender electric guitar case alongside the neck of the guitar ( I DO always keep it IN the included stand bag to ensure I do n't scratch or bump it against my guitar ) . Great at this price too , buy several !	1
Works great with my Fender Super Champ X2 amplifier . However , it does not come with a cable . I would highly recommend .	1
Ca n't play any instrument that has wood pegs without having a small bottle of Peg Drops . Though I do n't know why they do n't put guitar type turners on violins , cellos and bases	1
Was upgrading the chrome on an MIM . Perfect fit . Used Switchcraft jack . Includes screws and 1 washer ( for the jack ) . Looks great .	1
its a patch that goes over the spot where your beater beats on the bass drum , guess it provides some useful purpose like kicking thru a bass drum skin , came with a few which is nice , price was right , so why not ... go for it ! ! !	1
I 've been playing guitar for about 15 years - and within the last year bought my first Taylor guitar ( Taylor Guitars 414CE-LTD Grand Auditorium Acoustic Electric Guitar ) . It came with these Elixir strings on it from the factory . I am blown away by the brightness and purity of the tone these strings produce . What 's even better is how long they last.I 'm pretty hard on my strings . I useDunlop Standard Tortex Picks , 12 Pack , Purple , 1.14mmwhich are very stiff , and chew up strings very quickly . The nanoweb wrap that they put on these string makes them last several MONTHS instead of weeks . They 're a little bit more expensive then other major string brands . But after about a year of listening to these ( only gone through 3 sets so far ) , they 're worth the extra few bucks .	1
Unfortunately , the first one of these I ordered from Amazon arrived with two of the bottles having leaked their contents all over the place . Take two ! The second set I received was in great condition , and I 'm really surprised with the amount of product you get for the low cost . This kit literally has everything you will need ( except new strings of course ... ) to keep your guitar looking and sounding great .	1
I use this microphone mainly to record music . Occasionally I use it for voice chat where it supposedly excels in quality compared to desktop USB microphones . I think the best way to describe this microphone is that it is & # 34 ; above average & # 34 ; but does not outperform any higher-end non-USB microphones that I have played with in the past . While it is not an & # 34 ; outstanding & # 34 ; microphone , it 's still a great entry-level product for those on a budget.The microphone is relatively easy to use ( just plug in the USB cable ) but it needs some accessories to be efficient . For instance , the stand that comes with the microphone can not hold the microphone upright . It seems like it will tip over if you breathe on it the wrong way . Remember to buy a solid desk ( or floor ) stand for the microphone , as well as a shock mount and a pop filter .	1
For the price of these I am very happy with the purchase . I feel it sounds really good and has many settings . I think the build on these are fine for daily use . Do n't expect it to break anytime soon anyway .	1
I 've never been much of an effect pedal guy ; lots of batteries and cables when I can just get a good tone direct into my Fender tweed . I 've recently conceded to using more effects and have gone , quite frankly , hog wild on new gear . This is the best of the pedal purchases I have made so far , it 's not quite the MXR sound I was going for but there 's definitely something here . The boost works very well for lead work and really ups the sustain on my Strat.Just two controls , one for volume , one for compression . My only concern is that the knobs feel like they could be much more sturdy , I have n't pulled them off yet but I would guess the pots have plastic posts as opposed to metal ones .	1
I really like the delays and the reverbs on this pedal , i recomend this model , it will work if you need a lot of effects in one box , it really sounds great , the distortions sounds great too .	1
Great as a booster , as others have said . For solos , it 'll boost your mids and your signal . As an overdrive , it 's great , kind of a midsy , Marshally sound . It does suck out some of the low end , but you can fix that on your amp or board or whatever . It 's a Boss , it 's solid - and a great price . Remember , this is overdrive - not distortion . For distortion , look at other Boss pedals .	1
... but it works fine for me.I used to connect a Orange Micro Terror Head AmpOrange Amplifiers Micro Terror MT20 20W Hybrid Guitar Amp Head ( Standard ) to a cabinet PPC108Orange PPC108 1x8 '' Speaker Cabinet	1
Works great . It 's lightweight but VERY stable , even with a heavy bass drum mic.A great bargain for a very sturdy , useful product .	1
XLR cables are hard to mess up ... these are great . They do the trick . Why bother making your own cables when you can buy them already made this cheap ?	1
I had trouble with strings going out of tune too often . Installed these Fender locking tuners , and voila ! ! ! ! ! Amazing difference ! ! ! Re-stringing is much faster now , and tuning is fast ( no long loops around the tuning pegs ) , holds up much longer , rarely need to re-tune now , even after lots of bending and vibrato . ( I love the Ernie Ball Super Slinky 9-42 strings and Fender stainless steel 9-42 strings also ) .My opinion is every Strat benefits from these tuners , they should be standard on both the MIM 's and American Strats .	1
The product feels a little on the `` cheap '' side , but definitely does the job the way it should- so that 's all I care about . It was cheap , and came fast . I recommend it .	1
I was surprised at the good quality for such a little price . It does exactly what I needed it for .	1
I 'm pretty new to using mics and PA systems but have used dynamic mics in the past , recreationally . This condenser mic is way larger and heavier than a dynamic mic , I was surprised when I took it out of the box . It is as good looking in person as in the pictures . Three things for the benefit of other newbs : 1 . ) I learned that condenser mics are very susceptible to moisture and so you have to purchase a windscreen if you 're going to use this for vocals , since moisture from singing into the mic can damage it . 2 . ) This has a cardioid pickup pattern ; you do n't sing directly into the end of the mic like a dynamic mic . This should stand straight up on a mic stand , paying attention to which way the mic is facing since it there will be a lot of attenuation on one side of it . 3 . ) It requires phantom power . You need a PA that provides 48V power to use it.When I first used this mic , I tried singing into the end of it and could n't hear myself very well . Later in the evening I was standing off to the side and could hear myself so loud that I had to back away about a foot from the mic . Then I remembered reading about the cardioid pattern and stood it up straight on the mic stand , paying attention to the orientation of the mic . It was so sensitive that I really had to stay backed up from the mic and it was easy for two or three people to stand around it for vocals . I have a Rainsong WS1100 acoustic electric guitar I was playing , and was able to turn off my amp completely because this mic picked up the instrument and my vocals so clearly . Other musicians were impressed by it as well . I payed just under a $ 100 for it , which I think is a great value for this product .	1
A great universal bag . I can put everything in this bag from my 12 string to my hollow body . Has great pockets to carry your picks , strings , and tuners . The padding is better that I expected . It does have a red strip on this if your concerned about color .	1
If you have n't used these picks , get some . They are the perfect size and shape . Your really ca n't beat them .	1
Happy to have Black connectors on an XLR cable that does n't cost a ton . I use these for a short run to my mixer from my Line 6 Pod . They work great . Not the greatest mic cable , but for the price they ca n't be beat .	1
ConstructionThis Amp certainly looks sharp . It is not nearly as heavy as I would expect a 100W amp to be , but seems well put together.ControlsThe III comes with a 2 button Foot Pedal which feels very solid and works perfectly . ( You can expand to add an optional 4 button switch that Fender sells separately and also includes in the IV and V. ) On the amp , you have separate EQ knobs ( Treble , Mids and Low ) you have a gain , a volume , a Master Volume and a Reverb . Along with these , you also have an LCD screen that tells you which amp model you are using with witch pedals , presets , delays and reverbs . You also have separate buttons for changing Amp models , reverb , delays and modulation effects . The large knob on the top actually scrolls through presets , and once you press it , you can go into deep editing of the amp models , effects and presets.The controls are intuitive and easy to use . It is a great mix of visual digital feedback as well as tactile knobs.Comparing to other amps : The Fender GDEC 3 does not have as much deep editing available on the amp itself . You need to use your computer to edit and download settings properly . But on the Mustang III , you do not feel that you are missing out on editing functionality by not keeping it plugged into a computer.I do n't know of another amp that has controls that are both as intuitive and as powerful.The Sound ( Most important ) Let me first compare this amp to what Line 6 , Vox , and Peavy have offered in the past . All of the companies that have gone heavy into the amp modeling offer endless numbers of sounds and effects ... BUT ... How many of those sounds are useful for guitarists who are learning and trying to create sounds based on music that has inspired them ? Line 6 offers tons of sounds ... most of them are what I would call `` niche '' sounds that are only useful when recording a weird intro , or some crazy effects laden sound . What I find with Line 6 is that their vintage tones are very digital sounding and sound over processed . They do n't sound overdriven , they just sound distorted . Also , Line 6 offers oodles of sounds for progressive rock , metal , and maybe even some weird jazz fusion . These sounds are unique and interesting , but the vast majority are of no use to someone like me who is learning to play the songs that I love and looking for useful rock , blues , and metal tones.What I can say about the Mustang III is that the tones do not sound digital or overly processed . The Vintage amps have some great overdriven types of sounds . These are very passable sounds and fantastic models of the Real Thing . You can find the actual base amp models in memory banks 88-99 . By playing these sounds you get a real feel of what you can do to the amps . A few of the sounds that are simply amazing to me are : '57 Champ This amp model sounds so convincingly cool just like a little 8 inch Champ . Tons of character and tone . You can get some really cool vintage type blues sounds through this amp model . Think the Jimi Blues cd . The presets that use this amp that Fender created are all really fun and sound amazing.Fender Bassman Wow ! You can get some great bold rock sounds out of this amp model . It has the recognizable tone of the Bassman modeled really well . Big Bold bottom end with some singing highs . '65 Deluxe is a fantastic all purpose amp model . Throw an overdrive pedal on there and play some great classic rock/blues . Or leave it alone for a beautiful clean tone.The British Amps are all good models of Vox and Marshall type amps . They are all bold and in your face . Just play one ACDC riff into the 70 's amp and you 'll recognize the sound.As far as the Vintage tones go ... I dare you to find anything that models vintage tones this well anywhere . If you play rock , blues , Country , hard rock or Jazz , you have so many great choices . People who play in churches will love the variety of clean tones for your lighter stuff and good overdriven rock tones for faster paced songs.What surprises me is that Fender has strongly marketed this amp for people who play heavy music . I was worried that the heavier amp models would not be nearly as good.I was wrong . The 90 's stack can get nice and grungy or crunchy as you like it . I 'm pretty sure that this is a Mesa Boogie type of model . This is certainly your Metallica amp.The 2000 metal is for all of your nu metal needs and can be pulled back a little to play some cool thrash sounds too.The BIG bonus for heavy guitarists in my opinion though is the SuperSonic . This amp has a lot of great character and you can make it bluesy or really make it heavy and bold to play metal , thrash or whatever . If you overdrive it with a built in pedal , you can get some great raw and heavy tones out of this . I play some metal and hard rock as well as the classic and blues stuff that I like . I personally will play all of my heavy stuff on this SuperSonic amp.The fact that you can take any of these basic amps and layer effects and pedals on them gives you absolutely infinite combinations of tones . You can have one guy who sets all 100 presets with vintage tones , and another guy who has all of the presets filled with metal and thrash . It is limitless.I would , without a doubt choose this amp over ANY modeling amp out there for practice and fun.I own a pimped out MIM Strat , and a off-the-rack Classic Vibe Strat and Tele as well as a Les Paul style guitar . They ALL sound very cool on this amp . The Classic Vibe 60 's Strat really impresses me through this amp . So versatile with so many great sounds and such a high quality sound . I am really loving it ! This amp can play really really loud with it 's 100 Watts , but you can also play it with great tone at very low volumes . ( I have 4 kids and practice at night , and this amp is perfect . ) Fender Fuse and Ableton SoftwareI have to admit that I really do n't feel a lot of need to dive too much deeper into sound editing than what I can do manually on the amp . However , You 'll find amazing tones all over the Fender Fuse . The system is super easy to use and store on your amp . As with any open online forum , you will have to wade through tones that you do n't love and are n't described well . But you will find some gems too.I have not had time to dive into the ableton recording software yet , so I will have to save that review for later.The FINAL WORDI am a Father of 4 who needs an amp that sounds great at low volumes . I like Vintage tones as much as Heavy stuff , so I like a variety of tones . I hate overprocessed guitar tones . This amp is perfect for me . Perfect . The amp models are great , and the factory installed presets are a great variety of usable sounds . It comes with a built in tuner , tap tempo effects , a two button footswitch , an effects loop , a digital interface , deep editing computer software , a headphone jack , a usb port , recording software , and moreAt $ 299 This amp costs less than effects pedals that friends of mine have purchased . I have a $ 300 strat that I love that sounds beautiful through it . After buying it , I have listed a Tube amp and several effects pedals that I have loved because I no longer will play it.There is no better modeling amp for my needs !	1
NS ( Ned Steinburger ) Capo is different than your traditional Kyser style capo . I really like how it is designed , where it conforms to the neck nicely and feels more a part of the guitar than other capos I have used . It boasts minimal string bending across the frets , where it will stay in tune better up and down the neck . I tried this out and , sure enough , their claim was true . I capo'ed from the 1st fret up to the 10th ( where I would actually never use it ) and tuning stayed pretty much accurate . There is also a nice slot in the capo to put an extra pick in , just in case you drop the one in your hand . Overall , this is a great product and I give it a high recommendation and five stars .	1
This is the most awesome loop pedal ever ! ! ! does the trick perfect , you can remove and add in elements to your loop ! super small , only potential drawback is that it can not be battery powered .	1
Works great and does a good job , a must have type tool for the price get one ! ! ! Light takes up little space and easy to use .	1
I got these for my dad for Christmas . He loved them all and wo n't quit playing with them . I figured he would put them into his collection of cool things he 's amassed , but he uses them daily to play the Ibanez acoustic/electric I got him .	1
These strings are just prefect and feel awesome . As you can tell from the amount of reviews on this product they are extremely popular.. and all those people can not be wrong	1
Excellent tuner . I appreciate it 's compact size and often leave it attached to the headstock . It performs as it should and appears to be quite durable . Being able to angle the unit is great . The back light works well in dim light and of course the piezo mode makes tuning in noisey invironments quite easy . They do mean it when they say to replace the battery when you get it . Mine lasted for a couple of weeks . It was insightful of them to tell you of this need upfront . All in all well worth the money and the transaction went flawlessly .	1
These are very nice looking guitar picks . I 've used these and do n't have any problem with them.Thanks , Austin Garcia	1
These Capos are wonderful . Perfect all the way around ! long lasting and backed up by the company . I have three !	1
In this price point - it 's a good capo - if you know how to put one on and use it . I use it for lessons in case a kid steals it - so I 'm not losing my G7 capo which was $ 40 . Great capo .	1
These are my go-to strings . They are perfect for gig use and are inexpensive as well as awesome sounding . What more do you need ?	1
This chromatic clip-on tuner is the best of the best . One can not go without having one for the price . I 've tuned violins , guitars and ukelele 's with it . This is an electronic gadget you just can not do without . You can use the vibration setting to tune with a room full of people talking or playing other instruments . If you have it on the MIC than you can tune many instruments all at once if you wish.This little instrument tuner does everything . FOR THE COST ... YOU JUST CAN NOT BE WITHOUT ONE .	1
use them for home recording , nothing on the road . for that purpose these are made well . wouldnt use these regularly for gigging wear and tear would break them down pretty quickly .	1
new to playing slide guitar I have lots of fun with this one it is fragile so care must be taken as to not drop it ... would buy more from this company	1
These do a great job at passively eliminating noise while allowing you to hear your metronome ( or a mix from a soundboard ) perfectly . They are certainly worth the price .	1
These are amazing . I 'm an intermediate player . Have been for the last 30 years . I tend to have sweaty hands and loose grip . Every other pick I have used has turned in my fingers ... loose grip , little sweat , slick finish . Ok now ... thin ? med ? heavy ? You can choose the stiffness just by where you hold the pick . Incredible how the stiffness will change depending on where you hold it . And I can even hold onto it . Very nice grip on these . I have to keep getting more cuz everytime I hand one to someone to try , it 's the last time I see it . Just hit Add to cart . You wo n't be sorry	1
This daisy chain worked very well for me - no problems yet . I 'm powering about six pedals currently , and I am able to use more than one without any problems or change in sound . I think this is a great way to power some basic effects without breaking the bank , and it should work with any single spot A/C adapter you might already have , so no need to buy another .	1
A fine inexpensive assortment of thicknesses for the beginning guitarist to choose from.A great deal for a nominal amount of money .	1
I 'm not a big fan of pedals at all , I much prefer multi effects but , that being say this is a great cheap pedal . Does what it should just like the noise gate in my rack .	1
TC just does things right . I love how easy this is to use , the incredible clarity of sound , and 5 minutes of recording time . I do a single , duo , and full band . It goes with me to all gigs and I do use it for when I am practicing . Highly recommended solution .	1
Im a man on the move and am constantly away from home . I take this bad boy with me everywhere to satify my need to pick 6 strings . great for takin to the beach or on the boat or to entertain yourself on long car rides .	1
I know that pick choosing is a personal matter . I choose this specific model because the thickness and flexibility are perfect for me .	1
So far I am a very satisfied customer with this cable . For what is worth , while I have used these cables before , this is the first one I have ever owned , so I am no expert .	1
I have used these strings since they first came out . D'Addario make the best strings out there . I am sure there are others who do a good job , but you can actually hear the difference . It does n't really matter which you buy - they all sound different - as in better ! !	1
I bought pedal power 2 in order to use on my latest board build . This works perfectly and is actually fairly small for a power supply . I would say it is just a bit bigger than a pedal . It was easy enough to connect all my pedals and run the cables . My board looks great , works well , and I love this power supply	1
Summary for those who do n't want to read the whole thing : This is more than worth the money . If you 're a beginner looking for a first guitar or if you 're experienced and are searching for a backup/travel option or anything like that , get this . Do not hesitate . A cheap guitar does n't ALWAYS mean a POS ! Alright , full story/review : So , when I was a kid up until my early teens my ( insanely talented and self-taught ) older brother helped me learn how to play guitar . I got pretty decent but somewhere along the way I stopped and I 've regretted it basically every day ever since then . Recently , I decided to stop internally griping about it and realized I should actually DO something about it . So , here I am.Having previously lived in a house with multiple guitarists , I have heard the sounds of expensive guitars and I have heard the sounds of the cheapest guitars ( like a typical beginner 's First Act ) . I knew there was a middle ground and I was determined to find it . I got way more than I bargained for.I began my quest knowing that my funds were limited . There was no way I could afford to dive right in and buy a high end , top of the line Fender or Martin like I had had the benefit of learning on back in the day . I knew I had to go cheap , at least for now . I began scouring the internet in search of the best rated budget guitars . After an exhaustive amount of research , I chose this one due to the positive reviews and because all of the demos I 'd pulled up on YouTube were excellent . Plus , Epiphone has a pretty good reputation in general.Despite the positive reviews , I was still a bit leery ; buying instruments without actually handling them first is always a bit of a gamble . Even if it sounds nice and plays well , sometimes a perfectly solid , functional instrument just does n't FEEL right . As I went through the checkout I silently reminded myself that I could send it back for any reason . I went into this fully knowing that there was a good possibility I 'd just have to bite the bullet and buy something better , even if costlier.Well , it arrived earlier this week and I am not disappointed . I certainly did n't expect perfection and I was convinced that I would find some kind of error , if only cosmetic , with such a cheap guitar . I am here to tell you that I have not found anything wrong with it . Even if I had ( unless it drastically affected the sound/playability of the instrument ) , it would still be worth the price.Along with the guitar I bought some new strings ( Martins ) because 9/10 times the stock strings that come on instruments are awful . I was pleasantly surprised to find that the stock strings are more than usable . I see that some of the other reviewers disagree . Maybe their strings were older or maybe it 's just preference , I do n't know . All I can say is that the stock strings on my guitar were not at all corroded/old . Shockingly enough , the guitar was pretty close to being in tune right out of the box ! It does n't seem to have any trouble staying in tune , either . All of that being said , it would n't hurt to pick up a pack of strings just to be safe . I mean , I 'm sure that when I do finally put the Martins on I 'll be even more mind-blown than I already am with the way it sounds.This guitar has a full , rich sound , plays comfortably ( the low action helps ! ) , and has zero issues with buzzing or dead frets . Oh , and contrary to what other reviews have said - YES , it DOES have a truss rod . While we 're talking about its positives , let 's not ignore the fact that it 's also super attractive with its shiny black finish . There is n't much about it that would give away its price . No , it 's not a $ 1000 guitar but it certainly does n't play like a $ 100 guitar either ! I do n't regret this purchase at all . Even in the future when I progress and upgrade I will definitely be keeping this lovely gem ! If you 're still unsure , do what I did and listen to some demos on YouTube . I doubt you 'll be disappointed . ( Pay no mind to the reviews the guy on the GearWire YouTube channel did . He clearly does n't know what he 's talking about and I , as well as everyone else in the comments section , was sure to express my feelings about that , haha ! One user even claimed Epiphone should sue him ! ) Check out the video reviews by the users/companies GoldHat3 , SamAshMusic , GigGear , and ShadowFW.My only complaint about this guitar is that I did n't buy it sooner ! Good luck on your search , I hope this review has helped !	1
Depending on the amp and guitar you have , this pedal is going to either really be great or be a bummer . It sounds terrific with my fender strat ( single coil ) Danelectro ( lipstick pickups ) on my solid state amps , giving them a warm tube like overdrive.It sounds terrible on my tube amp and my vintage silvertone amp , it really sounds aweful with my 1980 's Kramer , loaded with humbucker pickups.You 'll either love it or hate it ! That will decide mostly on the type of guitar and amp you use , it 's a different pedal with every combination .	1
These have good tone , but I ca n't see much of a difference over other brands at the same price point . I initially experienced buzzing after the string change with these but I needed to adjust the truss rod . Came in a timely manner from Sam Ash . Thanks !	1
I love this product ! It is very cheap and the spray bottle makes it very efficient for distributing an even ammout of product on your guitar . You end up using just the right ammount . Would definately recommend it !	1
I can not express how over sized this pedal is - it 's ridiculously big and it 's unnecessary.if you are lacking space on your pedal board u may want to look elsewhere or retrofit the insides into a smaller housing as i will do.Again - please be aware of the dimensions - this thing is soooooooooooooo hugeit sounds good though - though it does rob tone	1
These pick have a permanent , fine coat of rough finish over the translucent material . It wears off and smoothens out around the tip on usage but that does not affect the tone . In fact , I found it increases speed . These are perfect for a fast-paced style of picking . The tone is bright and snappy ! Good quality material ensures I wo n't be needing another set for a long time !	1
As several of the previous posters astutely mentioned , 'you will need a noise gate to use this pedal ' . I completely agree with that . And it will sustain your notes . It will actually raise the volume to make them sustain . But you will have extraneous hiss when the guitar is not playing to cover it up . The only way to get rid of this hiss is to use a noise gate . I use the NS-2 when I use my chain of pedals . That said , this pedals has some wonderful uses . Every note will have the same volume . You can hit the chord as hard as you like or as softly and it will play at the same volume . You can set it to sustain for days . Again , you will need a noise gate . There is nothing transparent about THIS compressor as there is almost all of my other compressors , but none of them are as `` ACTIVE '' as this one . Perhaps that 's the price you pay for what this pedal can do . I recommend messing with it quite a while . You can do some incredible funk , jazz , metal vibes out of it .	1
I use Dunlop Orange because the thickness is perfect . I hit the strings very , very hard and these picks are heavy enough to get the job done yet I do n't break many strings .	1
It seems redundant to review again except to point out I have bought more and will buy more . I will have one for every instrument stored with and actually on each guitar inside it 's case . I have given out 5 and kept 4 - I have 11 working guitars - I need 7 more Snarks ... .. some have had their batteries run down in under a year - but I get close to 2 years off a new battery - ( Batteries are a bit costly )	1
I have already laid down 8 tracks and the process is effortless . Easy export to Protools for final mix but the internal tools are sufficient for a decent working demo .	1
they connect my pedals and with very little signal kill . good buy for the price and nothing else is required . good quality with sealed connectors .	1
Bought a couple of these to build pre-loaded pickguards for strats . They work just fine , nice solid feel , screws included , and white or black tips . There are two rows of connectors	1
I 've owned several poor quality foot rests in the past and needed a new one . This one exceeded my expectations and for the price is an excellent value.I 'm 6'2 and weigh 225 . There are numerous adjustment angles that I can switch to and be comfortable and I 'm not concerned about the legs bending . The photo makes them look weaker than they are .	1
ino ... u wana buy one of those 9.99 cheap pedals from ebay n the likes right ? ... NOPE ! ... cause when yeh doits gon na flak out after about the 10th push you do on it ! ! ! Listen to the Voice of Experience grrr ... .hahahthese pedals are frikn TANKS heavy duty all the way and have a polarity switch [ and yeh there 's alota keyboards out thereu gota have that perc ... It 's worth it ... just suck it up n get the thing and if you still need a momentary dsp switch then buy the lil 9.99 jobbut only use it in life or death situations..hahah [ they have a really cheap plastic switch thats destined to die no matter what..at least the previous 2 i bought did ... *ouch ... * so is that like 20 hail mary 's for that confession ? ? ? ? ... ... .	1
I have some neurological problems with my picking hand , and ca n't seem to hold onto picks . I really like these Max Grips a lot , and have found that they are excellent for soloing . Great tone as well . For my tastes , they are are a bit stiff for strumming , but perfect for everything else . I love the size and would n't want anything larger . The advantage of these over the Dava jazz picks is that if they do move about in your grip , you can still pick with them . The Davas have a rubber coating over the grip part and can only be used on the sharp side . I would say the Davas are slightly more flexible ( literally , not figuratively ) . I use the Dava jazz for more rhythm oriented playing . Can not recall how these picks are with my acoustic , as I 've been on an electric fixation lately.Also a fan of the regular Jazz IIIs and find they do n't slip as much as my Dunlop Tortex picks . I think this is due to both the materials of the pick and the raised lettering . Still , in terms of grip , they do n't hold a candle to the Max Grips . Both picks have their own unique tonal character.I 've tried a variety of picks and I think that once you get used to smaller picks , you will find the larger styles feel clumsy and awkward . These jazz picks are also great for pinch harmonics . They are just a bit difficult to adjust in my hand on the fly because they are so grippy.Overall , these are my picks of choice , for my style , which is blues-oriented . Surprised there are so few reviews.EDIT : The strumming issue can be overcome with playing around with pick angle . It 's getting easier with these . I have also since found that while these are fantastic picks , I actually prefer theDunlop Jazz III Pick Pack , Red Nylon,1.38mmdespite lack of the Max-Grip raised lettering . They are just the most wonderful picks I 've used . I do plan to try out some 2mm picks , however , as I suspect I 'm going to prefer a thicker pick ; the III nylons feels slightly thicker than the Max-Grips , which I believe is why I prefer them .	1
I only use Dunlops . For a number of reasons . First , the texture of the plastic gives a good sound , and easier to hold on to . Second , the `` grippy '' texture they put on them makes them easier to hold on to . Thirdly , they make many sizes , for all the right occasions . Two thumbs up !	1
I liked the features this recorder has BUT it is a chore to figure out how to use them all.It let me know that I am not a techy . For me not so easy to get beyond the basics . It does a nice clean job for the recording I have gotten done .	1
I like this string winder , and it is convenient having the wire cutter there too , but the & # 34 ; bridge pin puller & # 34 ; is too small , and does n't work on my instruments . That 's why I gave it 4 stars instead of five .	1
While the Nanowebs are coated and then coiled , the Polywebs are first coiled and then completely coated . They both feel very , very smooth to play and the sound is amazing , I mean really amazing . The Nano 's sound is not quite as smooth and rich and heavy as the Poly 's . I would recommend trying both types for your electric guitars . The Nanos may sound better for you on a hollow-body electric , and the Polys may sound better for you on a solid body electric ; it 's a personal preference like anything else . The Polywebs though feel and are really smooth and give you a really fat , mellow , sweet sound .	1
Reduces string noise as promised . Makes slides much easier to accomplish with ease and less noise . I think they also do reduce some finger soreness as your fingers are n't as irritated from sliding on bare strings . Makes them feel kinda like elixirs , but sounds a lot better and you still have the naked strings feel . Also does make the neck a lot smoother . I will be buying more for all my guitar cases .	1
I can not shower enough praise on the LPB-1 . It currently sells for about $ 40 and improves your sound when combined with any other pedal ( especially overdrive/distortion pedals ) or on its own . I keep it on all the time , since it always improves sound-quality .	1
I bought these strings to replace the strings on my Hofner acoustic . The gauge is pretty good for a deeper tone . I might try a lighter set next time , but these have a good clear tone from low to high , and are fairly comfortable .	1
Have been a user of Jazz III picks lately ( Max Grip version : Dunlop Max Grip Jazz III Carbon Fiber Guitar Picks - 6 Pack ) but was having some difficulty with those picks during rhythmic sections that required lots of strumming.Was recommended to these picks by other users so I gave them a shot . A few of my notes : - This pick is very slightly bigger than the Jazz iiis i linked above . I like this a lot . The tip is almost exactly the same size , but the top grip area is ever so slightly bigger . Still , these picks are significantly smaller than your `` average '' size pick.- The rubber grip area is a joy to hold . Very comfortable , very stable , lots of grip- If you did n't know , Dava picks dont come in varying thickness . They are instead `` control '' picks . Meaning depending on where you grip the pick it will become more or less rigid . Look at the picture -- - see those three horizontal lines in the middle of the pick ? Those are reference markers -- - choke up on the pick ( lowest line near the tip ) for leads and pull back for more flexible strumming . This will take me some time to get used to but it is pretty nice in theory . However , even choking up on the pick , it is not as rigid as the jazz iiis and sometimes for fast work I was wishing I was still holding the jazz iii.- These Dava Jazz come in three colors : Red ( Delrin material ) , Yellow ( Nylon material ) , Orange ( Gel ) . Different materials produce different sounds/feels . Also , in my opinion , the gel is a little harder than the other two.Hope this review helped	1
I purchased two Fender instruments , a mandolin and an acoustic guitar , each of which came with a Fender clamp-on tuner with similar functionality , but I thought to give the Snark a try . I have n't used the sound versus vibration mode much , nor have I done much with the metronome function much -- I ca n't speak to them ; however , I am very pleased with the vibration tuning . Compared to the Fender , both will get your strings tuned well ; what I like better about the Snark is there is a almost no dwell from the last note stuck before the next note registers . With the Fender , I feel I have to wait a few seconds for the screen to clear before striking again , and that adds up when moving from string to string . The Snark is bulkier in the soft gig bag ; the trade-off is any easy-to-read display . Lately , it 's become my go-to tuner .	1
This is exactly the item I needed for my podcasting rig . It holds my Behringer mixer along with my compressor and my vocal processing box . It lets me move the whole thing easily out of the way when I need to use my table for something besides podcasting.The stand is easy to assemble and is very well built . There 's nothing bad I can say about it , if you need to hold some audio gear then have no reservations about picking one of these up . Highly recommended .	1
These are high quality cables , both construction wise and in audio quality . I use these shorter cables if I have to run bits of my rack to external amps/units , ie : unplugging and plugging in a lot , and I find these cables stand up to more abuse than the average cable . I 'm satisfied .	1
Just trying to find a midi to midi was a task , and you have to make sure the pin config is correct . This one is a good product and works just fine	1
I have recently come back to the guitar after several years on hiatus . I have several bad habits , including a tendency to need to grip the pick too tightly or I drop it at some point . On a bit of a lark I bought a pack of the Clayton BeeHolds ( 0.5mm , ) and really like them . The hexagonal hole really does make them stay in place with much less grip required , and I find the hole to be in a very natural-feeling spot . The pick is fairly long , but I have not had any accuracy problems with them , and so far durability has been good.I still use other picks too , but I really like these and ca n't imagine not keeping an ample supply on hand .	1
I do n't think I can say enough good things about the Samson SP01 Shockmount . Long story short I was trying to get a podcast going from scratch about three months ago . I did some research and discovered that a shockmount is necessary to keep any noise from anything securing the mic from being picked up by the mic while recording . A shockmount is an absolute must , especially when looking at using a tabletop mic stand where the table will also be used as a work surface.The build quality is fantastic . I just recently purchased my THIRD shockmount for an additional mic to be used on the podcast.What I 've grown to appreciate so much is that it seems to fit just about any condenser microphone I can get my hands on . If you are considering buying this for your own condenser mic , make absolutely sure that your mic has threads on the bottom to be screwed into some type of stand or shockmount . Nearly all do , but some companies like Blue ( Snowball , snowflake , etc . ) are designed not to be used in conjunction with shock mounts . I have used the MXL 007.USB with this shockmount as well as the AT2020 USB and XLR version . The MXL fit like a glove , perfect . The AT2020 , once threaded in , seemed just a bit loose , so I added a couple foam bumpers around the base to act as a washer . It made a tight fit and further insulated it from any sound interference from any movement.In short , I have n't found a better shockmount for condenser mics . The attachment screws onto any desktop tripod and traditional mic stand . Fantastic . Buy two of these ! ! : ) Thanks Samson , now just make better mics !	1
This pedal work , although I find it a little bit cumbersome in my particular setup . My issue is really only one of cable routing though and will be remedied soon enough . The M195 does perform as it is suspend to although it does play word with my delay pedal , even running the delay on the output side of the M195 . The noise gate is quiet and smooth an would be vital to many with a high gain setup . I run mine in my pedal chain for my bass rig , when using fuzz and distortion .	1
This works very good on a silver flute . It 's soft and will go along time before you feel like you have to launder it . Would purchase again .	1
I have been using the EXPs for some time now on electic-acoustics and they have become my go-to string . I find the coating to be less noticeable than on El***rs and tonal variations to be less from string to string and set-to-set . Highly recommended .	1
When I look down at my dirty scuffed up old pedal board and see these patch cables , so bright and festive , I just FEEL beautiful all over again .	1
Very accurate . When I wanted a G I got a G. I have such a refined ear , that I only have this around if I have a head cold , or you know , do n't want to show off , but it 's a good tuner .	1
I do n't know if this is a common problem , but i have these on both of my basses , and one of the arms that attaches to the actual body of the instrument is starting to show some sort of blemishing , like metal does before it rusts , it is literally only one of the arms out of 4 i have so i think it was just a random thing . The problem is that it makes it so my strap does n't just spin free in it so the screw keeps getting loose , and one time ( the first time ) i did n't notice and it actually fell out . Notice i still like the product , this was just one of those things i think , so I would still recommend it .	1
This is a great guitar hanger that was recommended to me by several people . Great for people with babies/toddlers looking to get their guitars off the ground like myself.I love the unique self-locking mechanism that it has . The weight of the guitar lowers the hanger and moves the lock levers up so your guitar neck is securely fastened . I have an electric and an acoustic hanging up . The acousitc 's body is about 4.5 '' thick and has plenty of clearance from the wall when hung . The electric I think weights around 8 pounds and it held no problem by the Hercules hook . I believe the max weight it can hold is about 15lbs.I only installed into studs and would n't really want to try a drywall-only installation . The product does come with drywall anchors but many of the reviewers said the included drywall anchors are cheap and not that good . The wood screws that came with the product I found to be a little short ( if you were installing on dry-wall in front of a stud ) . Others found this to be true too . I bought # 8 Wood Screws in 2.5 '' length at the hardware store and these worked perfectly for my install . The included screws I think are about 2 '' in length or a little less .	1
If you buy a ukulele , and it does not have these strings , you should replace them with these strings . Strings make a big difference in any ukulele .	1
While I love and trust D'Addario strings , i am subtracting one star because , I really like the packaging for other strings when they have individual packets . For my acoustics , I do not always change out all the strings at once . I think the bass strings get changed more when they start falling off on sound.Anyway , these are classic strings that I grew up with , but as I get more involved with playing , having the flexibility of individual envelopes for each string becomes more an d more appreciated . Especially if you like to save your single strings for use .	1
Peter Piper Picked A Pack of Purple Peppers - test passed , no & # 34 ; puh & # 34 ; sound to be found on the recording .	1
I have little doubt that the Blue Icicle will get the job done with a Shure SM-58 , or similar `` dynamic '' microphone . But its claim that it will convert any `` condenser '' mic , even one that normally requires XLR connection and phantom power , into a `` plug 'n play '' USB mic should not be taken at face value . I say this because I have an acquaintance with the original Audio Technica AT2020 Condenser mic who had intermittent and marginal success when he tried such a conversion . In the long run , he would have been ahead ( in terms of both the conversion and saving a few bucks ) by purchasing the AT2020 USB mic . As it is , the Blue Icicle is probably the best such converter on the market ( the comparably priced LightSnake cable will not convert condenser mics , despite what you may have read ) . So , if necessary , give it a try -- and more than one . But make sure there are return privileges .	1
This is my favorite acoustic guitar stand . It 's easy to use on stage , it can be used with only one hand , and it has a low profile that does n't take up a lot of space when folded , and it does n't stick out as an eyesore on stage . I use this thing constantly , and can wholeheartedly recommend it .	1
There is n't much to get excited about in a guitar stand , however , it does it 's job and the price was right . I purchased four and they were all delivered on time . Each adjusted to , and held , its guitar securely . I have found the stand to be very stable . The welds seem secure ad the materiel heavy enough to do the job . My music teacher has a similar stand which cost him 4x as much . It 's does not appear to be of better quality .	1
came in oversized boxes but were packaged securely and easy to set up and hold my guitar and bass right out of the box ,	1
My hubby and I decided we wanted to learn to play the uke , so we ordered this set based on decent reviews . Wonderful . We learned to play thanks to this kit . While the instrument itself certainly is n't of high quality , it is more than adequate and has a good sound . The real jewel in the crown 'tho is the instruction book . Fab ! It is highly informative , easy to follow , and has some good songs in it . I still use it for reference and do not pick up my uke without that book nearby .	1
I do n't know if it lives up to all the hype and mystical powers of the all-mighty vintage tube screamers of Ibanez , but it is an exact clone including the same component values , potentiometers , ICs ( JRC ) , etc.For proof that it is exactly the same , I was able to modify it for different frequency response ( corner frequency ) , and add asymmetrical clipping with the exact same components in exactly the same spot in the circuit as seen in TS9 mods . Of course the board is layed out a little differently.The only reason I gave it 4 ( really 4.5 ) stars was because it does produce some noticeable noise ( hiss ) at higher gains , but this is expected given the boosting stage acts like a high pass filter ( this gives it the characteristic mid-range boost ) . It can be cut with the tone control , but it also may have been due to a poorly shielded amplifier , and or a one-spot power adapter .	1
Depending on where you hold it the stiffness changes . That comes in handy . They make another version which is less pointy ... I like that one a little bit better .	1
I 've been using these cables for more than 4 months and they are holding up pretty well . For years I used seemingly indestructable guitar cables that were made for me by an electrician friend . When they finally gave out , I got in the habit of using the no-name cables that are always on display near the register at Guitar Center- really more of an impulse buy than something I put any thought into . After the third or fourth Guitar Center cable failed from light use I decided to try these cables . Not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better . I am not terribly hard on my gear but my cables tend to get twisted as I move around and the cheaper ones eventually fail mid-cable . I do n't mind spending a few extra dollars if the cable is a little more durable . This cable is actually cheaper- $ 12 or so shipped- and it 's holding up pretty well . These are actually very reasonably priced for 18 ' cables . There is some kind of limited life warantee on this product but I have n't needed it . Five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs $ 12 shipped ! Incidentally- these cables are shielded and are meant to connect your instrument to your amp 's input . Do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab . You want to use unshielded cables for that purpose.Edit- More than 6 months has passed and this cable is functioning without any issues . The price on these things has gone up significantly and although the cable is highly recommended , there are probably better values from Hosa , Monster or Planet Waves-	1
Like all Gibson products , this is high-quality polish that one would use on a high-quality guitar . I have used Gibson polishes for 38 years ... .	1
I put this in a $ 200 guitar . I have a Recording King ( RD-06 ) that sounds so good , that I wanted to use it for live gigs . So I popped in this K & K . I ran it through my SWR California Blonde II acoustic amp . If you have been wanting an acoustic guitar to have that & # 34 ; miked & # 34 ; when you plug it in , this is as close as it gets ! I recommend getting a sound-hole cover if you play with a band , but you will not be disappointed . The installation can be a little tricky , but with a little patience and reading , anybody can install it . If you do n't feel comfortable , just go pay a local luthier to install it for $ 30 , or ask your grandmother for help : P	1
I 've had a few of these my life time because people always steal capos . What the hell . Anyway , this capo works well . I 've only used it on Gibson and Fender electrics , and it does a fine job . Some of the rubber padding will eventually come off as glue wears off , but it does not affect the capo-abilities . I 'm sure there are better ones , but for me , this works well .	1
it 's amazingly helpful during double pedal licks haha ! ! while you 're goin all out on pedals , you can just use the drop-clutch to make it sound like the hat is open OR closed ... depends on what you want . it 's really useful and I recommend it if you double pedal a lot	1
Great value and the heavy base easily holds a professional mic or instrument mic.Great Price ! Very Happy and shipped from Amazon perfectly with great packing .	1
I purchased this for my son to use on his acoustic guitar . I had previously purchased a fabric capo for him to use until I could get him a better one . That did not last long . I ordered this one and he loves it . It 's durable and works perfectly .	1
This mixer is awesome , I could n't get it where I live , so I bought it on Amazon , it works great ! ! I plugged my Shure mic , and my acoustic electric guitar to the Line In , and also my ipod to the 2track , and everything works great ! ! Great sound , with the right parameters , you just have to adjust a little here and there , and it will work great , so far no buzz or humm .	1
I replaced the original Indiana guitar tuners with the Fender Locking Tuners , and what a difference ! ! ! I had to drill some holes in my headstock , but that was accomplished by tightening the new tuners on and leaving an indentation from the feet after removing them prior to drilling . Then it was a simple matter to drill new holes and mount them . The locking mechanism is great ! It acts like a vice in a woodshop project . And all I need to do is put on new strings and lock them down , tune them , use the tremolo bar a few times to stretch the strings , retune a couple more times , and they just do n't go out of tune anymore , regardless of how many times I bend the strings . These are highly recommended for anybody who is tired of going out of tune .	1
If you need a tube screamer . You ca n't go wrong with the TS9 . The only reason why you should n't get it , is if it is n't the right tone for you . I say this because you ca n't say anything bad about this pedal . It sounds amazing . It just might not be your sound . I personally went with the TS808 because it compliments my amp better than the TS9 . People who say this is better than the TS808 or vice versa are choosing the wrong wording . They prefer it . It 's not better . Both are great .	1
If you have to have a strap on your acoustic guitar , I would suggest this . I have a vintage 60s Dixon Hummingbird . I was really worried about scuffing it up . Do n't worry with this .	1
I ca n't compare it ( as others have done ) with the OCD , but it simply gives me an overdrive that I love . I have several other OD pedals : Tube Screamer , LovePedal Kalamazoo and even a cheap Danelectro DS-1 . The JF-02 is truly my favorite right now . I 've been using it with a Strat and a Les Paul clone into either a Fender Vibro or a small Bugera V5 . It serves up great tones into either one .	1
Es el output original de fender.. que mas se puede decir.. producto de calidad.. me gusto ! Saludos a todos desde Venezuela ! !	1
It 's oil ... .what more do you want ? Turn upside down , squeeze hard , use your & # 34 ; man & # 34 ; level strength and soon the tip will darken , apply liberally to your fret board in a back and forth motion . IMMEDIATELY wipe your fret board clean just to take the wet look away . Let sit for a few hours then dry rest of the way rubbing with cloth.It 's okay to soak the wood as long as it 's momentary . Do n't saturate the fretboard and walk away , wood absorbs oil , too much oil absorbed = fretboard wood becoming swollen and buckling , losing shape and flatness . Not a good situation.Lemon oil is n't like other oils , it is n't very slippery and kind of makes things grabby . It 's oil but it actually works more like a solvent , cleaning things and making them sqeaky clean ... .like your frets ... hint hint.Just be sure to buff off all the excess and put a little string lubricant on your frets before you re-string and you 'll be a happy camper .	1
Got this for an SG-style guitar , and it fits with plenty of room . This is a better quality bag than an & # 34 ; average & # 34 ; bag , but with a couple of comments:1 . It smells like an industrial rubber factory upon opening.2 . The large , main zipper is easy to close but somewhat difficult to unzip . Surprised me because it 's a large-toothed zipper.3 . Construction seems to be pretty good . This is not a hard case , but to get a guitar from point A to B , it works just fine.4 . Padding is sufficiently thick . It 's not a paper thin bag , but it 's not thick enough that the guitar would survive a drop.Would I get another one ? Probably , as long as the use was long term storage or to travel small distances . Otherwise , I 'd get a soft sided hard case ( the new wave of Styrofoam cases ) or a regular old hard sided case .	1
The Acoustic Guitar Quick Release System is very interesting . I ordered this as a filler item for a much larger order , just to give it a try . So far so good . Thanks .	1
Was looking for something slightly improved over the Snark , but still easier to use and lower cost than a strobe tuner.Works well to quickly tune and still zero in on the correct pitch.Appears the tuner is a AW2 and the G ( guitar ) function is in that the clip fits a guitar headstock.Works as anticipated . Easy to get that last bit of fine tuning .	1
Never has 15 watts sounded so loud and clear . Never think it only hadan 8 inch speaker . Just enough effects to leave your pedals at home for practices.Light weight easy to carry .	1
I had been using 12 's on my S35 Takamine and they were over powering the chassis with vibration . The result was poor sound . Switching to these 10 's made a huge difference in tone . It took a bit to get used to the lightness but now I will stick with them on this guitar . They are also easy to do bends which I like alot . I have never broke a D'Addario acoustic string .	1
These are good for the average guitar player who does n't want to much strain or pain on there fingers . Not the fullest tone , but you would n't expect that with extra light strings .	1
Use this for home recordings and some voice over recordings for work . I like the long neck on it and its a double filter so you get a tad bit extra . I tested it against my single filter and it did make a difference , as expected . It makes sense that if you have an additional layer there it will filter more effectively , but I wasnt sure if it would effect tone or highs , and I didnt notice either effected .	1
I am quite pleased with this product . It 's relatively inexpensive , small and light weight . It operates on two AA batteries ( included ) . I use it primarily for a banjo and a guitar and the reference is easy to use and appears to be quite accurate . The LED and large meter allows these old eyes to see it easily . I should have ordered the CM-100 clip-on tuner at the same time ( placed a separate order later ) to allow to tune in a noisy music ( jam or band ) environment . You can fine tune your tuning with the calibration settings . There is also a 12 note sound generator built in for reference pitches . The metronome is pretty loud for the small size . I have a hearing loss , so if I can hear it , even while playing , it must be pretty good . The speeds are from 40-208 BPM . You can select between two modes PENDULUM STEP ( Preset values , 40,42,44 -- -88,92,96 , etc ) or FULL STEP which allows you to change incrementally by one ( 40 , 41 , 42 -- -206 , 207 , 208 , etc ) . Beat tap allows you change the time signature from 0-7 beats and also duplets , triplets , quadruplets and triplets and quadruplets without center beats . It has a 1/8 '' mini earphone jack for private use . It is possible to use the metronome and the tuner simultaneously . I bought mine from Austin Bazaar . Shipping was FREE and FAST . I give it five stars and recommend that you can give it serious consideration .	1
On Stage makes some very nice products . This music stand has all the adjustments as one of our favorite older units . Well made and the price does n't put it out of range for the everyday musician . Really am liking On Stage products , also bought 2 of their boom mic stands and they are excellent .	1
I like the Dan Electrode but I noticed dropping the voltage on some of my pedals really changes the effect ( turned my Heavy Metal into a sick fuzz and my LavaBox into a primitive distortion ) , and on others dropping voltage can mean a slight loss of sustain ( Onerr Overdrive ) or volume ( FrenchToast ) and thats it . It 's still a good 9volt power supply but the voltage drop feature does n't always 'wow ' you .	1
Purchased two of these , one for on stage headphones and one to actually use as a junction box to send the sound elsewhere in the building to other amps/speakers . Works in both environments very well , individual channel volume control is perfect . No hum/hiss from these units at all .	1
The reason I stopped using amp stands was because I could n't find anything collapsible and non-bulky . It works very well and is very sturdy ... I use it for a Hot Rod DeLuxe .	1
I replaced all the stock mounting screws that came with our sound rack cabinet with these , as they were nearly invisible with the black rails and mounting plates . The plastic washers also seem to protect the finishes better than metal washers on the equipment I mounted . Inexpensive , and worth it .	1
I use this with fairly light mics ( seeNady DMK-5 Drum Mic Packagefor details ) .While I generally do not mic bass drums , when I do this stand allows me to do it my way , which may seem unconventional to some folks . I place the mic on the batter side of the drum about three feet back . Since this can be problematic with the floor tom and throne ( and hi-hat ) hindering access , the boom and adjustability of this stand are a great help.Where the stand shines if micing amps . Some small amps , such as theFender Champion 600 Electric Guitar Amplifierare usually placed on a raised surface to keep them off the floor . This stand will reach any stand that is chair seat height . For larger amps that are on the floor or tiltback stands , this mic stand will still allow you to position the mic where you need it.My use is relatively narrow - kick drums and amps . But for each , this stand is excellent in my opinion . With the mics I am using it is heavy enough to remain stable , and for where I need to place those mics , it allows me to do so with relative ease .	1
I like the pedal . It 's totally silent , very bright display , sensitive meter . In fact , the only complaint I have is that the strum-every-string-at-once thing is n't as useful as you might think . Not that I ever use it . I 'd buy this product again if I had it to do over again .	1
Great , just as expected . Thank to all .	1
This hanger is very well padded and the padding can be adjusted to custom fit your guitar . It holds the guitar perfectly spaced from the wall .	1
I keep an acoustic out on a stand in my office to keep handy for when inspiration strikes . I used d'addarios for many years . I switched to these and their longevity is drastically more noticeable . they sound great too . The added expense is more than made up for by the extra long life afforded by the coating .	1
I like using these strap ties far more than I do tying a strap to the neck . They are a great idea . I found the button on the strap somewhat difficult to install the strap , but eventually got it on . I have two of these , and I use them . I 'd definitely recommend them to anyone who does n't like tying on their guitar straps .	1
I 've always been a fan of these Fender Classic picks . They just feel right , wear very well , and make a nice sound in conjunction with a good set of strings on my Telecaster . I also think the price is pretty fair .	1
I have 2 one spots which came with the 5 multi plug cable , after reading a little bit on the internet I read that the one spots can handle almost 10 pedals each ( depends on the pedal , power handling etc . ) So I saw they had an 8 plug cable and figured I would try it out . With adding many more pedals to my board , this is perfect . Def recommend if you have alot of pedals and only want to plug in once .	1
Behringer is a problematic company for me . Some of their stuff has been useful far beyond its modest , entry-level pricing ( e.g . A-500 Studio Amplifier , UCA-202 DAC , Eurorack UB-502 mini-mixer ) ... and some of their stuff has n't served me well at all ( e.g . GM-108 amplifier , BTR-2000 rack tuner ) .Across the Web , reviews for the TO-800 are uniformly favorable . Based on this , I purchased one instead of paying many times more for an Ibanez TS-808 . This proved to be a good decision . The TO-800 produces exactly the sort of sound enhancement that made `` seasick green '' justly famous : creamy smooth to raunchy depending on my whim.The same sound for a lot less money ? What 's the catch ? I 'm a musical hobbyist . The TO-800 will sit safely on my office floor and , most likely , never be actuated by my foot . The Behringer 's shoddy plastic case and flimsy little control knobs , for me , are not liabilities . If I was a gigging musician on the other hand , I 'd want the tank-solid construction of `` the real thing '' and its additional cost would be well justified .	1
I bought this mainly for the string cutter , although it has a peg winder and a bridge pin puller as well . At first I was skeptical because it 's lightweight and the cutting ends are not sharp . I was wondering how well it could cut the loose ends of strings . I 'm happy to say that it does an excellent job , much better than the pair of diagonal pliers I was using . It cuts the ends of strings easily and cleanly . It 's nice not having to carry the pliers around , which are heavier and a little risky to your guitar should you happen to drop it or accidentally mar your headstock . As for the bridge pin puller , I tried it once but it is rather ineffective . I think it was included more as an afterthought as it 's just a notched edge and ca n't really pull stuck pins . For pulling bridge pins without damaging the bridge I would recommend the Dunlop bridge pin puller which is inexpensive.Overall I give this 5 stars for the winder and cutter . I 'd recommend this to any acoustic guitarist as an essential tool to keep in their guitar case .	1
I placed these on my usa made ovation baladeer . Stays in tune well and does a better job than the stock Ping tuners . This is the industry standard and you wont be disqppointed . To those who say it doesnt stay in tune should have their guitar 's bridge checked as flaws in the bridge can cause problems in tuning .	1
As others have said , the stretchiness of this strap makes the instrument seem much lighter and I am less likely to get an achy shoulder when playing for long periods of time . It may take a few tries with different configurations of the attachable/detachable extensions to get it just right for you and your instrument , but do n't give up , it 's worth the effort .	1
These are by no means touring cases . They 're inexpensively made , which is a good thing because I hate to pay for a case that cost half of what the guitar cost and I do n't tour . That said , they do a great job at protecting guitars that are n't out on a stand . I 've got about a dozen guitars and when they 're not gon na be played anytime soon I want to put them away in something more substantial than a gig bag . These do very nicely for that purpose . They are certainly more than capable of taking an instrument to a gig , but I would n't put a pricey guitar into this case if I new baggage handlers or shipping gorillas were going to be handling it . So , I recommend them , but be aware of its limitations .	1
I 've only been using the yellow one so far ( only just started using them ) . But I like how the grip is strong cause of the rubber and the grooves . The colors and designs are pretty . As far as I can tell they are all the same width/thickness . For some reason I thought they 'd have different thicknesses from a previous review . And so far I have n't lost any , yay !	1
After reading numerous reviews talking about the exceptional volume and tone of this amp , for the price ( about $ 16- $ 17 ) I had to try it.When I plugged my acoustic into this , I was very pleased to find those reviews are accurate . First , let 's not expect $ 500 double 16 & # 34 ; sound from a portable 9v amp . Once that reality is recognized , it 's realized this puts out far better sound than one would ever expect from an amp this size and price.I would note that the sound you get out of this amp -- as with any amp -- will be directly relational to the quality of guitar and pickup you 're feeding from . I tried this on three different guitars and each one sounded significantly different . One had very rich tone , another sounded & # 34 ; tinny & # 34 ; , another had a passive pickup and required I turn the HoneyTune up quite a bit more than the one with active pickup . So it wo n't sound the same on every guitar.That said , if your guitar has good tone and your pickup is good , this amp is simply awesome . I 've had it only one day so I have n't put it through the test of time ... but first-impressions are that I will buy more of these in the future ( I need more than one portable amp ) .My sister visited and heard it right after I opened the box , and she was impressed as well . Neither of us expected this kind of sound from such a small amp . And I have to say , the aqua color is major retro . Got ta luv it.I 've been looking for & # 34 ; the & # 34 ; portable amp for some time . This is the best I 've found to date and the value for price is a perfect balance . I do n't know as I 'd pay the $ 40- $ 50 for this guitar shops often ask , but the Amazon price is perfect . : ) One last thing : Danelectro branded 9v battery included , same color as the amp . Priceless .	1
I 've been stringing my guitars with D'Addario for several years . While my jazz box is set up with heavy strings , my Les Paul goes lighter -- horses for courses , you might say . I 've been using D'Addario XL strings on this guitar for a while , although it 's the EXL140 ( slightly larger bottoms ) . But why not give these lighter strings a try ? The quality is obviously high . Tone is good , as is durability . If you do much complex chording , you 're going to miss the heavier string , but for shredders and pure rock players these are very nice . I 'll be going back to the EXL 140s , since I prefer the more positive feel of the larger string . But fat or skinny , D'Addario makes some of the best strings out there .	1
Yeah , the strings that it came with were terrible , but it 's an amazing guitar . I 'll admit I bought it because it was cheap so I could practice playing on it and not have to worry about it becoming damaged , but it sounds great and plays really well . I like how the wood finish is n't all slick , has a nice natural feel to it .	1
I bought these black locks to go on a black Stratocaster I built . I do n't use any strap locks but Schallers on any of my guitars or any that I build . I recently bought some Fender locks that worked fine but were too large for me and all of my existing straps would n't fit them .	1
Good leather good build , made to last and age nicely . I like leather best of all things it feels proper , and I like simple let the guitar stand out , keep the strap simple but elegant .	1
I 've been using this for my ipad for chord sheets as I play on a weekly basis and it has been great ! Being able to not have to use a music stand and having it right below me attached to the mic stand is really convenient . It grips really nicely and attaches itself onto the mic stand really easily . I 've owned it for a while now and have n't had any problems with it .	1
This stand is great for my 45lb Peavey 1500 . It is a light weight rack and I had to put the amp toward the bottom . I would n't put much more in it but it is exactly what I needed . I can grab the rack by the top bracket and move it around easily . Have n't tried gigging with it but if you are gentle I think it would work fine .	1
This gig bag is well worth the price . It replaced the cheesy gig back I received with my soprano ukulele , and I have much more faith that my instrument will be much safer now . It has extra padding on the bottom for when the uke is standing up , and has a pocket in the front for tuners and other small odds and ends . Get this gig bag !	1
I have been playing music for years and often I lose my picks during a performance . I took a chance on these picks a few years ago and since then not one have slipped through my fingers ! Best pick ever ! ! !	1
I chose this rating because even though it is an Epiphone , a Les Paul and affiliation with Gibson it is made in China NOT the USA as one would think by the name affiliations . I think that fact should be pointed out in the advertisement that is is NOT a USA product . When opened , the white pick guard as showen in the picture was missing from the body of the instrument but I did find it in the pocket of the soft carry case . The white pick guard should have come attached to the body from the factory . So someone messed up in QUALITY CONTROL . With that said , I find the finished look is fine without the guard , the tone sounds good when not electrified and the sound is good when electrified . I decided NOT to send it back because everything else appeared ok when using it .	1
This is a must have for musicians or even speech givers that may want to use a table for their music/speeches . It is easily mounted on the Mic stand and can be adjusted to your needs . I would not do without it now as it easily replaced my cumbersome music sheet stand . I am using it with my Samsung tablet and can also be used with my wife 's Toshiba tablet . Highly recommended .	1
Very nice guitar strap . I bought it for my ukulele and it works fine . Good leather and believe it or not made in Canada not China ! I would recommend this item for either guitars or in my case Ukuleles . Good value ! Great seller and fast delivery . Thanks Amazon for a great product !	1
I use this pedal mainly for the & # 34 ; church & # 34 ; setting in ambient volume swells . It has seven different reverbs you can choose from ( including reverse ) . So it will definitely suit your needs for whatever you require reverb for . It is ruggedly built and digital , which some will like and others wo n't . I like it . That said , I have taken a liking to other digitech pedals as well . They sound good and are affordable .	1
The main advantage of this recorder to me is that I can get a good result without knowing much.I 've made some surprisingly good recordings of choir concerts in various venues without any special knowledge , though I 'm sure knowing more would make my recording sound better.About the only thing you should absolutely learn is to set the mic gain correctly so you do n't overpower the mic . I do n't use auto gain.If anything I try to err on the side of low . Excellent low noise property of the unit means that , except some rare cases , I can just boost the sound later on PC and the result is still more than passable for my purpose .	1
I typically use planet waves cables but tried these and there just as great . Never an issue . No loss of tone . Never breaks or fails . Quality product for a good price .	1
I bought these because I really had too long of mike cords for my solo live show . And these are really nice cords if you have a home portastudio recording studio like myself . Who needs all the spaghetti to trip on all over the place ? I bought two because I use a Digitech Live 2 Harmony processor and two XLR mike cords are required to make it operational . Good price here too . Hard to find just 10 ' mike cords . Usually longer ones are only obtainable .	1
The US-100 works fine for my needs : rough and ready audio tracking with 32-bit Cubase 5 on 64-bit Windows 7 . My PC is for general-use with a non-studio configuration ( no mixer , non-phantom power mics , headphone monitoring ) .If you 're buying for a studio setup requiring phantom power or multiple inputs , you 'll need a separate mixer and/or standalone phantom supply . From the mixer you can cable to the US-100 's line input via RCA jacks on the back.There were a couple of hiccups during setup , but I do n't blame the device . It uses stock O/S drivers that loaded right up . The documentation is minimal and only covers up to Vista , but it 's accurate and you 'll manage with Win7 . On the Windows side make the USB AudioCodec your default recording and playback device to override any onboard or card-based audio and speakers ( I have Realtek onboard and 2.1 desktop speakers ) .I 'm using ASIO4ALL with Cubase and Cubase crashed a couple of times while configuring VST connections and I/O busses . Once configured however , it 's been solid.I 'd recommend checking out user forums for your particular software/platform to find similar gotchas and to set your expectations.On an XP machine , changing the default sound devices often means the hassle of toggling settings before and after launching the DAW . On Win7 , once I unplug the US-100 , the settings revert nicely to my desktop speakers . If I plug the US-100 back in , the settings revert again - very reliable . Even better , if I want to use Cubase strictly for MIDI , the software detects the change and I do n't have to reconfigure connections or busses . That may be a function of Cubase , so again it pays to research your particular software.While the US-100 is connected , you 'll hear nothing from your computer speakers and have to rely upon the US-100 's headphone jack or audio out RCA jacks . This is where the balance control is very helpful . It 's not a pan , it 's a center position gain mixing the computer 's output ( from within your DAW as well as outside system sounds ) with direct monitoring of your input signal . Very simple to use for overdubbing . Some people may prefer a hard left/right pan while overdubbing : I can live with the center mix though a switch to toggle a true pan would have been a terrific feature.If you do want desktop speaker playback after your tracks are done , there are a number ways to go : 1 ) Unplug the US-100 and restart your DAW . 2 ) Run a cable from the RCA outs on the US-100 to the mini-jack aux in on your desktop speakers 3 ) Run a mini-jack extension cord from the headphone jack on the US-100 to the aux-in.While using the headphone jack , the RCA audio outs are muted and vis-versa . Rather than having to pull out the headphone I would prefer a push switch that toggles the front to back output , but I can live without it.Again , the US-100 works great so long as your needs meet its capabilities . You ca n't rely on the product description or packaging to answer that . Fortunately there 's enough user-information out there for just about any setup it should n't be difficult to track down .	1
I got this to plug into my computer . It comes with a wealth of programs and amp combos . The unit itself works as planned even though i think i may stick with Sonar as far as a editor . Sorry Behringer maybe later . The quality and durability are there 100 % well worth what i paid for .	1
Well it 's a cloth and I use it to wipe my guitar . This is a fairly good size cloth at that .	1
I replaced an older Snark that I use all the time , but seems to be cutting out sometimes . I love this new one . It 's a bit easier to see the display .	1
no complaints . attaches firmly and does the job . Ca n't beat it for the price . Order this with eyes closed . Great deal .	1
This microphone 's quality is amazing . I just hooked it up to my PC ( Windows 7 ) and it worked no hassle whatsoever . Nothing to install or hoops to jump through , just works great . I recommend buying a mic stand of some kind if you really want to eliminate vibration or other background noises . The stand that comes with it is very stable , but it is low to the ground ( or in this case , desk/table ) so it may pick up some unwanted background noise ( computer fans , mouse clicks/movement , etc ) .	1
Fender guitars are made for tinkering -- they are basically just lumber assembled with wood screws . At any given time I have a Fender guitar taken apart , and these little finishing screws replace the pickguard screws I inevitably lose . Do n't get me wrong -- I am a die-hard Fenderista , but you got ta admit they are manufactured objects , not fine examples of the luthier 's art . That 's what makes them so much fun to play and modify .	1
I 'd been shopping for a music stand at local music stores , all of them at the cheapest price for this type with a solid backside are $ 45 plus tax . This item including shipping cost me only about $ 23 here from Amazon , and the seller Musician 's Friend sent it promptly , got it within 10 business days without any problems . I had no trouble putting the stand together without any instructions . The bolts are n't as easy to adjust compared perhaps to a more expensive stand , but I do n't care about that . It 's not hard to adjust , and most of the time I have it at a certain height , so no need to fiddle with it , but during a group performance , it did need to be adjusted for different people and that was ok but could be smoother . If you 're someone who needs to fiddle with the stand height constantly you might want to get a higher priced one that makes that easier , but if you are only occasionally going to adjust the height , it 's no big deal . Other than that , it is a solid and handy stand that meets expectations and does what it should , for 1/2 price off retail . Excellent . I 'm completely satisfied with this .	1
I put these strings on my Guild acoustic electric . I play mainly rhythm guitar to accompany my singing and do a bit of fingerpicking.The warmth of phosphor bronze strings suits my style and these strings have a great tone with crisp high notes and full rich bass ends.They are made by Taylor and all Taylor guitars come with Elixir strings . Saving up for a Taylor , in the meantime , at least I can afford the strings ! These are very good long-lasting strings . To me , D'addario are just as good . Things like strings and picks are subjective . Try different brands to find what suits you best . If you are a serious player with a good guitar you should definitely check these strings out .	1
These worked fine . The mistake I made was buying them hastily . I needed nylon core strings..not steel . My mistake . I loaded them up anyway ... .sounded great .	1
are hard to beat when it comes to durability . ( except the steel ones ) . I use it when I travel on a plane especially	1
I had to tune my guitar and I bought this . Well it works great . I got the sound I wanted .	1
I have been using a ZT Lunchbox Amp for about a year . Blindfolded you wo n't confuse it with a Marshall stack or a blackface Deluxe but for a small , portable , solid state amp it works as advertised . People that say it is loud are n't kidding but there are limits . The sound from the 6.5 '' speaker requires some space to develop . Up close it can be painfully loud but the sound is rather directional and it lacks bass . I use mine for practice at home and for low-volume band rehearsals . I played it once on stage , mic 'd through a PA , but was n't happy with the sound and switched to a tube amp with a 12 '' speaker.To me it sounds best with humbuckers but I 've played single coil guitars ( Fender and Gibson ) through it with usable results . If you are after clean volume you might be disappointed . It only gets so loud before distortion ( and noise ) becomes annoying . Players that use a lot of distortion ( e.g. , Metal ) will get a lot more out of this amp than players that need cleaner sounds at volume . While the ZT Lunchbox is n't as versatile as some other small amps , it is great for a `` one trip '' load in at rehearsals.One thing to consider is adding the matching ZT extension cabinet . It makes a big difference in two ways : two 6.5 '' speakers move more air and the doubled speaker cone area helps thicken the sound . Also , because the speakers can be angled and separated the area covered by the sound is increased . This is a big help at rehearsals . I point one cabinet towards myself and the other into the room . I 've tried using a guitar speaker cab , a PA speaker , and a PA floor monitor as an extension speaker but the ZT extension cabinet sounds best to me . It 's the same size as the ZT Lunchbox and they thoughtfully put the handle on the back so you can stack them.For an ultra-portable guitar ( or harmonica ) amplifier that can get decently loud the ZT Lunchbox is hard to beat . But if you are particular about tone you might find that a lower wattage practice amp with a 12 '' speaker works better .	1
I have used these mics more than any other in my mic arsenal . The kick mic 's base is beginning to fall apart , but I have used these things on the road all this ( brutal ) summer and the sound is still the same ... I have other more expensive mics , but often use these in clubs as a backup ( when the drummer does n't have a favorite or bring his own kick mic ) . While it can not stand up to say ( my favorite ) the D112 , it does the job and the overheads are the easiest o.h . mics I have tried yet . The tom mics work on guitar cabinets and the mounting hardware is still in one piece ( except for the kick mic mounting bracket ) after months of use . I would suggest these mics as a backup for your expensive mics.UPDATE : Now that I have been using them for a while I can say they are reliable , durable and sound good . My AKG drum mic kit sees more action than the Pyle 's , but the Pyle mics are always on hand to mic guitar cabs , percussion instruments like congas and whatever else needs mic'ing . The kick drum mic 's mount is falling off , but considering how many times these mics have been hit by errant drum sticks and dropped by inexperienced technicians , they are in great shape . These mics have more life left and I have gotten a good amount of use out of them to this point .	1
After playing digital equipment for years I recently got into analog ( pun intended ) starting with an overdrive pedal.I had always heard a lot about the RAT and I wanted to try it out.I played a Boss DS1 at a store and thought it was a decent distortion but found it too trebly and thin.The Rat with all the knobs on 12 oclock sounds like a great rock amp . Like a perfect marshall but with more organic-ness . It really has its own tone I must add . Fat , thick , smooth and saturated . It responds to picking very well and organically.As you move the distortion knob higher , the sounds gets more and more animal . Very thick and `` furry '' . The tone filter knob also is a very strong influence on the sound . With lower settngs the tone becomes more trebly and smooth and with higher settings it gets closer to fuzz . Very nice.A nice pedal to have to be sure .	1
Waited two months before reviewing my les paul 100 to make sure there were no issues . I am very happy with the guitar . It came well padded and was in excellent shape . It was set up well and has played well out of the box . Just did my first string change making sure I used the same gauge of string and did n't have to make any adjustments to the guitar . Played as well after the change as it did before . Was a little nervous about an online purchase and not being able to play the guitar before buying but when you live out in the sticks and it 's a major trip to get to a real guitar store you sometimes take your chances . Anyway it all worked out as the guitar is very easy to play , free prime two day shipping , no sales tax , and saved about $ 80 in gas it would have taken to make a trip to buy one in a store . The savings in gas and tax paid for about half of my new Mustang 2 v2 amplifier.The only thing is on the epiphone site it states all their electric guitars include a cable in the box . This one did not and from reading their forum it seems it is almost a normal thing for cords to somehow disappear before reaching the customer . It is not a big deal to me but I thought I 'd mention it for those thinking of buying a epiphone . When I ordered this one I was n't really sure if a cable would be included or not so I ordered one at the same time , I 'm glad I did .	1
This is a great package for beginners . I never played a ukelele before but I learned to play guitar many years ago . I have no idea on how to tune a ukelele so I downloaded an app called `` Easy Ukelele '' available in Amazon and Google Playstore for free . That is the only ukelele tuner I can recommend for beginners as it actually listens to your Ukelele and tells you when your device is in tune . I purchase this as gift to my son 's 5th birthday that is coming up in 2 weeks so I have not yet preview the DVD and CD that came with it . I did however , checked and played with the ukelele while my son is at school , sleeping or playing outside to make sure that it is properly working when he open the box on his birthday and before the return period runs out.My Review:1 . The Package : The box comes with the Ukelele , Beginners Manual , DVD , CD , carry pack , and 2 extra set of Ukelele strings . Tuner is not included so I advise that you either buy a tuner or download the `` Easy Ukelele '' app I mentioned above.2 . The Ukelele : The Ukelele looks and feels decent . It has a sticker that says made in china . It comes pre-strung but it is out of tune . I tuned it using the app I downloaded but it would not hold a tune . It is very bad that the sting gets out of tune before you even finish tuning all the other strings . Basically , the ukelele sounded like an out of tuned toy when you first take it out of the box and even after a few adjustments . Since the string is nylon , I gave it a chance to settle . I would tune it really sharp and leave it alone for at least 10 minutes or more then pick it up and strum on it and push the string from side to side . I actually position the tuner pegs horizontally so I can see if it is moving when the string gets more tension . The tuner pegs stays in place so I know that the problem is with the string . It could be that the string included is a cheap one . After doing this a few time on day 1 , I was able to play my first song I grabbed from the book ( Clementine ) . But after 1 song , you have to tune it again . I just repeat what I did for the next 2 days , tuning it sharp and leaving it alone and play songs . Yesterday morning I tuned it sharp before leaving to work and when I came back in the afternoon , I checked the strings and they are still tuned to the same key I left them in the morning . I played with it for at least 10 minutes just trying to learn the music from the book and I was able to play at least 4 songs without any problem . This morning , I checked the note again and they stay close to the G-C-E-A range . I could see this improving more as the ukelele gets used more . Even if I have to tune it every day I would not have any problem with it.So , for the reviews complaining about the device being out of tuned , just give the string a try to settle . This are cheap string that they included here and it will take time to settle in . Or you can buy a better quality string that costs around $ 9.00 for a set . Another place you can check is the tuner , make sure that it does not get pulled back when the strings tension . If it would not hold its place then just grab a philips screw driver and tighten it a little . That is an easy fix.2 . The String : As I mentioned above , it is a cheap string that needs a lot of adjusting until it settles . Even if you buy a good quality strings , I am sure that it will also need a few adjustment in the beginning . It comes with 2 extra set in case you accidentally snap the one that is already installed . The problem is that the extra set does not have a label so you have to eyeball it . From some research I found online they said that the Thinnest string will be the A string . The second thinnest is the E string , The thickest is the C string and the second thickest is the G string . The extra string package says `` Gangia Brand '' on it so I assumed that that is the brand of the string.3 . The Book : I just scanned the book and I could tell that it is written well for beginners . The songs included progress from only needing 2 chords in the beginning and they add more chords on the succeeding lessons . Each song have a chart on which chord you will use.4 . The Case : The case will protect your ukelele from dust , water and from getting dirty while you are transporting it but will definitely protect the device from being damage in case of a drop.5 . The DVD 's and CD 's : I have not tried the DVD and CD 's yet but the DVD 's I believe will have the lesson and the CD will have the songs on the books so you can listen to it and have an idea on how to play the songs on the book . I will come back and edit this item once I get the chance to watch the DVD and listen to the CD.Overall . This is a great price for the package .	1
This tool definitely comes in handy for anyone who works on a guitar . It gets the job done easily and very fast .	1
I once bought a guitar case that came with a variety pack ( from light to heavy ) of Planet Waves picks . Since then , I 've used nothing else.I 've found that the light picks , ( .50mm ) are perfect for me . These obviously do n't last as long as thicker picks , ( but still last a very long time ) , and they suit my playing style and the type of music I play better . The picks are comfortable to hold and are attractively designed in a faux mother-of-pearl style . I 'll definitely continue to buy this brand in the future .	1
This strap is very thick and heavy , which give you a good secure feeling . The heavy leather ends are difficult to get the buttons on the guitar through , but your know that they are not going to slip back out.The picture does not do it justice . I paired it with my black EPI LP and it looks phenomenal . I am very impressed with how nice this strap is .	1
Make sure you read the description of the color you are choosing . Most of them are plastic.I bought the ebony with pearly inlay . They look great , it is , indeed , real ebony with a pearl inlay.The pins are sort of an odd size ( not sure if there is a generic pin size ... ) , so they might work , and they might not . They fit one of mine perfectly , and another , not very well . I would assume they fit all Martin guitars well , because my experience with Martin is that their instruments are pretty similarly made in way of parts and quality.Overall , great bridge pins for the price , and they sounds much better than plastic ones !	1
love these strings , but I have always been and still am a fan of Ernie Ball , they just sound better , bend easier and have a longer life span , but Martin are very good too , I just prefer Ernie Ball , but they were sold out and I needed strings fast .	1
I 'll try to review the strings and not the instrument but that 's kinda hard for me to do . I 've been playing guitar since my Dad bought me a $ 7.00 , unknown acoustic 46 years ago . That should make me about 58 . He put some brand new humpty duty Black Diamond strings on it which pulled the neck up to where the strings sat around 6 '' off the fretboard . Well , they were n't very close anyway . The neck had no way to adjust it so imagine learning to play using heavy gauge Black Diamond strings a ways from the fretboard . I did n't know any better so I thought it was normal for the blood dripping off my bent crooked fingertips.Since then I 've been through a multitude of guitars and strings . I always wanted a Les Paul but my playing never improved enough to justify $ 2000.00 - $ 4000.00 . I started reading reviews on the Epiphone Les Paul 100 for $ 249.00 and they were running from 4.5 - 5 stars . I finally , after much self convincing , bought the ebony through Amazon . I 've owned Strats , Telecasters , cheapies , an Alvarez I think . I unpacked it out of the box , did a little tuning and this is absolutely , the most beautiful , sweetest thing I 've ever held in my life , ( except for the little lady of course ) . No kidding , I recommend this guitar to anyone even if it cost a couple of grand.Strings : The ones that came on there sounded great . I did n't put it down for a couple of weeks . Sounds great in the bathroom , good acoustics . I finally got the best out of that set of strings . I always use Ernie Ball on everything . They 've got a wrench to fit every nut in the house . I saw some Hybrids on Amazon and had never heard of them . I bought a pack of them along with some Super Slinkys , Regular Slinkys , Earthwood Silk & Steels . I put the Hybrids on the new Les Paul . They made it sound even better than it was . Chuck Barry , The Ventures , Clapton , set the LP and Fender amp right and the sound is just as good . The lower strings have a wonderful rich tone , they 're fairly heavy but easy on the fingers . The high strings will talk to you . I can bend the g-string easier than a Super Slinky . This is the only guitar I 've used them on but they sound great . I imagine I 'll stick with them for this machine from now on . Of course Amazon is always 5 stars in my book .	1
However I have found that there are much better prices out there if you just do some basic searching . Usually I do . My bad .	1
Like many others wanted the brand name pedal , drooled over it for years , just ca n't pull the trigger on a $ 130 pedal . Bought this instead and it plain rocks . I put my pedals through three tests , 1 ) playing alone , 2 ) Playing at rehearsal , and 3 ) gigs . This thing stands up nicely on all three . Using it with Am Sp Tele , Hiway 1 Strat , Squier 51 , Epi LP Spec w/p/90 and Fender BJ , Peavey Classic 30/50 . Sounds amazing in any combo . Using it as my gain along with the Joyo Vintage OD , for lead boosts . Killer set up .	1
First , I do n't like most distortion pedals because of instead of making my Fender Blues DeVille 410 sound distorted , they make it sound like it is amplifying a distorted pedal . There 's a difference . Think about it if you do n't get it.Second , I do n't like having a lot of pedals . I play in a rock/country band were we play music that sounds like Neil Young , Tom Petty , CCR , etc . Just simple and clean rock and roll with a mix of 1,4,5 chords and an occasional minor 6th . I just want an overdrive ( my Digitech Bad Monkey ) and my Arion tuner , but I need distortion when we do covers , AC/DC , Hendrix , etc . ( The DeVille can do Hendrix , if you turn it up to 7 . But of course then it 's too loud . ) Based on those criteria , the DigiTech CM-2 is PERFECT . The Classic `` overdrive '' setting allows me to sound like Hendrix or rocking Neil Young ( or any other rock band from the 60s and 70s ) . The Modern setting allows me to sound more like 80s and 90s rock , e.g. , Guns 'n Roses and Soundgarden.And this is important , both settings make my amp sound like IT is being overdriven . It sounds like my tubes are being pushed to their breaking point . It sounds fricken awesome . It does not sound like an amplified pedal.So I can use the Bad Monkey ( I 've reviewed it on Amazon if you want to read it ) for boosting my clean sound . I use the CM-2 if I want to play dirtier and for covers . Two pedals ( plus the tuner ) and I can play everything I want . I 'm happy .	1
Well worth the [ ... ] bucks i paid . Analog with true bypass . Easy to use with one knob . And has nice high quality chorus effect . MXR built like a tank . Works with my Boss DS1 AC adapter too .	1
At first it seemed stupid to buy wire cutters just for guitar strings , but these do work extremely well . They seem to be very high quality and easily clip guitar strings right to the tuner post.I do agree with the other user who pointed out the fact that they 're spring loaded open with no mechanism to keep them closed . That does make storing them a little akward , but again , I think this is the best product out there if you change your own strings.PS - If you are using scissors to clip strings ends , you are crazy - buy these things ...	1
I honestly do n't know how they can sell these cases for the price and give you free shipping too . I 've seen cheap quality chipboard cases and gig bags that cost more . This is a hard shell tolex covered case . They are sturdy , well padded with plush black lining , and look as good as cases costing much more . These cases are made for dreadnought guitars , and I bought two of them . One is for my Ibanez AK75G arcrhtop electric guitar and it fits perfectly . The case has 4 brass latches and one is lockable and comes with 2 keys . It 's made in China , but is n't most everything these days ? I would n't recommend it for airline/railroad baggage , but this case will offer ample protection and safe storage for your instrument under most other conditions . I do n't think you 'll find a better deal on a hard shell guitar case anywhere else . Do n't be fooled by the popular belief that more expensive is better . Do yourself a favor and save a few bucks by buying one of these great cases !	1
Fits very well on my les Paul 100	1
Basically , this case is very sharp looking - made with good quality materials . The inside of the one I received was grey fur . The case would probably take a beating over time , but its not a SKB case . Nice enough that I would n't check it at the airport . Survived a trip in a moving van from Philly to Boston.Would definitely recommended if you need a case that your Les Paul fits very snugly and safely into .	1
This is supposedly a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box . I can not comment on this as I have never played this pedal . What I can say however with 30 years playing experience is that this is a very good pedal . When one takes into account the price it is a great pedal . I own this the classic overdrive and the ultimate overdrive by joyo . This has the most distortion . It has a nice ragged edge to it and is great for classic to hard rock . It does have a bit of noise at high gain but much less than the boss stuff I have had experience with . It is solidly built and apprears road worthy . great pedal and great value . I would have no hesitation buying this or any other joyo product	1
I brought this set beasue one of the strings broke on the kid size guitar , and I also wanted to have backup strings . I have n't tried many different strings . I have used the strings ( D'addario EXP ) that came with on my Takamine GS330S , and it 's been good for year+ . IIf the strings break , I will try this one GS330S as well . Over all , I think D'addario is great for warm balance tones . After the strings were set and `` stretch '' for few days playing , it stays in tune . The strings were set for more than 6 months , they still are playable , and the sounds are okay on kid size guitar . I do n't think there will be any problem if the strings are on my GS330S . I 'm happy with the purchase and the quality of the strings .	1
Adjustments are easy to make and the fit/feel is fine . No fancy designs , but a great value for the price .	1
I 'm updating a previous negative review . I had some issues with this guitar when it arrived . I could n't get it setup , the action was very high and I could n't set the intonation . Notes at the 12th fret were very sharp , and I could n't lower them with saddle adjustments . I missed one vital checkpoint , the bridge needed to be lowered . Setup is finished , and I can now agree with most reviewers . For the price , this guitar is far better than any others in the price range . I know my grandson will enjoy it , at least for awhile . If it ends up as a dust collector , I 'm not out much on the purchase price . I 'll add it back to my own collection , and upgrade the electronics .	1
It 's a short boom , but it works great . I really like the way it locks with interlocking teeth rather than simply tightening .	1
I love these pedals . Inexpensive to purchase - easy to mod to your liking.This pedal received the gain and JCM mod.I will purchase more of these and will mod each and every one of them.This pedal is also good stock for a lead boost . Love this pedal .	1
I have many heavy guitars . Yet wide guitar straps are for old men and blues posers . I 'm neither . However , my back was still hurting , and I 'm definitely a weakling . So I bought this shoulder pad . Now I only look like a weakling to the more eagle-eyed people who see me play guitar . Thanks Planet Waves ! Really , though , it 's quite good .	1
Great Price , easy to transport and set up and it holds my guitar . It does what it is designed for . Ca n't ask for more !	1
This tuner is way better than my earlier tunners which relied on either sound to their microphone , or direct plug in for electric instruments . This has the microphone feature , but is better used with the clip on vibration mode . Just clip it on to your guitar head , and hit the string . A multicolored display shows if you are sharp or flat . Easy to use .	1
This Jim Dunlop 210 Dunlop Bottleneck Slide is basically a glass tube and so far seems pretty durable . I will not get it to describing this specific product in detail because , well , its just a tube . I think I already mentioned something about it being sturdy.A bottleneck slide is always nice to have one to replicate someone else 's guitar sound or create your own . Whether you get brass or glass is your preference . Yes , they do have different tonal qualities , so you may want to try or buy both.Happy playing . Cheers ! ~J	1
I am upgrading my Chinese Fender Strat with American Hardware . I own an American Strat too and plan on making the best of the Chinese one . Going to upgrade electronics and everything else too.These are exactly what 's on my American Strat5 stars	1
This thing is awesome ! I think it 's the best tuner I 've owned and it really does an excellent job . It 's easy and clear and everything a tool should be . It 's fast and easy just like a tuner should be .	1
I got this for our church . I got sick of seeing the guitars against the wall . They where very easy to put together and now the guitars are off the wall and sitting on the stands perfectly .	1
These were great . I ca n't brag on them enough . I AM however an electric gitty player primarily . I just use an acoustic when on trips and for couch songwriting .	1
I really ca n't say enough positive things about the Apogee JAM . Not even 3 years ago , I would have considered recording into an iPad or iPhone to be a & # 34 ; novelty & # 34 ; , and the interface products that most people use to hook up your guitar as & # 34 ; gimmicks & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; toys & # 34 ; . Now , as of 2013/14 , we have so many quality modeling programs , recording DAW 's , and AudioBus to connect them to one another . Whether you 're a budding professional , or just a hobbyist aiming to record your own covers , the Apogee JAM ( usually around $ 99.99 ) deserves a serious look.PROS -Extremely easy to use and widely compatible -- & # 62 ; No batteries required . You get a small plastic converter with an 1/4 & # 34 ; input ( for guitar cable ) on one end and a digital output for 30-pin connector , Lightning , or Mac cables , all of which are included . Virtually any serious guitar recording app in iOS ( GarageBand , Agile AmpKit , AmpliTube , JamUp XT ) will recognize and work with the Apogee JAM right out of the box.Crystal clear digital sound -- & # 62 ; The sound quality you get through the digital input is markedly better than using the headphone jack as an input . You 'll hear your guitar as it 's meant to be heard , and with far less hissing and junk in the background.Considerably less feedback -- & # 62 ; This was actually the primary reason I decided to upgrade . My Positive Grid JamUp Plug was n't disappointing me in sound quality , but there was so much additional noise that went with it , it would easily cause my modeling amps in Agile AmpKit+ to feed back . High gain settings ( even something basic like a Marshall JCM900 ) were practically unusable . Even with clean settings , I had the noise filter turned WAY up , and that still did n't thwart the feedback issues . The Apogee JAM cured ALL of that instantly . When I first plugged it in , I was n't even sure it was on because I expected to hear constant hissing in the background . What I assumed was a fault of the software was actually due to a poor interface . The JAM 's improvement in avoiding feedback , alone , made it worth its price.No & # 34 ; crosstalk & # 34 ; - When you do multi-track recording with a headphone jack splitter , you get a bleed-over effect referred to as cross-talk . Basically , you are using the headphone input to monitor and play along with your track , but due to poor circuitry , this also gets fed back into the & # 34 ; armed & # 34 ; track you are recording . Some people are bothered by this more than others , but it makes quality multi-track recording quite challenging . I have n't noticed any of that using the Apogee JAM whatsoever , since it is a digital connection . ( You can still monitor your playing using the iPad 's headphone jack separately , obviously ) .Gain control and LED gauge -- & # 62 ; Not a feature unique to the JAM , but I love how it 's implemented . When you first plug in the device , the LED light is blue to show that it is hooked up , but not being utilized by software . Once the input is active in software , the light becomes green . However , as you play and hit harder notes , the light may change to yellow/orange , or even red . If it is getting into the red , your input level is too high , and may overdrive the signal . You adjust this right on the JAM using a roller dial . I tend to aim for a setting where the light is largely green and starts to touch yellow only in the more aggressive parts . Works well.CONS -Price point is a little high -- & # 62 ; Admittedly , I was n't thrilled about having to spend $ 99.99 for what I was already doing with a $ 20 headphone jack . That being said , I researched all of the alternatives and repeatedly heard that this was the best . If I knew it would be as good as it is , the price would have been of little concern . Also , there are n't really any quality DIGITAL options that are significantly cheaper.Lightweight plastic design -- & # 62 ; I actually have no problem with the build quality of the JAM , or that it is made out of plastic . At the same time , the fact that it is relatively lightweight means that your guitar cable may pull it off of a table . I also would not advise stepping on it if it happens to fall on the floor . But they do include two velcro strips to fasten it , and it 's a problem you can address with common sense.Highly recommend the Apogee JAM . It 's a mid-level priced device that services everyone from complete amateurs to recording professionals .	1
Dunlop capos are functional and inexpensive . Come on , capos do n't have & # 34 ; tone. & # 34 ; Just get one that does n't get in your way . Also , the people who work at Dunlop seem like nice guys . Thank you , Dunlop , for keeping it real up in Benicia .	1
Great for the desktop and vocals . I have also used it successfully on the guitar cabinet . It 's an important component in my studio .	1
This was EXACTLY what I needed this being the 3rd compressor I bought . I use it for vocals it drops bass a little is super quiet and has a mid range bump . So happy I got this ( I got a used one and its in perfect condition so that was a bonus too ) Behringer rules !	1
I have stayed clear of using pedals for most of my playing carrier ( over 40 years ) , but after installing a Fernandes FSK-101 Sustainer kit and getting the same results as most other guys : Too much sustain on adjacent strings which makes the whole experience a joke , I decided to go ahead and try this compressor out and am very happy with the results . I play mostly clean ( jazz , blues , rock ) and this unit gives me at least twice the sustain as I would normally get without any pedals .	1
This is an ingenious clutch that engages when you step on your hi-hat pedal , but will drop to the closed position when you hit the lever on the top . This allows you to either ride closed hi-hats when using both bass pedals , yet return to normal hi-hat playing when the music calls for it.Be aware that this clutch has only two positions - open and fully closed . However , there is a way to work around this if you like partially open hi-hats in the closed position for a sizzle sound . I did a work around by placing a spring on the hi-hat stem , with metal and felt washers on the top of the spring , which gives me that opening when I drop the cymbal to closed . There was a lot of trial and error finding the right spring because each cymbal pair has a different height when mated together , and I was looking for a tiny fraction of an inch opening . Too small or low a tension a spring and stickwork chokes the sound . Too large or stiff and you will not get the sound . However , this is all personal preference , and many drummers ride a fully closed hi-hat anyway , which makes this clutch perfect out of the box.Regardless of your hi-hat style , if you are using a double bass , this is a `` must have '' accessory . Gibraltar 's model is solid , heavy duty , and engages and disengages perfectly every time .	1
Works great . I did n't use the monster size wall board screw and it holds fine with the small furnished screws . Next time I 'm buying the all metal one and daisy chaining them to a board so I do n't have to make tons of holes in the wall for my half dozen guitars . For now I 'm hanging one on the wall with this and it 's fine . Wood is nice quality . I notice the price is almost 2x as much if you walk in the guitar center .	1
I still operate in an analog environment quite often , so I end up using lots of inserts . I have 8 channels of compression , limiter , gate and expander , plus various EQs and effects processors that need to be routed and applied to specific channels . I have an insert snake that I use as well , but the individual insert cables ( of differing lengths ) that I carry are lifesavers that make me a more efficient soundman during setup and a more flexible soundman during the show !	1
Works well , has many options of reverb and tweaks on all the options . I would recommend this pedal for an inexpensive reverb .	1
This was one of those `` might as well get one of these too , while I 'm at it '' purchases when I was ordering guitar polish . It 's a good cloth for polishing , no more to say about it .	1
OK , so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists . I 've been playing for about 30 years now and have used many different brands an types of pick . There is no 1 perfect pick for everything , depending on what your playing and your playing style you 'll want to choose different thickness and materials . However , I have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick . My hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor . I also really like the Nylon material . It produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar . I like the playability of the .88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues . I Keep a stack of .60mm for a more raw , folk like sound . In any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be .	1
These Snark tuners are ruggedly designed and really do the trick . I use the mic instead of the vibration setting though . That 's my preference . But I would use no other tuner on stage . I have one on each of my guitars including my acoustic guitars . I have dozens of guitars !	1
works exactly like its ad says it would , eliminates pops and secondary noises in the background , easy to install , nice looking	1
I never use slide to play my guitar , this is the first I ever have , look like good quality , I just have to learn how to play ; - )	1
this thing plays great ! ! action is low but does not buzz , very easy to chord.i highly recomend this guitar .	1
Recently acquired an Ovation mandolin , which itself is hardly & # 34 ; standard & # 34 ; in appearance , materials , etc. , so I thought it would bea good opportunity to try a & # 34 ; non-standard & # 34 ; strap . I 'm impressed ! I 'm thinking of picking up another for a more classical mandolin ...	1
This is a great value ! I was able to record some very good quality guitar tracks using this . It does n't sound exactly like an sm57 , but it will get you close . You can EG your amp to compensate for the difference .	1
This a great instrument cable . If all you have ever used have been rubber covered try this one . The fabric cover eliminates the knots and twists of & # 34 ; regular & # 34 ; cables .	1
This is a great stand . The ability to adjust it and price point sold me on purchasing this unit . I would recommend this to anyone looking for a desk stand .	1
Not only are they inexpensive , but they hold up very well . I have a ton because I keep one on the end of each guitar . Furthermore , they are very accurate as well . SO worth it just to not have the hassle of finding a tuner every time I want to change tunings.Bottom line : Inexpensive , well-made , accurate , time-saving . Buy it now .	1
This hand full of picks saves your fingernails , they are not the best , but easy to fit to the fingertips though the thumb picks that came are not the size I am used to .	1
At last I got this mic after doing about a month of homework on which condenser mic to go for . If you 're debating between the Blue Yeti , Snowball , Samson C01U , and this mic , there are plenty of reviews on youtube and google . At2020 was the most common one that people liked regarding affordability and sound quality .	1
I figured at this price I would n't be able to use this strap to secure my Dean from Hell guitar . But figured if it was n't up to being a reliable strap for my expensive & pretty heavy ax that I could always use it for my Rock Band guitar . And I 'm rather certain that this strap will outlast the Rock Band guitar . So very pleased with this strap & would recommend it for any beginner with a inexpensive guitar that 's likely 1/4 plastic and very lightweight .	1
These cables are just what I hoped they would be . They work well on my electric and my acoustic . Happy guy here Thanks	1
My son uses this for practicing at home with his electric bass ( Jazz Band ) and his standup bass ( Chamber Orchestra ) . It is solid , yet flexible in height and angle . Assembly was a breeze . This is the classic music stand in schools and is also excellent for home use . Built like a tank . Should last forever and can be passed down to the next generation of musicians in the family .	1
One of the best stands in the industry ! Fits any guitar , banjo , or even a cello . Good construction and easy to put together.How can you beat that !	1
So stiff . Nothing short of a five pound weight will cause this extension to buckle . If you sing and use effects pedals for an instrument , and ca n't rely on a good boom microphone stand being at every venue , get one of these and throw it in with your gear .	1
This product has turned out to be great with few exceptions . It comes with three amplifier software packages and says you have the license to turn on any one of the three , not true . The license included only works for one amp , the AC box combo and not the other two , you need to purchase the license for them . Plus the instructions for getting the system installed and operational are poor . You can not run the output through your sound card to your PC speakers due to latency . You must use the headphone jack on the interface . In addition if you are in an austere environment and ca n't get to the internet to register your product immediately you are out of luck trying to make it work . Once you overcome all of these obstacles it is a good little product .	1
Nice quality plug . I used this plug to connect my lower row of pedals on my pedal board to the second line of pedals . Works great and no noise ! The shielding on these Planet Waves cables are great .	1
Not sure that title is good grammar , but anyway : I have gotten so much use out of my H2 ! I 'm a music teacher , and I have recorded music classes and performing groups . Being able to so easily record a class and then have them listen to themselves has been really eye ( and ear- ) opening for those kids ! It is very easy to use . The various recording quality settings are useful , so you can do anything from a high quality record to a more space-saving mp3 setting.You can record stereo from just in front of the unit , or you can turn on 4-way , all-around recording.I 've used mine a lot also just recording myself on various instruments . I often record one part of a duet , then play along with it.You can do some editing on the unit , but it 's easier to download the track and use some software to do it . I have gone direct to disk , though , just by cutting off a little noise at beginning or end , which is some of the editing you can do on the H2.There is little to fault with it . It takes a while to rename a track , for instance , but there again you could do it on your desktop after you download.Prior to this I had a Sony minidisc recorder , which was all right but really was already obsolete by the time I bought it . I finally got tired of messing with discs.I am very glad I got the H2 .	1
Quality strings at a very affordable price . They are made from quality materials and care is given with quality control to ensure the buyer of a good product .	1
i love abalone . these picks look really pretty , like seashells and they last pretty well . the thin picks are pretty thin which make them nice for acoustic strumming and whatnot- but i would recommend mediums at least for the electric guitar .	1
On my mixer , I have send/returns on the same plug using a 3 wire TRS with send on the tip , return on the ring , and a common ground . But my effects boxes like to have separate 1/4 '' TR ins and outs.This is the perfect cable for just such a hookup of things like the behringer sharkBehringer Shark FBQ100 Automatic Feedback Destroyerto the 1202-vlZ3 's send/returnsMackie 1202-VLZ3 12-Ch . Compact Recording/SR MixerI probably will order a second cable having seen how well the first one worked out on a send/return .	1
DAddario 's are my go to strings for my Washburn and Ibanez acoustics . They sustain well , great tone , tune well , and last for a good while between changes .	1
Tested this on my Blue Yeti USB Microphone and could tell the difference with the POP filter on right away . Good investment .	1
it 's tri pack with great quality strings on good deal ! i purchased 2 of this set and it works great . it sounds balanced ( warm and bright ) . i prefer change strings often so i ca n't afford to do that with expensive set of strings . this one is affordable and make my guitar sound good ! anyone needs string go for it !	1
Good quality , well made . Its a simple cable , what can be said . It was a good deal , did the job .	1
The ebow is a crazy concept . It 's fun to use and also very challenging . It comes with a book that had many variations on how to use it , which was nice . Comes with a velvet pouch and dvd . It 's a little pricey now I assume from supply and demand but if you 've got the extra cash and play every day , pick this up . Also , I played in a band and we did Miserlou and the other guitar player played the trumpet part with an ebow . I do n't know how he did it or what setting his amp was on , but it sound like there was a TRUMPET in the room . He clearly , was good with an ebow . Goes to show how diverse they are .	1
Without changing my pickups or polishing my frets , I thought I 'd try to get a little more sustain switching up strings . At first I thought I had got a bum buy because the I had to bring the action up a bit to account for the over brightness of the strings . Had my tone all off and I was ready to dig my other set back out of the trash ... .. played on it for a half hour ( went through the exact same thing with the Polywebs I put on the RG655 ) then retuned , sounded pretty good . Played for another half hour and retuned and it actually sounds great now . Dropped the action back down and it 's smooth as silk in an hour 's time . VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND	1
i have purchased 5 of these strap locks . i would recommend them to all . they work good . very solid hold . thanks	1
Do n't let the price and the fact that they are plastic fool you . This is an awesome pedal . Ive had it for a couple of months now and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a metal sound . It is made of a tough plastic and as long as you do n't abuse it to much it should be fine . You can adjust all range of sound and make it yours . As the title states I love the sound and I also love the price . Buy this !	1
Perfect thickness and action.What else can I say ? You wo n't be sorry you got these , they are all I 'll get from now on .	1
In the interest of full disclosure , this is the first guitar strap I have ever owned . That being said , the strap is fairly soft and pliable , with that almost broken in feel . I was expecting it to be a little stiffer , but I 'm glad it is n't . It fit my Ibanez acoustic just fine . My guitar is nothing fancy , so I would presume the `` strap locks '' are pretty standard . The fit is really tight at first , so that should be a good thing . I suppose I could have unscrewed my strap locks to facilitate mounting the strap , but I didn't.The range of fit seems pretty good to me . I am 6 ' tall and wear my acoustic up a little high , kind of `` folk style '' I guess . If I want to , I can adjust it so that it rides lower around my pelvis area . One end is suede on both sides and has the tanned leather-logo patch on it , while the other end is black suede on one side and tan suede on the backside . I ca n't see it marring the guitar at all . It is comfortable around my neck and shoulder . Made in Canada , seems well built and durable . Once again my left shoe is happy to have its lace back , and Keith gets to keep his head fashionable . If you have any questions , feel free to ask and I will answer as best I can . Thanks for reading.SPO	1
There are several types of practice amps . High end modlers ( Line 6 , G Dec , Vox VT ) that can still run $ 400+ and are typically overloaded with features . The low end tubes ( Fender Blues Junior , Bug V22 , Peavey Valveking , etc ) . These typically are more stripped down ( in features , not neccessarily quality ) . And then there are the micros . I always thought they were just a notch above toys , the sort of amps found in a prepackaged guitar set up from Wally World at Christmas.Boy was I wrong ... I needed a portable amp for my son to take to and from practice after school . It was important to me that he could schlepp his own gear . He 's not a big kid , so even 15lb . amps are pushing it ( plus a gig bag and school back pack ) . That was initially what brought me to the Micro . Not sound or features , just the smallest possible amp for my little virtuoso . Turns out this is an AMAZING amp . The tone destroys the Line 6 and the features crush the Vox Pathfinder ( 6watt ? ) or Bug V12 . And the Fender frontman - not even in the ballpark.Each of the models are distinct . The cleans are sparkly ( more trebly ) and the high gain models are very articulate . Obviously this is n't a loud amp , but that 's not all bad . You can get everything this amp has to offer at reasonable volumes . It also can be battery powered ( the life is suprisingly long ) , includes a regular wall plug , headphone jack , built in tuning fork ( which is kind of lame ) and a series of onboard effects that can be run simultaneously . For example , I was able to crank up the delay and tremelo and pull off some Dick Dale surpher licks with suprising accuracy.Do n't let the size fool you . I honestly thought it was nothing more than a toy and I could n't have been more wrong . There are several big websites and it 's tough to find any negatives about this amp . Quality sounding and durable for a great price.Oh - and the red - if you can find it - looks pretty sweet too .	1
High-quality cable for expanding the capability of the One-Spot or Godlyke 9V power adapter . Distance between plugs more than adequate for most pedal boards .	1
the best strings in the world i recently switched to ernie cobalt strings which are more expensive but so much epic !	1
The industry standard for live performance , the SM58 has withstood the test of time and for good reason . These are the only microphones that I perform with , and the on/off switch makes it easier so I do n't have to power down all of my gear when I am done practicing ... I just turn the mic off .	1
This is not just a tuner - its a peacekeeper for our band . Arguing over tuning can really take up time . It works so good everyone in our acoustic string band is required to have one attached ! I do kind of miss the fights over who 's in tune and who 's flat , though . Excellent product , though the metronome is of no value , but that 's not important . We use it for guitars , violins , violas , cello , bass guitar , voice training , and ordering pizza ( who ever is out of tune pays the pizza bill ) .	1
The absolute best guitar stand made . Strong , and durable . I bought one about 4 months ago , and just ordered a second . Hercules is by far the best quality for musical instrument stands .	1
This compact humidifier is easily filled with an included plastic syringe . If you do n't over-fill , it will not drip , and you can simply place it in your case instead of the usual sponge .	1
I was n't expecting much from this case ; I bought it on a deployment to take a guitar back home with me that I had also order off Amazon that was of better quality then I had expected . This case is sweet ! I love the black and crome , it looks great and the inside is well cusioned and really smooth . If you need a case do n't even think twice about , this is a great one at a great price .	1
White thin picks by fender , what else can I say ? They are very good looking , the only downside with thin picks is that you tend to keep buying thin picks because they keep breaking BECAUSE YOU ARE PLAYING FAST AND WILD WITH THEM !	1
Construction and Use : 5/5The connectors and shielding on these cables are good and do not introduce much noise into a system.The manufacturer has done a good job on this cable , but the user is responsible for two things ( this addresses complaints I see in other reviews ) :1 ) Take care of your cables . The right angle plug side is much stronger than the straight plug side ; this is by design . Take good care of your cables and it should last you quite a long time . This includes taking the time to store them for use.2 ) Make sure you know what length you need for a cable . The shorter the cable , the better for studio use . It reduces signal travel time and potential for interference ( though these cables are shielded so the latter concern is moot ) . If you need a longer cable , buy a longer cable . Do n't buy what is advertised as 5 ' cable and then write a negative review when you really needed a 15 ' cable .	1
This strap is perfect ! It locks on your pins , no worry about sudden disconnects and is comfortable ( it 's not padded ) . Highly recommend !	1
I expected this to come with a DC adapter . Nowhere is it mentioned there would n't be any or I could have ordered one . The product is good , surprisingly loud . The bass is too much for the body and the battery cover sort of rattles ( once the battery popped out by itself when I played a low E ) but that 's no issue . I have only used it with a 9V battery so far and noticed a continuous noise on a high gain . I hope that does n't happen with an adapter . It 's a nice little amp , good for carrying around . If you have long fingers , you can sort of hold it between your outstretched thumb and middle finger along it 's height - it 's that small ! A guitar strap , a backpack and a 5ft cable and you could easily walk around the house playing it . The distortion it gives is good . Not good for palm muting . This is nice for practising Randy Rhoads , The Doors -type of rock where not many effects are used.Also remember the DC adapter has a polarity outer ring + and inner - . Many adapters come with the reverse of this polarity so make sure you check that before plugging in one . It 's easy to change the polarity , open the box of the adapter and exchange ( needs soldering , obv ) the red and the black wire places !	1
These are your basic speaker stands for PA systems ... they 're functional , durable , and can be set-up within just a few seconds . I would have given this a higher rating , however upon receipt , one of the stands would not lock into place and kept sliding down regardless of how tight I had set the tension . While inspecting the bag , I found a hard plastic block which looked like it was part of the aluminum tubing of the speaker stand . Further inspection confirmed this as this 'block ' was indeed part of the tube , and after several minutes of wrestling with it , I was able to get it lodged back inside . The block was part of the tension & # 34 ; mechanism & # 34 ; and once it was forced back into the tube , the stand ( s ) performed flawlessly .	1
works right out of the box . Easy to read , easy to use ... ... arrived very fast inexcellent shape ... .just had to put the supplied battery into it	1
I only needed one , I have n't use it , but I 'm sure it 's going to work well . This is going to be use for a piano amp which will help with the sound of the amp when put on top.ffsalsa	1
this stand is small but does the job.and folds up in to a small package.i have one for each guitar	1
Finishing a build for a customer , without these , would have been a real problem . Also used these for the tremolo back cover . Very handy . And no digging the the parts bin for screws .	1
I hate winding strings . I got this to help with that . It does it job very well . You can string your guitar in a fraction of the time . It could be a little tougher but as long you do n't give it hell it will be fine . Great and cheap product !	1
You get a 10 '' speaker and separate drive control volume with this amp ; try to findthose two capabilities in another amp for around $ 90.00 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! This is by far the best practice amp I have found in the past 10 years and I owna butt load of new amps.I have actually upgraded to a Champion 40 , but still use this amp as much as the 40.Do n't even think about it , this is one of the best ( under $ 100.00 ) practice amps , unless you are looking for a gadget filled amp , and in that case you should look elsewhere , as this one is forturning on and going for it and not fiddling around with digital controls until you havejust lost most of your practice time.As an addendum , I would like to add that you should probably not try to replace the speakeras I have read from other reviewers . I have a few of these amps , so just for the heck of it , I put in a Celestion G10 Greenback ( which costs more than the 25R ) and was very disappointed withthe results.This amp is not being carried by a lot of retailers now , but can still be had new for under $ 100.00 if you just do an internet search .	1
I 've used this live since I got it and it works great , no problems . Its made of plastic but that does n't effect anything , its pretty tough . It has two modes , noise reduction which clips the noise and silences it when the note fades out , and mute which lets you mute with the stomp switch . I use the mute mode live to silence my bass in between sets but I have also used the reduction mode when my pickups were noisy . Both modes work great and there is a sensitivity knob to dial in the right clipping . Full on it will clip the notes hard and sometimes register quieter notes as noise and clip them all together , less and its more subtle . Great value and a great tool .	1
This is a good quality Capo . The built is similar to the ones I see at the local music stores that sells between $ 9 - $ 14 . I guess they are all made by the same company and then stamped with a logo by whoever is selling it . This capo does not have any logo or stamp but it works just as good as the more expensive ones.I ordered two of this item on 03/18 . Expected delivery is between April 11 - 18 as the product will be shipped from Hong Kong but I received the product on April 2nd.I used it in Acoustic Guitar and on the Ukelele without any problem .	1
In the immortal words that John Cameron Swayze used when hawking his Timex watches during the early days of live television , the Shure SM58 Vocal mic fits perfectly into that same category.Before I found a career as a film and television sound recordist and mixer , I played in rock bands and did live sound mixing . One of the very first mics we truly fell in love with was the SM58 . Introduced by the Shure Brothers Company in 1966 , the SM58 quickly rose to become the industry standard in rugged road mics that actually sound good to the ear and are nearly indestructible.The mic capsule is of cardiord ( heart shaped ) design which helps reject sound from either side . There is a 4K bump in it 's frequency which helps vocals cut through stage noise . Construction is rugged , frequency response is 50 to 15,000 Hz , and the capsule sits internally on a foam shock mount to help isolate it from handling noise.We used to joke about the SM58 in that if you needed a hammer and you could n't find one , just grab one of these , they are that tough . I 've seen some of these on the road that you could n't believe still worked , but they did and sounded great.The cage style pop screen gives the SM58 not only it 's distinctive look , one that influenced many other mic brands from the day it was introduced , but it 's part of the functionality . Internally lined with a layer of acoustic foam , the cage helps keep vocals pops from getting to the dynamic mic element . As a frame of reference , theShure SM57LC Shure SM57 Cardioid Dynamic Microphoneis the same exact mic and capsule , but without the pop screen.Shure also sells a Performer series mic , theShure Beta 58A Supercardioid Dynamic Microphonethat looks almost identical to the SM58 but uses a totally different mic capsule and transformer and has a different sound so try before you buy.The Shure SM58 is still considered the industry standard of live performance mics today and for the price , they really are a good deal .	1
What does anyone really want to know about a string winder . Yes it will help you string your instrument quicker . And Yes , it 's still in one piece . I would buy it again . You may even buy 2 because the same gnomes that steal pick 's and capo 's take these too .	1
Strong and wo n't tip.price is very affordable.I own several and have had no trouble with them.Buy it and you will see .	1
In the case of you change the guitar strings , or in case you just make a revision setup , this item is very useful , because the guitar will be land and the her body will stay firmly attached .	1
wow ... so pleased with this $ 12 microphone , packs less of a punch than the Shure SM 58 but works great , very happy so far , used it to microphone some percussion and it worked great , could not really tell the difference from the real thing . If it breaks ... so what ... it costs 12 bucks , great microphone for someone on a tight budget . Highly recommended .	1
I bought this for my Takamine EGSF15SC acoustic/electric guitar and it fits snugly and does the job very well.I am very happy with the low price I got , and am very pleased with the overall quality of this case.It has exceeded my expectations .	1
Awesome tuner ! spot on tuning , very bright display and super fast and easy to use ! this is a must have	1
Amazing strings , they last longer feel better on the bends than any other . They have a smoother feel and a nice bright sound .	1
This is not top of the line but for the price is a good deal . I do n't think it lastforever but it works great for my Peavey Patriot Guitar . I would recommend this toanyone looking for an inexpensive way to transport a guitar .	1
Dava 6024 Grip TipItem is as advertised . This is my first attempt at playing the mandolin for which I selected this product . They work just fine for a starter . I may learn different as time goes along , assuming that you can teach an old dog new tricks as the saying goes .	1
I used to use Fender medium picks only . Now for Jazz and metal I use this pick . You will just have to try it for yourself to see if it is right for you .	1
Easy to install , I used the guitars existing strap button screws.Straplocks came with black & white felt , that 's a nice touch . I think black looks better with my guitar .	1
I bought a pair of these cables and they work just fine . There does n't seem to be any noise and they seem to be built to last . They do what they 're supposed to do .	1
Dirt box gold for under 50 bucks ! Highly adjustable tone , volume and distortion level that wo n't tank your amplifier tone , while letting you get between everything from back alley blues to blistering metal . I love this pedal ! ! ! The true bypass is a bonus if you are in love with your amp 's tone , but lose it when you engage your pedal . Not anymore . I know there are some great distortion pedals on the market , but you wo n't find this quality and tone at a better price . Joyo win.Sorry OS-2 - it 's pawnshop time for you !	1
This is a well assembled and packaged unit , designed to a price . So certain compromises have been necessary.Compromises such as a single-supply wall wart - partly an advantage to get the AC out of the amplifier itself - and very basic circuit , with inexpensive parts . The preamp supports only moving magnet cartridges , and has no provision for load adjustments or the like.On the other hand it works well , is packaged nicely , and serves its purpose for folks who are not audiophiles or fussy , but want a basic phono/RIAA amp for their turntable to connect to line inputs . Also , by avoiding the & ldquo ; all-in-one & rdquo ; tendency of units that include inexpensive D/A converters and such for USB output , this is almost certainly cleaner for the analog-only uses for which it is suited.The unit is also very & ldquo ; hackable & rdquo ; if you 'd like to upgrade things like capacitors , resistors , or the opamps . Or use a nicer external power supply - the first thing I 'd upgrade . Lastly , if you know the ideal capacitive load for your cartridge , and the capacitance of your phono cables , you can adjust the loading on the inputs accordingly.Recommended if your budget is limited .	1
I love these little guitar stands . They are small enough to go anywhere with you , and they are cheap enough that you can keep a couple of them around . Which is good if you are as clumsy as I am.The last two of these that I have owned met untimely deaths . The first was on stage and since it is so small I tripped over it on the back of the stage . The second one I tripped over and ended up falling off of the stage . I know , I know ... but they really are cool little stands , and I just bought another one lol . I am a glutton for punishment !	1
All the parts I buy an Amazon have been checks out before I buy them and they have been compared with other companies , and I found these parts are the best price and quality compared to other outlets I repair and rebuild guitars as a hobby and I am satisfied with these parts johnJ .	1
I got this in the mail a week ago and have played with it constantly.there is so much in this little box ! i was just interested in the drum tracks in it when i bought it but i have since stopped using all of my other effects and just used this ! i highly recomend this to anyone who plays an electric guitar .	1
I have the original version of this capo and it works just fine as does this one . However , it seems theu have made a slight modification which increases its value from my viewpoint . Yhey have added a channel on the capo onto which slides a bracket which is included . This bracket holds the NS micro tuner , of which I have 3 . I had considered anther capo which came with a tuner for certain applications . However , now , this ingenious little bracket enables me to use a tuner in tandem or not depending on my need . A simple modification , but bordering on genius . The capo itdelf id wuite capable as it is a spring attached capo with a micro adjustment screw/spring which can be helpful with guitars that go sharp when a capo is employed . Highly recommended .	1
Purchased this after owning a ernie ball polish cloth that was given to me . This cloth cleans up pretty well , but what i noticed after wiping down the strings a few times is that the fibers would hook . I dunno if they were n't meant to wipe the strings with but my ernie ball cloth is A LOT more durable than this cloth . They do the job but i believe that the ernie ball cloth does it better . Like a previous reviewer , i 'm a little iffy about putting this cloth in the washer.Update : Putting it in the watcher was fine and idk why but after washing it for the first time it cleans up 1000000x better than before , i like this and my ernie ball cloth : ) From 3 to 5 starts ! !	1
I have been through a few delay pedals trying to get the sound I want.1 ) Boss digital delay : I really did n't like the sound of the delay overall . No real positives to mention2 ) Carbon copy analog delay : Worked great for cleans . But totally muddied up my lead distortion tone ( even though it was in my fx loop ) . I could n't get the repeats to duck under the main signal3 ) Nova Delay : I really wanted to like this . Presets , tap tempo and a nice feature set . But the sound just lacked warmth . It was very digital soundingAt this point I was n't sure what I wanted . Analog delays were warm sounding but too mushy . Digital delays were clear sounding but.. just too digital and uninspiring ! I was debating springing an insane amount of money on the strymon timeline , when I found this pedal . Analog dry signal thru with digital delay ! ! This is what the magic sauce is in my opinion . Now my signal has the nice separation of the digital delay and my underlying tone is preserved . Set it to the 2290 type delay and its perfect . Sure , it does n't have the presets and what not but for a good sounding delay , this ca n't be beat at this price range.Sure enough , when I checked the strymon timeline specs , I found out that it too has the analog dry through with digital delay . Just that its delays may be modeled better and it has a rich feature set . But $ 450+ for a delay pedal is just too much for me.Buy this if you are chasing tone , you wo n't be disappointed . Skip if looking for presets , tap tempo etc .	1
It was great to get quality Christmas gifts that my son was pleased with . The budding musician in our home was glad to receive this item as we do not have a music store in our town . So thanks to Amazon for making this possible .	1
No on/off switch is a bummer , but it works ! Solid construction , decent sound , comes with a cable for convenience.UPDATE After playing in a small shed for a while , the bass player was complaining of some crazy rattling when he played a B note . We messed with the PA and all the electronics . What it came down to , was my mic ( Pyle-Pro PDMIC58 Professional Moving Coil Dynamic Handheld Microphone ) placement . I switched mics and kept them in the exact same position , and the rattle went away . Whats all this mean ? The quality of this mic is just ok . If you 've got a lot of sound going on , maybe get a better one .	1
Needed a mixer and figured it was worth the risk to try this inexpensive mixer . It is limited in what it can do but it does the job . I 'm rapidly becoming a behringer fan . The three points mentioned in another rating ( Inputs should be out the back , needs rubber feet , and the led ) are spot on . I 'd also like to see another set of outputs on it as well . It could also use being a tad bigger , they jammed everything into such a small area the knobs are a little close together . The LED for the power on this thing is so bright it 's obnoxious , it almost blinds you . Other than that its a great and affordable little mixer that does everything they advertise ...	1
This stand easily folds , and holds my Mandolin in a scratch-proof stance . Not good for smaller instruments , like the name may imply to some . An attempt to hold a smaller ukulele miserably failed , but everything from Tenor uke and up , did just fine ! : )	1
First off this is a overdrive pedal with a MOSFET circuit engineered to sound like overdriven tube distortion . The pedal is very good at this . There are a lot of tones available but fully cranked through a large amp , this is on par with the warm tone of another EHX pedal , the Big Muff Fuzz . The tone function is kindof useless to me I like to keep it on , With the switch turned on the effect is a little too harsh . Do n't let that keep you from checking this hot rod out . I love mine . Its a keeper .	1
I 'm glad I tried these , I wont order them again . I thought they might be a good alternate for my Dunlop nylon picks , not really though.Edit : Im nothing if not fair . My last review of these was in the context of my playing my Strat or sometimes my 335 . I stand by that review . However , now Im playing my Godin 5th Ave and suddenly these picks are perfect . Ive gone back and forth trying different picks with my guitars . In the end these are the picks I reach for when Im playing the Godin.I will buy these again . I changing my review from 'Just Okay ' to `` Contextually Perfect '' . Ok I 'll add a star , your right I should add a star . There !	1
USB Condenser mics and more specifically this one are great for doing Podcasts and for portability . The reason being is that they are condensers for one , and the other is that this mic has a built in interface . An interface is a glorified sound card with both a microphone preamp and ( Analogue to digital , and digital to analogue ) AD/DA converters . Of course most any standalone interface is going to give you way more desirable results than just plugging a microphone into the mic jack on your computer ; way , way better . So this MXL Studio 24 USB even with the built in interface is going to give you quality far exceeding your computers potential . So instead of having to carry a separate interface around with you having this all in one MXL Studio 24 USB all you need is a laptop with a USB input and you.There are limitations though with a USB mic with the main one being that you can only record the microphone without being able to plug in any instruments . ( Although you could record instruments using this microphone and that way be able to layer more tracks in your DAW . ) Recording multiple tracks at the same time is not possible with this mic unless you are recording the same thing in multiple tracks.The really good thing about this mic is that you are getting some pretty decent quality for the money . So for anything that you need to do using a microphone as your one and only sound device it is ideal , quick , easy , and affordable.One of the problems with using it in Pro Tools , or any DAW is that you can only use one interface at a time . Since the mic has a built in interface you ca n't use any other . Even in Garage Band for MAC , although they have the ability to use more than one interface because you can toggle between the two but not be able to use two simultaneously . So in plain words if you are planning studio capabilities a USB mic is not what you need . I have a couple of MXL condenser mics that I bought for my studio . I have the MXL V57M which was their early offering but is no longer made and I have found the MXL V250 to be comparable to that one . Some other MXL 's like the 990 are muddy in the bottom end . When bottom fishing for a good/decent condenser mic some of the CAD offerings are also top sellers.When using the MXL 24 USB in Win 7 no driver download is necessary . If your mic comes without the included CD you can download the free MXL Studio Control app which includes input controls for microphone gain and an adjustable high pass filter . It also has a nose gate with adjustable threshold . There are also output adjustments as well.One other thing that is unique about USB mics working with your PC is that they are dependent of course on your PC . So I had the hardest time trying to figure out what was wrong when I could n't get the output from my PC or into the free Reaper DAW recording software ( free 60 day trial ) also downloadable from MXL . So I finally gave up after trying various input options etc and discovered through the troubleshooter in Windows 7 accessible via Control panel , and then `` Sound '' and then type `` Troubleshooter '' into the search box in the upper right corner . The answer was that my mic input volume inside of Windows was down to zero . I moved the slider up and bang it worked.So for sound quality you are getting decent quality for the price and it has a built in interface and even an output jack you can plug your headphones into ; it 's a mini jack like you have on your computer . So with just your laptop and this mic you are set for pod-casting , or any other function that requires only one microphone and no other channels . This mic comes with a desktop stand which is an indication of its intended purpose as opposed to a studio vocal or instrument mic .	1
Great addition to a guitar pickers bag of tricks . It does hold plenty of picks for a gig or practice . It does not take up much room & it sure feels good to have extra picks close by so that you do not have to scramble to find another one .	1
These are great . I have these on all my guitars . Only problem is the clip on install to the strap . If you ca n't get it done google for install videos which will show you how to use a pliers to push the clip into place . Once installed you are good for life .	1
I use this often to record my band 's gigs . Now if they would make one that will hold a PAR 38 can so I can turn my extra mic stands into single can lighting racks !	1
I rated it at 5 stars because 5 stars means & # 34 ; I Love it & # 34 ; in Amazon 's selection of things . I do love it . In fact I think it is better than my Sans Amp Bass DI which costs more . Do n't get me wrong , the Sans Amp is still great . I just find this easier to dial in , it is durable and seems a bit more lively sounding than the previously mentioned preamp . The only down side is that it does n't come with an AC power adapter . That is n't a problem for me since I have many power options on my pedal boards . This takes the standard negative polarity center like Boss pedals.If you have been playing bass for a while , you know that no matter how good your bass rig is , you can make it better by putting a decent tone shaping booster in front of your amp ... that being said ... ... ... ... I am in my 50s and I play mostly guitar hero music like Robin Trower , SRV , Hendrix , Yes , Rush , and lots of blues and southern rock etc etc ... ... ... ... . the fun old rock n roll stuff.Like the Sans Amp , putting this in front of any bass amp only makes the bass sound better . You can easily get the live Chris Squier or Geddy Lee sound . The older style full deep bass bluesy rock sound is simple . The tone that I love to dial in is that old 3 piece rock band sound from years past . Think of Mel from Grand Funk Railroad or old James Gang in the Joe Walsh Days , Johnny winter , and the Cream ... ... .. that over driven cranked Ampeg or Fender tube bass amp sound that filled in exceptionally well in a 3 piece power band.I am running this into an Ampeg Bass combo and I have run it directly to the front of house sound system and the sound is fabulous . Playing bass is a side gig for me since I am mainly a lead guitarist ... ... .. I let my bassist try it ( he also uses a Sans Amp Bass DI at our gigs ) and he immediately went online and purchased one.He is another cool use for this pedal . If you are a guitarist , put it in front of your guitar amp . The punch and power that you add to your sound is incredible . Try it .	1
This is great for keeping your pedal board more organized . All you need is a power conditioner and you are ready to plug in .	1
I 've used this for about 3 months now . No malfunctions . Looks good . Works fine . No complaints . What more can I say ?	1
The Danelectro FAB series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget . The D-6 Fab Flange effects pedal works great and gives me that wobble phase shift you would only expect from a more expensive unit ... This series of pedals ( FAB ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well . Danelectro offers more expensive units but I do n't think the sound is much better , just the hardware is better , but that 's my view ! ! ! . You ca n't go wrong with this product , Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product ... I have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great ...	1
They work no issues handy to have on hand . Dont know what else to say they are screws they fasten thongs in place	1
I got this amp recently , at a local store , and so far im loving it , i also aqcuired the MKII Foot Controller and is a perfect combination . Tons of sounds and it can be 100 % edited to fit your demands . Nice volume coming out of it also , for 75 watts it seems more.Recommended	1
With the exception of the MC-1 classical , Fender has upped the quality of every low-end guitar it 's associated with . The latest & # 34 ; bargain basement & # 34 ; Squier Strat Bullet is no exception . As other reviewers have indicated , a Squier Bullet ... straight from the box ... is ready to give guitars several times its street value full-on competition . But why stop there ? If you 've read some of my other reviews , you know I 'm a serial hot-rodder . And THIS is my favorite 'victim ' . Why ? Because it 's such a sound platform to begin with ( pun intended ) .The basic stuff on the Bullet is very good ... and for many , it 's all that 's required . But let 's quest after some serious , big-league sound . The first things to upgrade are the pickups . The standard ceramic-magnet Squier pickups do yeoman 's work , but they 're wonderfully eclipsed by top-drawer pickups from Lace and Seymour Duncan . My favorites ? A Lace Red Dually bridge with a single Lace Hot Gold parked half-way between the middle and neck positions . The Lace Hot Gold value pack with a Hot Gold Hot bridge pickup . And the Lace 'patriot ' Red , Silver , and Blue value pack . You simply have to hear the difference these pickups make to believe it ... and all you need to find out is a Phillips screwdriver , a cheap soldering iron , some low-temperature solder , a pair of wire-cutters , option YouTube 'how-to ' videos , and some patience.But wait a minute , hold the phone ... what about the stock pick guard ? Please memorize this : Chandler Guitar 's Pickguard Heaven . Better yet , Google it . They 're wonderful folks and they do excellently-affordable work . With a custom pick guard , virtually ANYTHING is possible ( e.g . how about a Seymour Duncan Dimebucker bridge ? ) ! The next thing to do is to block the tremolo ( whammy ) mechanism . Proper vibrato comes from the fingers . Period . A small piece of oak from Home Depot , carefully whittled ( not for the guitar 's sake , but for your finger 's ) can be easily wedged between the guitar body and the die-cast tremolo string-carrier by removing ( and eventually replacing ) six Phillips screws on the back of your Strat . Hey , now you 're Eric Clapton.If you want bold-as-brass sound , the stock plastic nut can be replaced with a brass Strat nut , a bit of careful filing , and a tiny touch of epoxy or Gorilla glue . Why bother ? A more forward lead guitar sound . If you play rhythm , do n't bother.Finally , if you 're a monster about precise tuning and have basic woodworking skills , the very good stock tuners can be replaced with state-of-the-art six-inline tuners from several manufacturers . Note well : most folks will be more than well served by the stock tuners.So what 's then point of all this ? For the price of one genuine American Strat ( which is a VERY nice ride if you can afford it ) you can have three or four , arguably-equally-excellent Squier Bullets with a diverse mix of pickups and resulting sounds .	1
this tuner works great . it is easy to see and accurate for basic guitar tuning . I use mine all the time between different alternative tunings . I liked it so much , I bought one for my grandson who is learning to play guitar as well . a great investment unless you have a perfect ear .	1
This pedal is remarkable for useful tones . The sound may not be for everyone , but i already have a Boogie for the really metal like distortion . I needed something that was different but still usable , and I feel this pedal fills the bill . The low price tag did n't hurt my feelings either . This is a win-win buying decision as far as I am concerned .	1
As some of the other reviews state , you barely need any type of guitar cleaner when using these microfiber cloths . I 've found for the best results , use a wax sealant product , and then use this cloth separately and afterward to clean your guitar . The fingerprints and smudges lift off effortlessly .	1
Came with more screws than i needed . They were the right size . No issues . Thanks . You shouldnt be disappointed with this item .	1
I am still considering myself a beginner with the guitar . I have learned a few songs , but I still am not that good enough to spend a huge amount of money on a guitar . I wanted something that would sound nice and still be relatively cheap . I had the Dean Electric Guitars in the past and a Fender Acoustic a while ago . The Fender and the Dean 's were very nice . I thought the Dean 's had a very nice sound to them and so did the Fender . This guitar has a very nice sound to it as well . I could n't figure out the different tunings on it though . It said Rhythm and Treble and then just regular in the middle . I kept it on the regular because it sounded normal . The other one 's must be for some special type of music . But this guitar sounded just as good if not better than the Dean 's . It is also very easy to hold unlike the Dean 's I have found . The Dean 's also had warped necks which made some notes not playable and I have not found one on this guitar which is a plus . But this is a very nice beginner 's guitar if your just looking to get started . I would stay away from those Fender knockoff 's and stuff like that and get this guitar . I also got the cheap Rogue amp to use with it and it sounds great , plenty loud enough if not too loud sometimes . All in all , a very nice bargain .	1
I have played guitar for most of 40 years and have used about any type of plectrum made . I have used coins and washers at times.My favorite pick for years was a Fender heavy and then I went for the really heavy brands like Dunlop or Clayton but found they are way too heavy and were eating my tone . I went back to Fenders and then found I like the medium best.Fender makes these in the coolest colors now so I went with them . Price them at a store and you will come back here.These came from GO-DPS which is no big deal as I shop on AMZ enough to know they use secondary sellers a lot of the time.However , I ordered a lot of stuff the day I ordered these and the full exhaust system was in my house 5 days later . These did n't show up so I contacted AMZ which goes back to GO-DPS . it took nearly a month to receive an envelope containing 12 picks . It did n't kill me not to have them - I have a million picks , I just wanted to see these in my hand.That said , I will definitely buy these again in the future and go for the different colors.Great price , great picks .	1
I have had this stand for over 2 years and still like it 's compact transport capability . Since I purchased mine , several other musicians have purchased the same stand . It is well built , and can handle heavy music binders without tipping . I 've used it at both inside and outside gigs without any problems .	1
This is far more pedal than I need but what a fun pedal to have . Just going through the presets was fun , but downloading and trying the stuff they have available online was even funner : ) The bad part about this pedal is that it is HUGE and will take up a lot of space on your board . You have to be committed to dealy . You 'll have 3 different presets available at one time from the footswitches . I ca n't comment on the looper as I never used it .	1
I never really considered a cheaper cable , I was always taught to get the best I could afford . When this showed up in a cable search on amazon , I jumped on it . I figured I had nothing to lose.To my surprise , this is an excellent cable , with good build quality and a strong , thick jacket that inspires confidence . The sound through it is identical to my Monster cables , and it cost one quarter the price ... .hmmmm , guess I should have tried to figure this out myself instead of listening to & # 34 ; snobs & # 34 ; for so many years . I will never do that again.This is worth the money twice over , try it out for yourself and kiss overpriced cables goodbye !	1
This is another useful item from Planet Waves for the guitar player . This winder saves time , especially when you are anxious to get back to playing after breaking a string or replacing every string.This is not bulky & fits into several different guitar cases without taking up much room . Worth the price .	1
They add depth to your bass drum by muffling the overtones a bit , and it is the pads that wear out rather than your bass drum head so these actually save you money and sound better . I 've used a couple different brands , and they pretty much are similar .	1
This pedal is amazing . It has so many functions . Unless your a caveman there is no need to worry about it being plastic . I love this pedal and I would completely recommend it .	1
The mic is well made ( heavy on the & # 34 ; mic & # 34 ; end ) , but I have yet to try it with my pop filter and multi-track studio .	1
Although it is touted for acoustic guitars , it works well with my Ibanez Electric as well as my dreadnaught and acoustic/electric . The spring is tough and it holds securely . On and off is a quick process if you have the hand/finger strength to operate it . I rate it 4 stars only because I just received it and have n't had a chance to use it much . But , I like it so far . It was delivered quickly . It does the job . I 'll update after I 've had it for awhile .	1
I put this puppy on in 15 minutes or less . They fit perfect on my American Standard Stratocaster . They work like a charm . If you play guitar and like to keep your strings in tune on your strat . This are a no brainier , the price is right , and they look great on your stratocaster .	1
I put a pair of these on every guitar that I own . I have a lot of extra strap clips around since I have many more guitars than straps , but these are great ; they are all plenty tough , and if I find myself with my Straplok 'd strap , it 's nice that these work fine with a normal strap in a pinch .	1
The best part of this pick is that it is easier on my strings , it still gives the pick tone , but seems to do less damage .	1
I installed these on my 2000-ish Epiphone Les Paul . They provide a VERY noticeable upgrade and provide a true vintage look . I can tune with much finer precision , and they hold that tuning with even the nastiest of bending . The ability to accurately tune and keep that tuning allows to play and sound better . I should note that I had to drill new holes or , more precisely , enlarge the holes on my guitar . I used a 3/8 drill bit and just went very slowly and carefully . I 'm sure the idea of drilling your guitar might sound scary , but it was actually quite easy . Now they are in there nice and snug since I made the holes a bit tight .	1
I 've used the classic Kyser capos for years with my acoustic guitars . They definitely look great , but they tend to lose their tension and allow for string buzz after a year or so . That 's my experience at least . These trigger capos may look and feel awkward to a lot of people , but they are wonderful . I get a perfect barr at every fret and it feels like this will never wear out . I 've had one for a couple years now and the only problem I find with them is that your friends tend to take them for themselves and it 's easiest just to buy a new one . Highly recommended for acoustic guitar players !	1
I have K & K pickups in other guitars . This is the first one I 've bought that had the smaller transducers . It needs a preamp unlike the now discontinued Pure Western with the larger transducers . Like other K & K pickups it sounds darned good . With a decent PA head and good speakers you can get a very natural sound with hardly any tweaking . The pickup is easy to install if you can ream out the end pin hole to accommodate the strap jack . This one comes with an ingenious DIY installation jig made from , I 'm not kidding , cardboard , golf tees , and double sided tape . It makes placement a snap . The best pickup is still an external mic , but for noisy situations where feedback is a problem these pickups are the answer . You can induce feedback but you can go to an adequate level for most situations . They sound much more natural than a magnetic or under saddle pickup .	1
I love this thing and for the price you just ca n't beat it . It seems sturdy and I have gigged with it for a couple months now and it is holding up . I have n't tried it with acoustic guitars but it fits my 7 electric guitars very nicely . Set up only took about 10 min or so and it included all the tools necessary . I saw the same one in guitar center a week later for $ 60 more . Like I said , for the price you ca n't beat it .	1
If you are looking for a compact size pickup this is it . I 've tried it on my fiddle and a mountain dulcimer . It is great for a quick way to get electrified . Lead wire is not very substantial , but if it breaks in the future hopefully I can just buy another one . To get the best sound you should probably run this unit thru a preamp .	1
to much string for my beginner fingers but seemed to be the real brand and a decent price.i would reorder in 9 's or maybe even 10 's next time	1
Got three of these straps as we got tired of changing them whenever we needed one on a different guitar . This is a great strap for the money . They leather ends do not rub the guitar finish and the holes do not wear out as fast . If you want to spend more money , you can and get a little better ( leather extends higher on the strap on the more expensive ones -- nicer ) but if you want something that is functional and looks good this is a good value .	1
There are a ton of phaser options out there - even from MXR themselves - which makes this issue a bit confusing . I 'd owned a Phase 90 back in the 80s and wanted another one . A few years ago I did n't have the budget to consider the more expensive MXR versions , so I just got this one.I think it sounds fine . I gigged with it for years without issue . Yes , there 's a slight volume bump , but I think this is really mostly a midrange hump that will alter your tone and give you some distortion , depending on how your amp is set up . I always use it with a clean tone , and I 'm used to it so it 's not a big deal.If I were to shop for a phaser today I 'd consider some of the other MXR models , as well as versions from other manufacturers which offer a mix knob . A phaser is a very specific sound , but I love it in small doses . For my needs this one works .	1
Every guitarist needs a volume pedal at some point in a gig . THe Behringer Preamplifier/Volume booster pedal is an inexpensive yet quality volume pedal that works great !	1
The e-bow is a great tool for any musician looking to get a really neatethereal sound out of their guitar . Great tool !	1
Strap was a much better quality than expected for the cost . Clean well packaged . Has adjustment for length the hole size is per very good will take some working to get it on the guitar so you need not worry about slipping off . I will still use a strap lock . Nice product I suggest it .	1
Comes with a capacitor , so that 's a bonus . These pots are CTS and have a nice tight feel compared to Alpha pots . Alpha are a little cheaper , have basically the same tolerance , are slightly looser in feel as you turn , and get the job done pretty much the same . What it really boils down to is whether you prefer a slightly tighter feel , or a slightly looser turning knob .	1
This strap is comfortable , has plenty of room to expand it to fit , and is just wide enough to continue to be comfy around you . Perfect for uke or mandolin or banjolele , and even the extra thin travel ukes . I really like it !	1
As a lot of Epiphone owners have learned , cases designed for the Gibson ES-335 clones wo n't fit Epiphone guitars , as the Epiphones have a slightly larger headstock . This case , however , fits my Dot Custom like a glove . The padding is perfect , the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar , and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level .	1
These DAddario EXL110 strings are light , responsive and make my Gibson guitar sound great . They work great . Why use anything else ?	1
All these harmonicas in one case and they sound great . You have to get use to the plastic but it is very easy to do and once you do get ready to play away . Nice tone and fun .	1
The Squier Bullet that I have is actually the model without the tremolo , however , everything else is just about the same as the model you see above . It 's a nice guitar for the money . Nice size , action , and finish . It 's not a high-end guitar so do n't expect it to sound like one , but for a beginner , it 's pretty sweet . I bought a more expensive blues guitar and had planned on trading this one in or selling it , however , I like it so much , that I plan on keeping it as a back up . Parts are pretty easy to come by ( with slight modifications , but that 's to be expected ) and fairly cheap too .	1
The stand is very well constructed and very stable . The other stands that I have used were all bottom holders . I was a little concern using a stand with a neck holder , but then again..all guitar stores display their guitars with them ... so I thought ... lets have a go , I 'm glad I did . My stand does n't tip over like the others . You just have to lift up before you take your instrument out . The fingers in front hold the instrument in ... lifting up slightly will disengage the fingers so you can remove your instrument .	1
Good : Plenty of gain on hand . Lots of sustain ! This thing can get really loud . It gives yourinexpensive tube amp that Marshall crunch.Built well , it 's casing is made out of metal , not plastic.Inexpensive but performs and sounds just as well asboutique boxes costing 3 times as much . If you 're lookingfor your first cheap distortion pedal , forget the Boss DS-1 andget this one ! Well worth the money.Bad : Adds a little noise & hiss specially to single coils ( strats & teles ) .You might need to use a noise gate to tame the noise.Quieter with humbuckers but hums when I use it with my Xotic EP Booster whichI always keep on . It does n't happen when I boost my overdrives ( OCD & Hardwire CM-2 ) .If you move farther away from your amp , the hum disappears butyou can still hear some noise . I guess this is typical for distortion boxes.No need to boost it though , it already has that thick & big sound to start with.It did n't come with a 9V battery as shipped , not a big deal 'cause I use a poweradapter anyway .	1
I replaced the nasty , crooked , chipping plastic pins for these , and they work very well in keeping the strings where they should be . I 'm not convinced that they change the sound of my D-28 very much for better or worse . I replaced one pin at a time and compared strings and really could n't tell much of a difference , still they are better to handle and remove than the nasty plastic ones , so I consider them an upgrade .	1
I have a pretty weird pedalboard set-up involving an EHX digital Memory Man looped back into itself and another split earlier in the pedal chain . This does a great job of summing three outputs back into one signal before I go into a reverb pedal and then out to my amp . Takes a little while to dial in exactly where the knobs should be , and they get very loud at the top end , but I have noticed no issues with sound with each knob at around 4.5/10 . I tested to see if I could tell any difference in noise due to this pedal but found none .	1
I use this on my Takamine and my Tele . It is easy to use , applies the right amount of tension and looks very cool . You can leave it clipped on the headstock when not using it . Cheaper ones will work , but I wanted to try it out . I do like it	1
I usually play classical ( nylon string ) guitar , but have an Ovation deep-bowl acoustic electric as well and after the original strings wore out , I never have found strings that I really liked ( do n't ask me why I never thought about contacting Ovation and asking them what they use from the factory . One of those duh things I did n't even think of until just now ) .Based on reviews and questions answered here on Amazon , I purchased this triple-set of strings . Instant gratification . First , they tuned up quickly and retained their tune on a relatively respectable basis ( no new string holds tune perfectly for the first couple of days , but these retained tune fairly well ) . The sound is excellent , the playability comfy . The tone of my Ovation was back.Here are my itemized observations : * First , three sets for $ 13 ( currently ) . Can not beat the value for price . * BRILLIANCE . What many people call & # 34 ; bright & # 34 ; , brilliance is the opposite of & # 34 ; dull & # 34 ; . Some strings sound dull right out of the package . These strings are brilliant , bringing out the full tone and maximum volume from the guitar . * TONE . The natural tone of the guitar is allowed to shine through , no hint of & # 34 ; tinniness & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; plunk & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; twang & # 34 ; . * MELLOW . Mellow is difficult to define , but the best definition I 've heard is , & # 34 ; Ah , that sounds nice. & # 34 ; Mellow is a string settling into a guitar and becoming part of the guitar . It 's a pleasantness that does n't grate on your ears when you pluck a string . These strings are medium-mellow , just enough to allow one to enjoy the sound without falling asleep . : ) * BALANCE . At first the E overtoned the b and e. But as the strings settled that became less pronounced and the strings balanced right out . The trebles became clearly audible while the E and A provided just the right touch of bass . * COMFORT . The 12-53mm diameter of these strings is comfortable to the fingers . Thicker strings are often more difficult to play and can even damage some guitars . Lighter gauge tends to cut into the fingers unless the guitar has excellent action . These strings are just right -- especially the 53mm E , which provides the proper amount of bass without overkill or difficulty in strumming.SUMMARY : These are excellent strings , which does n't surprise me since I 've use D'Addario classical guitar strings for years . Martin and GHS are both good strings , but somehow D'Addario just shines.Thanks to Amazon enthusiasts who helped me decide to give these a try . Highly recommended .	1
I have n't really used this guitar stand because I have been keeping my acoustic guitar in the case so I can keep the humidity nice adding water to a sponge I cut and placed into a plastic bag that I poked tiny holes in with a small nail . The stand works as advertised .	1
My kids are all interested in learning the Uke . This one really appealed to my son because of the front design . Plays well and keeps in tune .	1
I am impressed with d'addario 's electric strings . Easy to adjust to , very light on my fingers and they 're built to last . With a few adjustments to my amp settings , these strings are very dynamic in their tone quality from classic to hard rock styles . Any guitarist who plays electric can enjoy these strings , and they last a long time too .	1
Not much to say here but is really nice to have around . Hold my picks tight and has them where i need them	1
I 'm rating it 4 stars because although it is able to attach to most mic stands , it does n't fit them all very well . Opening up for headliners , you basically get given most of your stage gear ( minus your own instrument gear ) so if you 're given a mic stand that has a smaller diameter tube , this will not fit as nicely . I was playing a couple shows and this thing would slowly slip down the pole ( that 's what she said ) . Usually worked fine . I 'll still recommend this wedgie .	1
serves its purpose ; worked better when I added a quick-disconnect attachment ; quality finish , comfortable , and enough range to adjust as needed ;	1
There are other rack screws out there , but Raxxess makes the best quality screws and soft washers available .	1
It 's a working violin . My daughter likes it . Her violin teacher suggests to up grade the strings and a new Artino Magic Pad . The shoulder rest is way too high for my daughter , but I do n't count that as a defect : - )	1
Works for a cheap bridge on my cheap Stratocaster knock-off . Needed one that was better than the bridge that came with it , and this was a cheap , but not cheaply built option .	1
These strings sound amazing . They also last for a really long time and keep sounding amazing . I get better harmonics with these strings as well .	1
True meaning of the US Dream ... it is hard with a soft overtone giving a sense of calm and well being ... wow yes that is it . no more to be written joy o the american dream .	1
Probably the best single thing this cable has going for it is the Lifetime Warranty.I have owned Planet Waves cables in the past and twice I have sent them back for replacement ... no problems whatsoever.For the price you are paying ( about $ 1 dollar per foot ) you get good quality cable , good cores and shielding with heavy duty retention at the jack connector ends.Not the best , but not the worst . Good enough for live stage gigging and probably wo n't notice much difference if you are recording.I have n't noticed any RF hum or noise when moving about with these cables.They also come with a set of colored bands so you can easily identify which cable goes to where , cable owner , etc.Affordable price and lifetime warranty make this a `` feel good '' purchase.I would recommend these cables and will buy again .	1
**So after reading a couple comments on this review it 's obvious that my original review was somewhat irrelevant being that I was using the strap for the wrong application . According to the first comment and verified from their companies website ( which I should have done before buying ) the strap is meant for a bass guitar . Please do n't purchase this thinking it will work for a standard acoustic or probably even an acoustic bass . Amazon should have clarified in their item description . Thanks for the comments educating me and sorry for the misleading review . **I 'm not a very tall person and this strap is just incredibly short . I currently own two other leather straps and they have the potential to be lengthened so that my acoustic would hang down by my waist or so , even though I usually play it about midway on my torso . I do n't NEED my straps to be super long but this thing makes it hard to even put the guitar on . It just feels a little tight and crammed when I wear it . I 'll probably end up adding a string at one end just to give myself an extra 4 inches or so . The leather itself is n't a bad quality , but it 's not the finest . I 'd suggest dropping an extra $ 20 or so and getting a very high quality strap . **I just wanted to clarify that I was reviewing this product in regards to my acoustic guitar . I have read some other reviews and it seems that those using it for an electric guitar have no complaints , but being that my acoustic is a good 2-3 times as thick as an electric , it does not serve my needs .	1
I am using these strings on an inexpensive A-Style Beginner 's Mandolin ; these strings made a significant difference in the quality and tone of the instrument ; I strongly recommend these strings .	1
Need a little variety in your life ? well ... Its nice never having to look for a pick they 're just always around now	1
Its a nice pice , , easy to use and necessary when you change the string of your guitar , , , the only matter and its not a big deal , , is that make a squeaking sound besides that works perfect	1
This little mixer is handy to have around for small headphone mixes and such , but do n't expect it to last forever as is typical with Behringer products . At least it 's cheap though ! I just wish it had a power switch ...	1
I 'm impressed with these EXP16 guitar strings . * What I ExpectedA more dead sound than the non-coated strings they replaced . Coated strings usually lack the bright high-end brilliance that uncoated light strings have . * What I GotA very bright , yet not to twangy sound . When I put Light strings on my acoustic , I 'm going for easy playability and , most of all , a very bright and airy sound . These deliver on both counts . * DurabilityThe coating on these strings are supposed to prolong the time between changes . So far they are holding their tone and brightness . I will report back after three months . My last set started to sound dull , and exhibit more tone variation after six months ( when viewed with a very sensitive tuner , it seems that my dirtier strings detune sharp a bit more on attack , the harder you strum them . This is confirmed by the fact that they just sound out of tune to me when they get dirty ) . * ConclusionI will be ordering more of these . I think they perform very well for the price . Love the bright light gauge sound and playability .	1
i 've had this strap for at least a year now , and it still works so well . goes great with my guitar too !	1
I own several small tuners , including the Enote nano tuner and the Snark . In comparison to those , I would say its most like the Enote when it comes to size , but definitely more accurate and responsive . In comparison to the Snark , its not as quick to respond but still does an adequate job tuning . Its a great size and fits nicely in the pocket of a gig bag and isnt quite as large as the Snark . Anyway , it all comes down to preference I suppose . I would recommend it .	1
My Big muff PI with Wicker had hellacious noise , I mean unusable . I noticed it would change with movement so I pulled the back off and immediately found paint overspray where the grounding spring from the circuit board meets the inside of the housing . After aggressively scraping the paint off , the pedal operates as I would expect it to.I really like the tone and aggressive drive of the big muff and the Tone and wicker switches are nice although I find that with the Wicker opened up/ON the noise level gets marginally too high ; so long as you 're playing hard and loud it 's not really an issue . This pedal is n't designed to be quiet when you 're not playing so do n't be fooled there , it is normal for it to make some noise when there 's not guitar input/strumming . The bypass on the other hand seems to be clean as advertised.I 'll be keeping the pedal and like it but the lack of QA from my proudly made in America fuzz pedal was a bit of a let down ; fortunately I found the problem and fixed it myself to avoid a return .	1
I tune by ear and the old fashion way , but this is so much better and locks in the note so you can really tell what you are doing . Great tuner .	1
The ZT Lunchbox is some sort of new technology that allows LOUD and GOOD sounding tone to come through a box the literal size of a lunchbox ! I was amazed at how small the amp was when I first purchased it - tiny . Then I was amazed at how LOUD it could be and still have clean headroom . Others have reviewed and written about a hissing sound , but I have not had a problem with that . After trying it with 3 guitars ( 1 passive p/u 's , 1 active p/u 's , and 1 acoustic electric ) it remains nice and quiet . I have been using it as a practice amp as well as in a band setting.Now here 's the thing ... it does NOT have a lot of bass frequency to it , but I noticed that setting it on the floor does help some , but still not enough if you 're looking for that heavy metal `` scooped '' sound . So , I would not recommend it for you metal heads out there ; however , for all you jazzers and rockers , the tone knob makes a big difference . I keep my tone at about a 9o'clock setting because I prefer a little darker sound and it has enough mids to cut through the mix nicely still.Bottom line ... I would recommend this amp ( obviously I gave it 5 stars ) . I do n't think you will be dissappointed .	1
This strap kicks butt im a tall and big guy so its hard to find longer straps for cheap and baby is long if I have it to max its TO LONG that never happened to me and im 6 4 300 LBS so if your tall buy it do n't waste your time with the Planet Wave ones there junk too short and the leather ends are really thin and brake after a few weeks of hard usage	1
If you 're not using a pedal board these are just what you need . Good price ... .Good quality . I use them for the times that a short patch cord is better then tripping over longer cables . I use them to patch-in additional effects outside of my pedal board and they 're perfect for patching my amp head to a slave head . BUT ! ! ! ... . If you 're building a pedal board AMAZON sells , solid , double- male , connecters ( Digitech PC-2 Hardwire Accessory Premium Gold Plated 1/4 '' Male Coupler ) that work great and really clean-up your pedal board .	1
With all the other great reviews noted here , I decided to buy this guitar . Had a Rogue 12 string a few years ago and sold it as I was not that impressed with it . What a difference with the Epiphone . The fit & finish speaks quality . Playabilty is very good with low action and good tone . Really is a great buy !	1
Bought this as a back-up to my AT system and have only tried it in my living room . Home tests show it works fairly well in that environment although I think I hear a little distortion if I turn the gain up too much ( I do n't think you can change the gain on the AT system ) . My only nitpick is that I 'll need to use an adapter to go from the guitar plug to a 1/8 & # 34 ; . For the price , it 's amazing . I just hope it works in the field as well .	1
This strap looks better in person than on the computer . It has a nice soft feel and does n't scratch the neck like the belt straps do and the color goes well with a varity of instrument looks and colors .	1
This combo string winder , peg extractor and string clipper serves all three purposes adequately . It fits easily into a gig bag and is light and easy to handle . It is inexpensive enough that I have one in each of my gig bags and cases . In some ways it 's like a bic pen , it 's cheap enough that if you leave it someplace or lose it you can replace it .	1
The Danelectro FAB series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget . The D-8 600Ms Delay effects pedal works great and gives me as much delay as I need . There 's no fancy bells and whistles but just good old manual adjustments that lets you dial in the delay you want with no effort at all.. This series of pedals ( FAB ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well . Danelectro offers more expensive units but I do n't think the sound is much better , just the hardware is better , but that 's my view ! ! ! . You ca n't go wrong with this product , Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product ... I have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great ...	1
I love this tuner . It measures vibration with the option to switch to microphone . I find it really useful when trying to figure out what chord I want to play next . I can sing the note into it and then I know which chord I want to play next !	1
high quality hassle free design . Very quick and easy to install and remove in a hurry and dos n't mar the finish or use excessive force , but strong enough to move the capo all the way close to the next fret closer to the headstock to allow maximum room for my fingers without any buzzing . Very happy with this purchase .	1
If you have really large or heavy speakers , you might want to consider professional grade stands , but these will work fine for any speakers under 35 lbs . or so ( maybe more , if you keep them lower down ) . They look nice , and are easily worth their selling price.They do not include any additional hardware for mounting the speakers , so you 'll have to figure out what you need , and buy those things separately .	1
sturdy , strong , good quality cable for guitar , especially like the fit with the right angle plug . would purchase again if need bd	1
this is what i 'm talking about : cheap but very usual form behringer . very handy too . but i hope then would run on batteries next time .	1
The music stand is quite sturdy and well made in my humble opinion . I needed a music stand that could support a note book of music I have assembled over the years . This was great . I added a clip on LED light as well . PERFECT : - )	1
This little tuner is sweet ! I put it on my strat-style guitar and it works brilliantly . Agree with another reviewer in that it would probably not work well on my Les Paul or Acoustics , but for the 6-in line guitars it 's perfect . It is very precise and accurate , leading you to perfect tuning every use . I totally recommend this product - you wo n't be dissappointed .	1
After reading all the great reviews , I moved to these Light/Medium strings from the light gauge . They do sound much better and have a better tone than the light gauge . However , I noticed one thing that has driven me crazy . Finger slides are much harder with these strings . The lower strings ( E , A G ) just do n't slide as easily until there is some buildup in them . As a result my fingers get out of position and do n't hit clear notes until I 've slid those areas a couple of times . That 's probably due to the oil and other nasties build up in the strings or me just getting used to them . The packaging was also a bit confusing . Since there are two strings to an envelope , it seems I too easily get the strings reversed on set up . Other string makers I have tried , color coded their strings and it made it much easier to string up . Overall good strings and I 'll probably buy them again .	1
One of the great surprises in the last couple of years has been the MXR Carbon Copy delay pedal . Designed by Way Huge founder Jeorge Tripps , is a great analog delay for under $ 175.00 . Using bucket brigade circuitry , true bypass and a very simple 3 knob interface , the Carbon Copy is a very flexible unit . Utilizing the `` modulation '' switch , you can achieve a slight chorusing sound ( like the flutter from old tape echoes ) which can be adjusted via the internal trim pot.The unit has a small footprint ( like most MXR pedals ) so it is very pedal board friendly.This is truly a great sounding delay so try one out	1
This Tascam `` US-100 USB Audio Interface '' is exactly what I was looking for to record from our wireless mic with XLR outputs , directly to my PC video editing software . We professionally produce instructional videos and needed this for `` voice over '' work on existing footage . Before getting this convenient little unit we had to record into a camcorder and then import it into the PC , so this saves us a step when we only need to record audio . Here are my observations : + Plug and Play ; connected to my PC via USB and was instantly recognized+ USB Powered ; no external power needed , a big plus when using my laptop+ Good Sound ; clean and clear input+ Multiple Inputs ; XLR , 1/4 Mic , RCA stereo line , and `` Hi-Z '' GuitarMisc : - XLR input is not powered ( not a problem for us ) - Includes `` Audacity '' software , but we did not need to load itHighly Recommended !

I ordered two of these , one to hold music , and one to hold a netbook computer . I am very happy with how it performs in both situations . High quality , solid support , and good design decisions all around . The angle adjustment is very solid and it should be able to hold a very heavy book of music or a medium sized computer.The arm is just long enough that if turn the platform sideways , you can lean the music stand back next to the mic stand that it is attached to . I will try to add pictures when I get a chance.This is really two products that work together : a short boom arm with a mic attachment , and a narrow music stand that mounts onto a standard microphone thread base . I am using one stand attached to a mic stand , and a second with the arm removed , mounted directly onto a & # 34 ; Gibraltar Multi-Mount Microphone Clamp & # 34 ; . Major bonus points for making a solid piece of gear that is also modular and flexible.Note : the music stand easily detaches from the adjustable-angle part for storage . This is great , but be aware that the lock nut does not do a good job of & # 34 ; locking & # 34 ; , so if you turn the stand upside down , the it will fall off . This could be a problem if you experience frequent random gravity fluctuations.Final verdict : I own two , and am considering buying one of the full-width ( MUS-ARM 2 ) models also .	1
Good unit for the money , for sure . It is not road worthy however , in our opinion . Still , for any smaller gigs , it does a fine job . Delivery , packaging etc were very good .	1
I 've used a lot of cables and I always come back to HOSA , they are indeed some of the best audio cables in their price range on the market .	1
these strings are different and really quite nice . the high strings are thinner and thus much easier to play and bend . the lower strings retain the depth and sound of my usual strings . I really like them . only possible difficulty is that high E etc might tend to break a little quicker due to being a thinner string . I have a bunch of these on hand for my strat and my Epiphone as well the standard Earnie Balls	1
I bought these for my teen son who plays the bass . He absolutely loves them and they seem to be lasting a good while as well . Nice sounds .	1
I use these in my studio for the two amps and the bass drum . These are heavy duty and well made . Really reasonably priced . I love em !	1
These picks work well and look as pictured . The shade of pink is very close to that in the picture . I would recommend them .	1
I wanted a portable small sized amp for using my electric guitar outdoors -- but was not really in a position to pay the big dollars for one of the high end brands . There is of course , very little bass response with this one and it is a tad tinny , but hey , it 's just a 9 volt battery . I just wanted the guitar audible for practicing outside and this is a very neat little device . They put a lot of thought into this amp , and it is outstanding for the budget price . Keep in mind , you can patch another 9 volt powered device through this one to enhance it -- I will at some point run my Boss Digital Delay box through it to check that out . The belt clip on the back and triple adjustment dials are nice , and I got it in red as a change of pace , because I always get & # 34 ; black & # 34 ; with my equipment . It looks very nice and the vintage front design gives it a lot of character . Nice product , Danelectro .	1
Very nice ! ! Super vivid , easy to see color . The clamp portion seems to be sturdy and well built . This is a great buy for the money !	1
I Normally use my KORG foot-switch tuner for my guitar and basses ... this guy really had me believing in small-vibration-tuning.Three key words for this : Accurate + Small + InBeat !	1
I bought a classical guitar and then realized that I needed on of the around the neck with a sound hole hook type straps . Bought one and due to past neck surgery , found that strap painful to wear after a few minutes . Later saw this one and decided to try it . Works perfect , really adjustable , and no pressure on my neck ( since it does n't go around your neck ) . Great design !	1
This is a very good investment . Everything just sits in this case so I never have to set up any cables again . All I do is setup the input from guitar to the case , from the case to the amp , and let 's not forget the power cable . It works amazing and saves plenty of time . I 've also seen reviews that it 's VERY druable , so you do n't have to worry about it breaking easily . I love the fact that you can hide the wires and also convert the storage bay into space for larger pedals ( such as wah or volume ) . The only concern by some people was a slight buzzing . I replaced the power cable that came with it with one of the power cables that came with one of my pedals , and the sound went away . I would recomment this to anyone who travels alot , does n't have a lot of space in their room , or someone who just likes things neat and compact all the time . This item is VERY convienent !	1
I bought mine used three years ago and it works great . It works for a Metallica , Pantera type sound . You can also get good rock sounds with the gain turned down and eq . adjusted .	1
If you are familiar with Shubb 's , they are by far the best capo you can get . Some people do like the big close pin , but if you do n't , buy a Shubb	1
It supplies my microphones every time I run out . I 'm glad I got this thing . I rate it five out of five stars .	1
This is simply one of the best pedal boards out there . It is very well made , resistant , tough and very flexible as you can adapt a wide variety of power suplies and keep your pedals in great shape . Looks good too . I would recommend to get a few roles of power-grip pedalboard velcro as it definetely holds your pedals much better than the 'industrial ' velcro included , especially if you have a combination of both regular size ( MXR or Boss ) and bigger pedals like a Cry Baby or a VOX Satchurator or Time-Machine Reverb . If thinking of purchasing one of these , you would probably have a few thousand dollares invested in pedals , so this would be great for you to keep them protected and organized . Now , if you are on the road for long , I would suggest to get the hard case instead of the soft case . For eventual gigging the soft case is more than ok .	1
I only do test recording with this digitally to get a better Idea of my learning process from the other side . It gives a clean crisp reproduction of every flaw I have .	1
They said you could hook up a volume pedal to raise and lower the note you 're playing up to three octaves , but I could never get that feature to work properly.From video reviews I 've heard on YouTube , this Harmonizer does not even come close to the Boss version , but it costs about $ 100 less . Since I am not a professional musician and I am just playing around with it , it works just fine . And ... you get what you pay for.Addendum : I 've now owned this for a while , and discovered that it can turn my six-string Strat into a bass , by turning the balance knob all the way to the right , and my pitch on the second from bottom position . In fact , when I record my Dean Edge bass onto the Boss Loop Station and then record my Strat on top of it using the Behringer Ultra Shifter/Harmonist , I can not tell any difference in tonality.I am thinking of selling my bass . It has just become a needless expense . Needs the neck adjusted twice a year , the strings are expensive , and it is harder to play then my Strat .	1
The ultimate guitar cleaning tool I love love love this kit ... I 've been using the products for years and I 've been nothing but happy with their quality	1
I purchased this before I have ever changed a string . While waiting for it to come - I had to change one . Youtube videoed how to do it . This tool came and while it is nice and I will be sure to use it , It is not a MUST have . But I had wire snips from my jewelry kit available . Not everyone would have those . This will work great ! It is sturdy and small .	1
After online research , I decided to buy ( and found locally ) this midi pad to use in Reason 4 . Although not confirmed ( online ) as working with Reason , I was happy to see it worked immediately with no problems . My CPU is Windows 7 , but it worked on my MSI netbook also . This unit also worked in Ableton Live ( as stated online ) . I would recommend this pad to anyone looking for an affordable midi drum pad that works in many music programs .	1
This works fine on a standard guitar . No issues whatever . I see other reviewers having issues . Not sure if that 's from rough handling . But for casual use this one is completely fine .	1
This is the 5th bass pick that I have tried , and finally this works great . It does not slide out your hand and has a soft tip with a nice sound .	1
This is more of a like it or hate kind of item . If it does n't work , you hate it . If it works , there 's nothing impressive about a stand , so I just like it .	1
I really like this cable. , It is a great , quality cord that is very durable and I think it would be a long time before I would need another one . The length is long enough for any need and the cable will obviously be around for a while .	1
This is supposed to be an Fulltone OCD clone , but to me , it sounds a bit better than the OCD , and worse.Has more low end and a smoother mid that the OCD . Thought isnt nearly as dymanic as the OCD , that may not be a good thing though , depending on your taste.If I turn the gain up past 9 o'clock , the pedal sounds more like a fuzz than an overdrive , and kills the dynamics.Thats a good thing and bad , as I like a fuzz tone , but thats not what I bought the pedal for.Overall I can live with it , its well built , sounds good and the price is unbeatable .	1
This mic is well made ( heavy on the mic-end ) . However , I have yet to try it with my multi-track studio .	1
Good quality but not as nice as some pricier ones . If I want better I would shop around and pay more . Does the job for now .	1
This is the kind of guitar strap you are going to have for the rest of your life extremely thick and durable made of awesome material ... buy it	1
Arrived on time and highest quality and have the felt washers to further protect your guitar ... very easy to install , but make sure you drill a pilot hold so your do not injure or split the wood on your instrument .	1
A friend and I have run across a luthier who makes some cool stuff as well as repairing/restoring older guitars . My friend had a Tele custom made for him and needed a case so I ordered this one and it hits the spot . The neck is cradled in there nice and the guitar does n't move at all . My buddy likes the case so I am happy.Nothing gets 5 stars - there are no generals present .	1
I have a bunch of instruments ( synths , back up recordings , ... ) plugged straight into my bass amp for home recording/practice.. Having this one helps reducing the amount of cabling hanging everywhere . It works fine . It is lightweight and feels sturdy.Only drawback : I tried getting straight into it with my musicman active bass , and the preamps saturated in low frequencies . Input has to be kept within a small range .	1
I like the durability of it , and the on/off switch . it came with a carrying bag and a mic holder + adapter . its not as powerful and clear as i though it would be , but its far better than the other mics in the price range that i have used . i have n't tried this through a PA live yet . i just bought an Helicon voicetone and im hoping it boosts it a little . im sure i will have this mic for years to come and hopefully i can spring for a better Shure later on .	1
I 've got three of these simply because they work and they 're easy to carry from place to place ... and I insist on a stand for my guitar , none of this & # 34 ; leaning ' stuff .	1
Very good reliable product to help keep track of your guitar picks.Only thing I can see negative about it is that you can not fit very many picks inside of it.It does help to have a few stowed away for when you need them.I was not satisfied with the extent of time it took them to ship this product to me.It seemed to take forever although it has nothing to do with the product and only the vendor I ordered the product from.Dunlop has always created some very top quality products for guitar players.They have a great reputation and they uphold a high level of quality no matter what the product usually.This product AS ADVERTISED DID NOT come with any picks.If you order this and need picks MAKE SURE YOU ORDER PICKS SEPARATELY .	1
If you perform at gigs , you know what a hassle it is transporting all your stuff to and from the venue . This is a very handy stand for keeping your guitar upright and safe where size and weight are important considerations . I used to bring along a much heavier stand that was n't really designed for portability to keep my guitar from being knocked around . This stand does the trick beautifully . Nice job , Fender .	1
Unless you know what you 're doing , these things are too small . If you feel comfortable with your picking skills , the size and stiffness ( along with the built in grip ) are pretty good . These are for lead , and not rhythm . The picture wo n't show it , but they are about the size of a dime .	1
I used these on my ukuleles , and they worked well enough that I bought tow more pairs . They hold a regular strap well , and work particularly well with the leather strap attachment from a Uke Leash ( google it , those are fabulous ! ) .cheers .	1
Very cheap and great for price but recording with this is n't the best idea . good for live performance on a budget	1
I just bought this amp for my Epiphone Goth Studio guitar , I 've got it this weekend and I 'm very satisfied with this product . I 'm not a proffessional but this amp is really good for the price you pay as it comes with so many functions , with complete add-ons on th webpage . Solid , nice sound , very good quality to make anyone happy , except your neighbors.Now after a couple of months I want to say ... this is great product in terms of sound , not so great in terms of small building detailsGreat for Blues style , just use it with clean and good reverb or crunch and you will get amazing blues sounds.My only con and that 's why I have reduced it to 4 stars is the fact that one of the corners protectors came broken and also , the Phones are not working . Better quality control at the plant can avoid this things to happen . I wrote to Line6 and I got useless answers about .	1
For anyone who has had the experience of a strap coming off at the most inopportune time and seeing your baby go crashing to the floor only once , is enough to justify a strap lock system of some kind . I mount my guitars on the wall when they are not being used , so I wanted a strap that can be put on and taken off easily . Anyone who removes and reinstalls their strap knows that it does not take long for those eye holes to become loose . Also , I did n't want to have short & # 34 ; strapletts & # 34 ; dangling from my guitars while it 's being displayed . So for the couple bucks they cost and 10 minutes , I get everything I wanted . Quick release and reattach of the strap , the piece of mind that it 's not going to just randomly drop one day , And they come in all the standard finishes , chrome , black , gold , nickle and they do not detract from the visual artistry of the guitar while on display . I have these on all my guitars and always will . As an added bonus , once you have these on multiple guitars , you can quickly swap out straps as often as you change your underwear .	1
My rhythm guitar player recently dropped and broke his SG because of no strap locks . I bought him a set of these . I use them because unless you standardize you need a separate strap for every set of locks . This eliminates that issue and is short money next to a guitar repair .	1
I 've got two other Levy 's cotton straps that I picked up at local brick and mortar stores and they 're fantastic ! I picked one up on Amazon and I was unaware that there was an 'extended length ' version and that it was what I had bought before . I suppose it 's just easier for theNo big deal though , just an observation worth noting because if you just picked one of these up based on prior purchases ( and you 're a big guy like me and/or you play with the guitar/bass around your knees ) you may not be getting what you thought.In any case , these are very comfortable ( soft edge ) , they stick on you ( as opposed to some other materials which may tend to slide down ) , and they last .	1
Very very useful . Like seriously , unless you are very very good , you can QUICKLY get a sharper tuning with a snark than you can by ear .	1
Shipped fast , sounds great and the price was way better than a lot of other places that i know of	1
I 'm a new user , but seem to be a Great product ! ! ! ! Ca n't complaint ! ! ! I finally got it and saw how great it is . It has plenty of roomy pockets , great padding , and is put together with great quality .	1
I am proud to have this product . Fits my fender well looks amazing ! Great quality in it also . I am pleased	1
This is my 3rd set of cables I ordered from Amazon . I needed a lengthy cable for my requirement so ordered this one . The finish is not bad on the outer PVC layer and coated zinc alloy body . Works fine with my mixer . My previous set of cables ( totally 4 cables ) , each one of them develop some kind of problem after few months exactly on the same spot . I guess the inner strings somehow gets broken and stops working . I would see how this goes and update the review . If this one also would result in same condition , I would look for something better . The only reason I ordered the same ones again and again was because of the pricing . They are not expensive to replace .	1
I do n't know what I would do without this little shelf on my music stand . I works on my non-Manhasset sold-shelf stand , holds my pencil/highlighter/flute swab & even occasionally a small speaker set that I have for my phone . It easily slides over the lip of my music stand and is reasonably secure . Very well worth the $ $ .	1
Originally received the wrong item , but I contacted customer service and they returned my email that night ( on a Sunday ) and said they would ship out the correct product the next morning . I received the correct item in one day as well as a postage paid envelope to return the incorrect picks . Great customer service , and love the pics ... the color in the pictures does n't do it justice !	1
I love these strings , and use them for all of my acoustic playing . Best of all , I can find them here for $ 3.49 per set , so I 'm not dumping a bunch of money on strings all the time . Easy to play , and they sound great.long lasting if you take care of them by wiping them down every time .	1
I have been playing for 17 years and have seen alot of patch cables . These are great quality and for the price you cant go wrong . These are currently the only cables I use on my pedalboard . Short of monster or mogami , these are the best you can get for the money .	1
Very sturdy stand suitable for stage use . This stand even accommodates a double neck . Its not very compact when folded but I 'm still giving it 5 stars .	1
This is definitely a microphone stand for amateur use - it would probably fall apart fairly quick `` on the road '' or if it were adjusted constantly.That being said , it 's a great little stand for low duty/home use . I 'm using it with a Blue enCORE 100 microphone , which is n't really heavy , but still weighs close to a pound . This stand holds it very sturdily , and with the boom feature , it can be set up in just about any position I would ever need.If you have a fairly lightweight mike and just need something to set and forget , this is a decent stand.And for less than $ 25 bucks , it 's a bargain .	1
Simple , strong but easy to apply , comes in a variety of colors . Have n't used it a great deal , but it seems to be great and non-damaging to the finish on the guitar . The handle sticks out farther than a simple elastic strap capo , but this is a good choice at a great price .	1
Good quality guitar cord.Very low noise , repairable , effective strain releaf , thick rubber cover ! ! This is a great buy , under 10 bucks for a quality cord.Of course I just got it..it might not be durable but it looks durable.If I change my mind about anything I will update my review.For now , I would say , buy one ! ! Joe	1
-1 star for plastic ... otherwise excellent , YouTube has many reviews on these , The FAB pedals are great values , For what a flanger is for me , this is perfect , great sounds great price .	1
Well , this is a very simple accessory , but also a very convenient one . You can transport and organize your picks without making a mess inside the gig bag .	1
My son needed a Capo , expensive at music shop where he takes lessons . At Amazon found what he wanted at reasonable price .	1
If you are considering this guitar , I have to assume you 're shopping for an electric guitar at the lower end , not trying to decide between this and a Gibson Les Paul Custom . It is in the category of beginner/intermediate guitars that I rate this a 5 star instrument.I really could n't find anything `` wrong '' with it . Yes , it has shortcomings as compared to the more expensive Epiphone Les Pauls , such as having only two controls for volume and tone , rather than four , which also means it has a slightly different look that the famous Gibson . But you were n't planning to try to fool anyone , were you ? Beginning players would be well advised to focus on developing their skills and honing technique , rather than fussing around with tone controls anyway.The sound is good , and I found the appearance and finish of mine to be just fine . The pickups are surprisingly good . The same electronics are found on some of the more expensive Epiphone Les Pauls . It was no great surprise to find that the strings are no good , although it would sure be nice if they did n't cut corners on such an inexpensive component that is also integral to sound quality.As for fit and finish , reading the reviews has convinced me that there is a lot of variation in both , and it is luck of the draw whether you get one that was made on a Monday after a long weekend of partying . For several reasons , if I had this to do over , I would not buy it online ( nor would I buy it from GC ) . Better to inspect the actual guitar you 'll be buying , and do n't be shy about asking them bring out another one if you do n't like the first one you see.I discovered too late that my local music shop would have sold me this guitar for about the same price , but they would have included a full professional setup , including string change . You are likely to find a similar deal where you live , because the smaller shops are having to do more and more to compete with the Internet and GC.As it is , I took my guitar to the local shop and paid for a setup . It had some intonation problem , the action was too high , and as others have commented , the strings on this guitar need to be changed immediately . I asked the luthier his opinion of the tuners , as I 'd read a lot of people trashing the tuners . Bearing in mind that he had a financial incentive to steer me toward replacing them , he instead assured me that they were fairly decent , and advised against changing them unless a problem develops.Out of the box , I was a little unsure of my purchase . However , now that it 's been fully set up and new strings installed , I am quite pleased with this guitar . I do n't believe you will find a better guitar , or even close , at this price level.I did a lot of shopping , and considered guitars up to $ 500 for my first foray into electric . I was tempted to go with something more expensive , on the theory that in a couple years , I 'll want to upgrade anyway . Now I 'm glad I chose this one . For one thing , this is a guitar I 'll always enjoy having around . There is nothing cheap or toy-like about it . In 2-3 years , my tastes may change . I may want something completely different down the road , and now I still have that option . Had I gone with a more expensive model , I 'd feel locked in . No good ! BOTTOM LINE : If you 're shopping for a guitar in this price range , I think you 'll be pleased with this guitar . Buy it locally so you can see the exact guitar you 're buying , and negotiate to have a setup included , because it will almost certainly need one . Have it set up right , install some quality strings , and you 'll be very happy with the Epiphone LP Special II .	1
i must re order soon because i broke one string yesterday , these are the best strings i 've ever had i love them and may bands use them too	1
I was looking for a crunchy type distortion but this is more like a overdrive . I do n't hold it against the pedal though . I have a Marshall Class 5 and this pedal actually sounds a little bit like the overdrive I get from the amp , I say this as a compliment . In my case , however , why would I want to replicate what I already have ? I 'm gon na return it and save up some money to get a BB preamp . You should check out the 78 Badasss Distortion from MXR too .	1
If you 've read my review of the much cheaper Hohner Old Standby Harmonica , Key of C you know that I love the Special 20 . It 's great for beginners or experts alike . Sounds great right out of the box and plays well . I was able to bend notes right away with this one , while other cheaper harps take a long time ( or never ) to break in properly . All the notes/reeds sounded good . If you 're serious about playing , you will be very happy to have this harmonica around . I 've had many different kinds over the years and this one is my favorite .	1
Picked up a cable to test on my new pedalboard , and I could n't be happier . Does n't suck tone , cables are sturdy , and they sound great . This replaced a normal straight 1/4 inch cable and saves so much space on my board .	1
This capo does exactly what it should . It clamps the strings tight to there is no buzz and it does not change the tune of the guitar when used . I have 4 Kyser capos , one for each of my guitars and will never buy another brand .	1
Will work on any instrument . You do n't need the expensive ones , this works just fine..just wish the batteries lasted longer !	1
I 've played guitar for 5 years . Seen many different capos , but none that quite satisfies me as the Kyser.You really ca n't go wrong with this capo . It is very mobile , easily adjustable , sturdy , and durable.What 's good about this capo is that you can use it as a regular 6 String capo and still turn it around to use it asa Cut capo . The transparent rubber piece does the same job.It comes in different colors also.I own the black , silver , gold , and camo Kyser capos.I also own the Cut Capo for other styles.I recommend it ! All the capos I 've had from Kyser are still in great conditions.Use them all the time at church and at home	1
This item was received well packed and on time . Provides a great sound for my needs and would recommend it to all my friendks .	1
I 've had one of these I 've used for years and it has served me well.I needed another so that I could get more headphone mixes out of my soundcard for recording multi-person bands in my home studio.Simple to set up : you get an input for your source and 4 outputs for 4 people to listen to the source and each one gets to control their own volume. [ ... ]	1
This thing is relatively heavy for such a small stand . Of course one might think that would translate into sturdy , and one would be correct . Super simple to use . No buttons , levers , or knobs . Just pop it open . It does n't have an actual mechanical locking feature , but the design is such that if you fully open the outside legs they will basically lock in place . It holds my acoustic securely , and I have no fear that it 's going to tip over on its own . When you 're done , just nudge the outer legs to `` unlock '' them and it 's super easy to fold back up.I had a Fender mini acoustic stand , but it did n't fold flat enough to fit nicely in my gig bag so I figured I would try this one . I am quite happy as it does in fact fold flatter . HOWEVER ... .. I can only give it four stars because when folded the three back feet stack up and give it about a 2.75 '' thickness . If Hercules could have figured a way to avoid that , this baby would truly fold as flat as a magazine . It 's still pretty flat and takes up less room in my bag , but I think the Marketing guys used a little creative license with that description . ( Either that or they 're comparing it to the Cosmo year end recap issue . ) Still a great little stand and I would buy it again if needed .	1
Strings are half the battle with stringed instruments . A bad pair of strings on a nice instrument sound awful , and a good pair of strings can make a cheaper instrument sound tremendously better . Either way , stringes drastically effect the sound of an instrument at any price point . These strings make my cheap ukulele sound not-so-cheap , and I imagine they would do even more wonders on a uke of a higher price point . I also play guitar and Martin is one of my choice brands for strings so I figured they would n't let me down when I decided to play the ukulele - I was correct .	1
Awesome audio interface . Perfect for my beginner studio setup . All set to trade my tracks with fellow musicians around the globe . Easy set up	1
Bought this strap for my acoustic guitar however the neck button was to close to the neck for the wide locking device at the end of the strap . Nicely made and works well to retain strap to guitar .	1
Works just as I need it to . Adjusts easily , nice width , comfy enough for me ... ( I ordered one and had a problem with the pins lining up and had to exchange it for another one . Sam Ash was very courteous in fixing the problem . )	1
It is lighter than most , fast and easy to set up and not bulky while strong and sturdy enough to support heavy 15 & # 34 ; speakers.The material and paint quality is not the greatest but the price is good and it will last long enough to worth the money especially for me gigging 4-6 times a week .	1
I use this boost in the effects loop so it 's after the preamp section of the amplifier . It gives the boost I need for my leads without effecting my tone whatsoever . I will always have one of these on my board . Very well made .	1
This capo is lightweight and really tough , it is stiff and takes some strength to open but it stays in place and does n't damage the necks of my guitars . I 've used this on acoustic , electric , 7 string , 12 string , and a lot of 6 string guitars and it always works perfectly . I think it 's a really nice tool and it does the job flawlessly .	1
It works perfect with Cakewalk Music creator 5 and a Digitech vocalist . Best price out there .	1
I was using a Kyser capo , until the spring action loosened up to the point it would n't hold all the strings down . I thought I 'd try something else out and settled on this one . It 's easy to take on and off . It 's tight enough . The main positive is that the part that lays against your strings is longer than a kyser so I think it will fit even the widest fretboards . I do n't know about a 7 or 8 string though .	1
This tuner gave me problems at first because I did not know how to use it . You have to attach it to the guitar in order for it to work , which is pretty cool . You do n't have to hold it or put it on your leg . Also , this is very accurate and gives only a slight range to be in tune . It is a great product .	1
I bought this based on video reviews on the net . My first impressions : To my ears , if the OCD / Ultimate OD simulates `` fat '' power tube distortion , this pedal simulates a lightly distorted tube pre-amp , with a bit of edge , sharpness , the kind of edge the tube amps have . The focus knob seems like a tone knob , maybe more in the upper mids than the treble , but it does the job well.I wish it had a bit more gain . Surprisingly , this pedal with the gain on 10 and the tone on 10 , gives me a great metal tone all by itself ! If i boost the pedal with say a few db of clean boost , it gets me exactly where I 'd want to be ( a dry , tight metal tone , kinda 5150ish . And while this is n't the purpose of the pedal , it is how I 've ended up using it just because it sounds better than any amp sim and produces less heat than my tube amps . It 's tight , its raw , there is no fizz and no boomyness , just a healthy low end . Crank the knobs on this thing to 10 and you have a very aggressive , tight tone that makes even my Marshall Class 5 tight and grindy enough for Scandinavian style metal.Over all though , this is great for lightly distorted / edge of distorted sounds . It gave my clean tone a sharper , more `` amp like '' tone ( that is , midscooped slightly with the tone knob in the middle . ) I think this would be great for Hendrix covers on his cleaner stuff , it just has that chimey , vintage amp character ( very early marshalls , older fenders ) with the ability to go from clean to dirty with simple attack variation . If your clean channel is overly `` flat '' , this will liven it up to more `` sharp '' , scooped tone , which to my ears sounds more vintage.Basically , from Hendrix to modern de-tuned metal ( with a definite mids emphasis - not `` 80s marshall mids '' but modern mids emphasis ) .	1
This is a very sturdy and well-made bag . Much better for the money than I was expecting . I wish I could find a guitar bag that was this nice ! My uke is very cozy inside . The pocket on the outside has a lot of space for your picks , kazoo , ukulele stand , whatever you need to have with you.I carry an iPad around when I play -- the full size iPad does n't fit in the outer pocket , so I put it on the back of the uke on the inside . An iPad Mini would probably fit .	1
Used these for years on son 's electric guitars . No fuss . Mechanics do not seems to wear out , still gripping . No way at all to knock the guitar off the wall . No neck damage to axes . Mounts well , but try to find a stud , certainly . Keeps the guitar far enough away from wall that brushing against it does not hit the body to the wall.No complaints . If you 're going to drill your wall , is it really worth it to buy a simple fork style wall hanger with no means to keep your guitar on it if it gets bumped when for a few bucks more you can get the undisputed champion of guitar wall hangers . All 5 star reviews on this baby . And I agree , and I add to that total . 5 stars	1
The Snark SN-8 ( B ) Super Tight All Instrument Tuner is the best Snark tuner I 've purchased , of 4 models . This SN-8 , has a matte type finish , not glossy , it has a gun metal black look to me which I prefer to the glossy finished models . The dial , is easy to read , the bars on the dial are bold . All Snark Tuners are a great value , they function as well as any brand .	1
The Behringer 302USB Premium 5-Input Mixer is just what the doctor ordered . Nice unit and works perfectly for vocals/guitar/ bass guitar and keyboards . Do n't lock yourself down with a bad USB/ 1/4 : cable	1
The previous reviewer obviously got a defective case . The case I got works incredibly well , and always keeps the guitar well protected , and my back comfortable while carrying it . It has a lot of space , and it looks pretty good too . I 'd recommend it to anyone ! EDIT* I 've had 3 good years with this bag , and it has still yet to rip on me .	1
I desperately needed a real audio interface , I was tired of my toy Behringer 1 i/o RCA usb thing . After reading reviews online , this seemed like exactly what I needed . It 's small , lightweight , and fits nicely on my desk . It 's got some solid pre 's , and has enough for me to work with . I did n't need the extra i/o enough to break the bank , so 2i2 is all I wanted . I 'm really pleased with this , the quality is great and the ease of use is just as great . It handles line and mic inputs just as well , and the general rule of thumb sticks here that ~70 % ( about 2-3 o'clock on these knobs ) is a good base level for the pre 's . Phantom power works fine , and the direct monitoring switch is really useful . I do n't like dealing with latency in Ableton , so to be able to just monitor directly when I 'm playing instead of waiting for it to go through all that processing is great . And the headphone volume and monitor volume are right next to each other ... all in all I 'd say the design of this is very user friendly.Some people reported driver issues with this , and I ca n't say I 've really had any problems . I 'm using Windows , and I have to suggest using the ASIO drivers whenever possible . I had some issues with iTunes where the audio would just stop and the level ( in the Windows sound menu ) was frozen at whatever had been playing . All I had to do was disable and re-enable in the device , but that got kind of annoying . I e-mailed Focusrite about it , and they were pretty prompt with getting back to me , but the problem kind of faded away so I never really figured out what that was . I started using Fubar2000 because it supports ASIO , and I have n't had ANY issues with any program that uses an ASIO driver . I have since started using iTunes again as well ( still much easier to manage the library in there ) , and the problem has only manifested itself once or twice since then , so who knows .	1
I love the Tortex .50mm picks ( red ) . I have one that 's over 4 years old and still going strong ! Yes , the turtle and writing eventually get rubbed off , but they never leave black residue on the pick or the strings . I use the red , yellow , and orange Tortex 's exclusively for practice and performance ( I 'm a church worship leader ) . My highest recommendation .	1
What do you expect for two dollars . I use this on a mic stand i got for my rockband mics . It took a little bit to shove the mic in and its just plastic , but seriously what do you want for two dollars . Its solid and it holds a mic , the seller had it to me in a few days before amazon got me my mic stand if your not a serious on stage rockin mother ... ... you cant go wrong here .	1
this is a great strap . nice tight fit , snug and secure and very flexible . Best part this strap gets long long long . Yep here it is .	1
I usually do n't use anything lighter than 10s because I think the tone starts to get thin on both the highs or the lows . I had already tried these in the 10 gauge size , and when these were offered via the Vine program , I thought what the heck . I have a guitar which I believe the tension is always high and tried these on that instrument . They do seem to help the string tension issue and the low end sounds ( to these 62 year old ears ) quite comparable to the 10s . However , I do think there is still a thinning of the high end , but that 's subjective . I gave the 10s a 5 rating , and , realistically , I would give these 4.5 id I could . If you 're into 9 gauge strings I recommend these , but I 'll stick with 10s and 11s .	1
I have reviewed these strings before , and frankly , I was n't all that impressed with the tone the first time around . I think they feel great on the fingertips and they 're very playable , especially for a picker , but I just was n't sold on the tone . To be fair , I only tested them on a few of my dreadnought guitars , and found them lacking . There seemed to be a drop-ff in tone when switching from my usual strings ( Martin SPs ) to these.So this time , I decided to try them on a much smaller guitar . I have a Yairi Alvarez AY-20 , which is a 000 sized guitar , and they sound terrific . I 'm no engineer or physicist , so I really ca n't explain the mechanics of it all , but they definitely sounded much better on a much smaller guitar body , and they produce a very clear , bright tone across the higher range , and hold their own on the low range.I still do n't think they 're the best thing since sliced bread , and I still think they 're a bit overpriced , but I have no complaints about the quality other than the fact that the coating seems to wear off sooner than I would expect . This seems to have no effect on the tone , but for what these cost , you 'd think the coating would last a lot longer than two months ( I play daily for at least 30 minutes a day ) .Overall , these are good ( but overpriced ) strings that definitely work well on certain types of guitars . You 'll just have to experiment to see which guitars sound good with them , and which do n't . In my experience , large body guitars lose tone , but they sound great on a smaller body .	1
ordered a few of these ... should come in different sizes ... but for the price these are fine ... keep em in every case ... enjoy..will buy again	1
First saw on YouTube video , how genius ? A pick that stays in hand ... Makes me wonder how ever played without them ... Small price for big help !	1
This is a nice product that is perfect for someone like me , basically a one man band . Guitar is my primary instrument and I am a decent singer , but not great . This can help clean up my vocals and is helpful if you occasionally stray off key ( a little ) . Very simple to operate . Like most swiss army knives it can do a lot of things pretty well but none of them great . Hvr , considering the price , I think it 's excellent . Would buy it again if stolen ( as they say ) .	1
It 's a cable . It works great . I do n't see any reason to spend more money on a short cable like this .	1
There was nothing wrong with my original neckplate , but I was replacing the rest of the hardwear and pick this up just to add just a little something extra . IT was a direct replacement for the original .	1
Ca n't complain about a price like this ! ! ! Does the job just fine for what it is , not really anything more you could ask for . Comes with the proper attachment pieces that you need for most ( if not all ) microphones , folds up nice and small . Happy all around !	1
Great capo ! I 've tried a lot of other capos , including some pretty expensive brand name capos , and these are still unbeatable at keeping just the right pressure on the strings .	1
I have seven of these that I use on my Ibanez AM73 's , but they are perfect for anyAM series guitars ( like the 93 ) .The bag is well padded , and not to expensive.It seems it is always on back order which tells me they are very popular.The dimensions are : 41 '' L , 14 '' W at Bout , and 3 '' Deep . It has two large zippers ; the head zipper goes all the wayaround , and the bout zipper stops before entering the bottom area which is the ONLY draw back to thisgig bag , as with ALL deeper guitars , you want the bottom ( bout ) zipper to at least complete the bottom areato make placing and removing easier.This is the best gig bag I have found in the last few years for the smaller bout guitars that does not cost too much .	1
Very fun to use.Comes with a power supply.Very easy to control.I enjoy using this to play alone - It is easy to lay down a rhythm and then play over it.It can be used for drum tracks or to practice a section of a song that you want to repeat .	1
replaced my old bridge assembly with this new one and it really brought the strat back to life in terms of looks and feel . also this was priced right in my opinion ... .	1
nice item ... works well ... great price , no need to own one of the more expensive ones for the job it does . I have to type more ... oops got enough typed : )	1
While on the surface the pocket sounds great , the picks either fall out because they are n't pushed in far enough or they are impossible to grab because they are pushed in too far . There is also a tendency for the picks to fall out when you put the guitar on a stand , which is a bit annoying.The strap itself is just fine and is a good price , but the pocket idea sounded better on paper than it works in real life .	1
this is one of the best mics in this price range . It sounds incredible , and at this price it 's unbeatable . I only use three mics , and this is my main vocal , drum overhead , and acoustic guitar mic ( although I use two mics on the guitar ) . My other mic 's are a SM57 , which is incredible and not crazy expensive , and an Audio-Technica Instrument/Vocal mic . I love this mic and would replace if it ever breaks .	1
I play guitar and it 's necessary to have the mic angled toward me to sing . Long boom mics make small stages a bit hazardous to negotiate . This little boom gives me a way to get close to my mic without having a long boom cluttering up the stage . Great product !	1
Liked this capo it worked fine . You can double this as a hand exercise device since it has a great amount of tension .	1
We 've all had guitar cleaning cloths and most do a good job . When I see the word microfiber I always think of those cloths that stick to your fingers when you are using them uck.This cloth is different it does not have the same feel as most microfiber cloths and it wipes away finger prints and anything else on your guitar body like nothing I 've tried before . With no cleaning solutions needed it magically shines the surface without scratching it.This would be great for Any instrument or anything else you want to polish without having to use solutions.Reasonably priced too .	1
I like the Planet Waves instrument cables . The cable material is very bendable and easy to work with . Great so far .	1
Whatever size you are looking for Dunlop is the best option . It lasts long , sounds great , and feels very nice . It is probably the most favored pick among all companies . I recommend the orange one for beginners , and in general would not go much higher than the green ones because when it gets too heavy it does not feel to comfortable anymore and does not sound as well , but it is totally up to what you want . Either way , Dunlop is the best and for a great price .	1
My son and daughter love playing with this mic and stand . It comes with a cord that has a standard 1/4 inch end . I plugged it into a small guitar amp . They use it mainly to sing along with their cds/mp3 's . Note that this is not really a mic I would use in my studio - it is more of a toy to be honest , but a quality toy for a young child . In that regard I give it five stars .	1
Im sure these strings are fine , I like the cobalt ones a lot they sound good on my Jackson Rose . These however or the high E the Jackson because of how you have to string it would not grab hold of it ... Because with a Jackson you have to cut the ball or whatever off the strings I was left with worthless strings my mistake , Just not for one of my electrics my mistake but I do love the other strings they offer . So im out four bucks oh well .	1
Instead of shelling out over $ 25.00 for a Line 6 A/C adapter for my Pocket POD , I decided to give this one a try out , and I 'm glad I did ! It 's well made , works great , and saved me quite a bit of coin in the process . Ca n't beat this one for sure : - )	1
I originally bought this pedal to boost an old amplifier signal and it works suprisingly well . I wanted a boost which did n't color tone and this has worked well for my needs . The price is good , I bought it locally for the same price here.Since I have bought this pedal , I have upgraded the speaker in the old amp and still use this to boost the speaker to use with pedals . The tone is transparent and boosting pedal output is great . I use it with distortion and overdrive with good results.I have found new uses for my pedals which suffer from volume drop by putting this in front of them . All in all , besides for a good EQ pedal , this boost is effective and worth every penny .	1
( This review is legit ) I bought this mixer back in august or september , cant really remember , but i had a horrible experience with this unit , but that 's my fault , i bought this mixer without looking at reviews or anything , so i didnt know how to use it.I hooked this up to my desktop through the pink microphone input , and got a horrible , terrible mix , the hiss from the fan ruined it ( i nearly had a panic attack ) , so i took like 9 months to do research , and found out that behringer made the uca202/uca222 for this unit and the 802 mixer , to remove the hiss and unwanted noise.So buy this with the uca202/uca222 to clear up your recordings , do not buy a `` rca to 3.5mm cable '' if your using this for a studio setting like me , and if your beginning like me , do not let these wealthy people fool you , you dont need thousand dollar equiptment , the podcaststudio usb ( from behringer ) would be fine.So all in all , with my cheap microphone from radio shack and this mixer , the quality was good , but the hiss ruined it ! ! ! ! ! Use a usb audio interface with this from behringer , do it , if you want 5 star audio quality ! Their website has asio drivers to assist you , ohhh and go on YouTube and search up `` uca202 studio '' , you 'll get videos to help.Please , please , please , please do research before you buy anything ! Good day everyone ! ; D	1
Installed one on my CF Martin , almost leaving a thumb super-glued to the inside of the guitar . An interesting experience - would have been almost comical to arrive in the emergency room with my thumb stuck to the inside of the guitar . I 'm sure that some of my DNA still resides in the guitar.Bought another for my brand new Taylor GS Mini Mahogany after hearing what a great acoustic sound was coming from the CF Martin through a brand new Kustom Sienna Pro30 acoustic guitar amp from Amazon . I 've read that folks prefer the K & K ; over the made-for-the-GS-Mini-Taylor-pickup.Get it .	1
I always purchase Grovers for my guitar straps but my 2014 Gibson Les Paul Standard Plus had a bigger strap knob so I bought this Dunlop and it fit the guitar perfectly . A good guitar is a big investment and you owe it to yourself to protect your investment with a good strap locking system .	1
Just to confirm several other reviews - these hangers are really nice . They add a nice look to your room and they perform a much-needed function very well . As other have said , though , the drywall mounts are pretty much useless and I DO N'T recommend you trust your guitars to them if installed in drywall ! Even my lightest guitar was pulling the block away from the wall , so there 's no way I 'd trust any of my `` proper '' guitars to these things ! I bought some heavy-duty anchors from the local DIY store ( you can get them from Amazon tooTOGGLER SNAPTOGGLE BA Toggle Bolt with Bolts , USA Made , For 3/16 '' -24 Fastener Size ( Pack of 10 ) ) and enlarged the hole in the block slightly to accommodate the thicker screw . Much better ! I have a few of these , holding up a Les Paul type , a Strat , a Godin and a G & L ; tele and they 've been holding up ( pun intended ! ) fine for a few weeks now .	1
Decent quality for the price . Fits the acoustic guitar as intended and seems comfortable to the person it was purchased for .	1
I got this for Christmas last year , as a beginner learning guitar , this is a must have , works really good had mine for a year and it is still working and had n't had to replace the battery 's yet , , and I tune my guitar every time I play , well worth it , , its so easy to use ,	1
This is an iconic fuzz pedal . Yes , Smashing Pumpkins used this pedal but Corgan also used a Fender Blender ( which is similar to the Big Muff but has an octive thing going on too ) . This is not a subtle pedal . It 's cuts through the mix well if you are running into a cleanish amp . I find that it gets a little muddy if I run it into an amp that 's already breaking up . I can say the same thing about most fuzz pedals though . This is not a wooly , splattery vintage tone like the Dunlop Fuzz Face . It really has it 's own thing going on . It 's not the kind of pedal that I keep on all the time , but it 's a cool tool for the sonic toolbox . If I had it to do all over again I would likely buy the Big Muff with the tone wicker switch . It 's about ten bucks more and has a little more tweekability .	1
These D'Addario strings are great ! I am currently using them on my Epiphone Sheraton and compared to the Fender Bullets I had been using , these stay more uniform in tone throughout their life . Intonation is good and I 've noticed less breakage as well.These strings are a bit bright but have plenty of 'good ' sparkle too and really sound good on my Strat , even more so than my Sheraton . Being from the 'old school ' I still much prefer strings to be packaged individually in paper , but what can ya do ? Besides that , I am totally stoked and happy with these . I think I might try 9 's on the Sheraton but even as is they play ( and sound ) very good .	1
It 's hard to argue with this when you consider the price they charge for what it does . It works and it 's by far and away the best cheap option to go when you want to record audio to your computer.I use it with Audacity . At first , I found the recordings to be rather noisy with lots of hiss . After fooling around for a couple hours trying to figure it out , I thought it was just because the audio interface was a cheap product . The next day , I fooled around with it more and realized I needed to turn the mic input down ( in Audacity ) and turn up the gain halfway on my mixer . When I did this , it completely shut out the hiss . I 've been making great recordings since.It 's a plug and play tool , but it should come with some kind of instructions for problems like I experienced . However , they are just a matter of setting up your computer properly because this thing works very well.For those wondering about latency , obviously there 's some . You 'll get latency with any type of recording device . You just have to account for it in the settings of your audio editing program.The only other thing that is a legit complaint is that playback is a bit noisy and hissy in the headphones if you have the headphones turned up high . It does not sound like that in the recordings , though . So , it 's OK . I can deal with itThis is a very good product and ca n't be beat for the price . When it comes to quality , you have to set it up correctly . When you do set it up properly , the quality is fantastic . It would be nice if there was some kind of troubleshooting guide that came with it , though .	1
so cheap I bought one for each of my ukuleles.. would never use a pitch pipe again , and I guess I might be tone deaf cuz i can not tune them without these .	1
When it comes to noise gates , this definitely does the trick . It had a noise-detection sensor , so it knows when you are playing guitar or not , and will turn itself on and off automatically . This means that while you 're not playing , it 'll block that annoying static sound your guitar and pedals make - and when you start playing , it 'll lower itself so that it does n't effect the noise of the guitar . It 'll sound the same . I would defeinitely recommend . Plus Behringer is the best brand for pedals .	1
It is n't the softest strap . But the width makes it feel better till it 's & # 34 ; broken-in & # 34 ; . Good leather that should last a long time . I have very similer straps that have lasted 30+ years .	1
I needed a footswitch for a variety of applications to include an acoustic amp , guitar amps , and other guitar/audio gear . Built like a tank and completely configurable . Well done again , Roland !	1
These heads are virtually indestructable and produce a great sound . Attack is superb , especially when played hard and loud , and the construction ensures minimal ring and overtone.Be aware that this head pack does not product the best tone and sound for jazz ( get Remo Fiberskyns for that kind of sound ) , but the Pinstripe model that comprises this pack has become the De Facto standard for rock.If you still have the heads that come with your drum kit - and play rock - changing over to this pack will probably make a dramatic improvement in the way your kit sounds , regardless of whether you are playing a budget no-name brand , or Pearl , Mapex , Tama , Ludwig or similar pro quality drums.I also recommend that you get a Rhythm Tech Memo Key ( ASIN B0002E2EOE ) or Evans Torque tuning key ( ASIN B0002D0HZI ) to allow you to quickly get your heads in perfect tuning once you have them installed . Either of these will allow you to get the most out of these ( or any other ) heads and transform your kit into a finely tuned , professional sounding set of instruments .	1
Terrific All-in-One Must-Have Tool for Guitarists ! I have been using the older style Planet Waves model of this winder/cutter/bridge pin tool and when it came in I was a little skeptical about the new model.I am happy to see that the changes are relatively minor and if anything it is just a little bit smaller so it will fit inside your case compartment more easily leaving more room for other junk.I have used the Planet Waves tolls for years without any difficulty or problems with breaking , bending , becoming dull or unusable . They keep on keeping on and I have one in every case.Buy , you 'll love it , and if not , you can always return it.Hope this helps !	1
Got it for $ 5.00 bucks and wish I 'd bought about 5 more.Just as good as anything else out there , Onlky complant is the adjustment to the neck support does go as low as I 'd like , but that 's my take on it.Buy if you need a stand.For the money , you wo n't be disappointed .	1
There 's nothing complicated about this purchase . It 's a cable . It works . It does n't cost a lot . It 's a great deal . Get it.I use it every week , and it still sounds perfect . Then , again , I never mistreat my equipment .	1
I use this short stand for mic'ing my guitar amp cabinet . It is pretty small and on the edge of `` light duty '' but I would n't call it cheap or crappy . The adjustable features work well and feel like they will hold up reasonably . I do n't use it for gig'ing so it is n't getting beat on but it seems to be a pretty good mic stand and the price was great . I also purchased a `` musician 's gear '' [ http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018TC7BW/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title ] similar mic stand which was a few dollars more , I think I prefer the musician 's gear unit becuase it 's a bit beefier than this one but I still like this stand and it was a great value . This unit folds up particularly compact which migh be and advantage for some . Both are perfect for home recording and practice studios , likely even hold up to some gig'ing .	1
These impact pads came very fast and do their job although one of the pad I received ive already warn through in less then 3 weeks	1
Ive been trying different strings for years ! ! ! Ive been stuck on elixirs for some time now and wanted a change . These are very bright and clean ! ! ! ! very playable ! ! !	1
so I never had the luxury of the Grolsch brand strap locks.I tried to raid the water bottles at the local cafe , but alas , I was too slow.It 's a bit hard to forge a strap lock out of a Carlsberg bottle cap.So the Fender ones will do just fine , plus they come in 2 colors and say Fender.Time to open another Carlsberg , cheers Fender .	1
D'Addario strings have become the favorite for all my guitars , and now my two mandolins . Consistent quality and good tone and volume have made me loyal to the brand .	1
This capo is expensive . The first time I ( and everybody else ) saw one , I said , `` Wow . I can get a Kyser or something for fifteen bucks . Get out of here . `` Five capos later , I realize that I could probably have just shelled out the money , instead of purchasing every other capo on the market , one at a time , over the last fifteen years.The first and last thing that really needs to be said about the G7th is this -- it does n't put my guitar out of tune . Virtually at all . I can capo all the way up to the seventh or eighth fret and my micro-sensitive tuner shows that I 'm still within one glowing light of being perfectly on . That 's it . Yes , the G7th is sleek and beautiful , like a tiny sculpture , and glorious to look at , and sometimes I just want to stare at it . Yes , it 's easy to put on , just a mere squeeze of the hand away from being perfectly in place . Yes , it appears to be sturdy enough to outlive me and my descendants . But the tuning thing is all that really sets one capo apart from another , at the end of the day , and this one kills it.I own three Shubbs , a Kyser , a Dunlop , and one of those rolling capos . They 're all good . I do n't hate any of them . But this capo takes away all the uncertainty and irritation of being a fraction out of tune with the rest of the band , or with myself . It makes playing guitar with a capo effortless and a joy .	1
I 've been in professional broadcast studios that do n't have mics as nice as this one . Good flat response , but you can also click the bass roll off and get a little cleaner voice if you do n't like to EQ after the fact . Sounds like a million bucks .	1
I 'm not very familiar with how pop filters actually work , apart from getting rid of unnecessary peaks when recording . I have noticed an improvement in recording quality with this pop filter on . I do n't know how it compares to other pop filters though , but this one seems like it works for me .	1
Fender Heavies , what more needs to be said ? Great price for the quantity . Just buy it so you do n't have to worry about losing a pick or storing extras around various places .	1
I have another headstock tuner that I 've had for awhile . This Planet Waves PW is about the half the size and works just as well . The clamp that holds the tuner to the headstock is a little flaky , but the tuner works like a champ . Nicely backlite for those low lighting conditions . Compared to my other tuner , it 's rigt on the money . The other plus is that since it small and my guitar case has a little wiggle room , I do n't have to take the tuner off .	1
The Planet Waves Classic Series 10ft Instrument Cable is basic , but works great and is very flexible . Seems sturdy enough to last a long time .	1
I purchased this along with a new guitar for my daughter . The item works fine . It is not overly strong or stable , but the prices was right .	1
Perfect to try different sizes and shapes ! ! great quality . Buy it if you do n't know which size or shape will work best for you .	1
This was a great addition to our studio here at [ ... ] The price was great and quality was awesome . Highly recommend	1
Not too much to say , it 's made out of foam , made to slip between the strings , made to hold two picks . I have several of these , for acoustics and for electrics . My son lost one before during a performance on stage so it is not that secure that it wo n't be dislodged , still , it does stay on majority of the time . I do recommend this . My son 's guitar teacher calls this a `` fancy little pick holder '' and I 've had people ask where to buy one when they see it for the first time . One must also be careful , my son lost one of these so I know it is a possibility of it falling off . He lost it after performing in a play on stage.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you , it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews , and leave a comment if you have any questions , I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help .	1
Tried D'Adario EJ36 Extra Light 12-string set on my Eko Ranger XII 12-string acoustic , and the EJ11 Light 6-string set on my Takamine . No trouble stringing or tuning either set . With the 0.012-0.53 Light weight strings I tuned a full note lower than normal to ease string tension , and they still sound fine . Good acoustic , but a rather strong metalic , sound with a nice `` ring '' , and notably more metalic than the EJ15 Phosphor Bronze strings . Sound does deaden over time , as expected , but I especially noticed deadening on the high E and B non-wound strings , losing some of their `` ring '' . ( Tried Elixir 's for better longevity , but they did not sound as good to me as these D'Adario 's . )	1
Had the old stamped one and was upgrading all the chrome some I put one of these on . They work perfect and look good . You get 2 in package ( with screws ) so I have a spare.Update I only had one on E/B but went ahead and added one for G/D . Works and look great ! ! ! google `` stratocaster string tree placement '' if you are unsure of where and how to install .	1
This microphone is great for singing with a PA and an electric guitar . I sing worship/praise songs and southern gospel and it is very smooth in the mid range and when you get up close it enhances the bass nicely . I do n't think it is the same as an SM58 but it is exactly what I need . Built to last and it is a Shure .	1
I 'm in a situation where I have to sit to play due to hip problems , and it has been tough finding the right on stage seat . For me , a stool is too high , and a folding chair too low , plus I need something that folds in with my other equipment.On it 's tallest setting , this gives me the exact height I need . I 'm 6 ' , so it might not be high enough for a very tall person.It is also sturdy , I 'm very animated when I play , and the support feels solid after several gigs of 2 to 3 hours . The cushioning is nice and thick as well .	1
Well like everyone knows this is the copy of the Boss but a lot cheaper than that . It works just fine and i 'm happy with it . Anyway if you mean to play at home or in a garage or if you have a band to perform this is a good pedal . If you want more from a pedal the Boss is the one you are going to pick , but overall you should give this a chance .	1
They are cheap when bought in the 3 pack and they are very quiet . I need to order a couple more packs though !	1
for the price of this winder/cutter its awesome , if it were made with a harder plastic would have been perfect !	1
The snark makes tuning your guitar easier and faster than anything I 've ever seen . It does wonders for tuning your guitar and cuts down on the time to tune your guitar . The music stores ca n't seem to keep these in stock because they are so popular . The price in the stores is $ 20.00 and at Amazon , you can get it for half the price . I saw no difficulties with using the tuner and it was up and running on the guitar and is easy to use .	1
This is a great addition to any stereo system today , assuming you still use your turntable . Two passes with this brush will clean up any of my records and get them ready for play , free of any annoying pops or clicks . It wo n't save a dirty record , you 'll have to buy a cleaning solution for that , but this brush will easily take care of dust , hair , and other particles that get attracted to your LPs during regular use . As another reviewer suggested , I do the first pass with the brush going with the record , as if I was spreading out paint or something like that , and that gets most of the surface particulate free . The second pass is with the brush going directly against the motion of the record , and this cleans out the dust from inside the grooves of the record . After that , your record will sound brand new again ! There are definitely more comprehensive cleaning and maintenance options , but none that are this easy and this cheap .	1
This mic is absolutely awesome ! It looks and feels SO high quality . The sound is stunning . It could be a tiny bit better for the price , but I 'm absolutely pleased with it overall . Best mic in this price range by far !	1
It is simple , accurate , takes up very little room , and has several modes that are nicely backlight . To top it all off , it 's about half the price of any other pedal tuner . Korg ... king of the practical tuner world .	1
I have yet to install this neck , but have purchased enough necks over the years to have a really good idea of what to expect . There is little to no evidence of corners being cut , just to start . Materials and labor all look good to great . Measuring for fit and specifications is on the money . Not having the mounting screw holes drilled is actually a plus as most & # 34 ; econo necks & # 34 ; seem to be off by at least 1/8. & # 34 ; I 'd rather have the trouble of drilling them from scratch than having to plug them with dowels and re-drill . Frets look good , and nut looks good . Until I can install it , I can only really vouch for 4/5 stars.Long story short is this neck looks better than many I 've had that cost 2X as much , or more . Unless it has a twist or hump , it actually earns the 5th star . Even if the frets need a little cleanup , it still earns the 5th star . While some may not like the flatter radius , I 'd argue that it makes it easier to get the frets in so that they are n't as much of an issue . And it is clearcoated - maybe not a nice amber finish , but most more expensive necks may have no finish at all . So again , another reason for the 5th star .	1
I have both the Fender G-Dec 15 and the 30 and the Line 6 Spider Jam just blows them away.The controls are much more intuitive than the G-Dec line ( like hitting the level buttonto bring the drum beat volume down so I could hear my guitar over it ) , and I was able to immediatelybring up whatever backing tracks , or drum beats I wanted and the only time I had to lookin the manual was to figure out how to change the tempo which is very easy.I only mention these capabilities to compare with the Fender line.Once you go further into the amp and get into the dubbing/recording it takes a bit moreeffort and the proper foot pedal.The amp can get really loud and I do n't see why you could not use it to gig with as long asthe venue is no larger than a standard bar or side show.Since I have only had the amp for a short time , I ca n't say anything about how it will holdup , but I have 8 other amps by different companies , and the quality is just fine.By the way , I have a G-Dec 30 for sale ? ? ? Addendum : The following is my take between the Jam and the 4 series , do with it as you wish.A modeling amp will literally model existing Amps , Artists , and Songs from different years.The Spider 4 does not have on board song or drum loops like the Spider Jam.If you are trying to get a specific sound of a band or musician or place in time , then the 4 isyour amp.If you need a practice amp , go with the Jam.I have both amps and as far as I am concerned , the Jam is a far better modeling amp as it does what the Spider 4 does plus drum and song tracks that you can play along with plus a whole lot more , even if it is based on the Spider 3 technology with a JM4 Looper as its engine.While the Spider 4 ( I have the 150 ) is a nice amp , it is VERY SPECIFIC to the user needs and isnot that flexible.I do not agree that both amps are worthless without the foot pedals , as I used the Jam for a longtime without , and only acquired the Express pedal when I ordered the Spider 4.Also be very aware that the Line 6 documentation on their amps is very , very lacking , to put it mildly , and there so-called on line videos and user groups are just as lacking as their documentation .	1
We bought this tester for our son to use for his band 's equipment set-up . It appears to be well constructed , and should help to diagnose problems with cables as they work through equipment connection issues .	1
My axesEpiphone LP Studio deluxe plustopFender MarauderTakamine G320Squier Standard StratSquier Standard PJ bassBeen playing 20 years.I had a Squier bullet and it was a cheap guitar I did n't care about that I could keep next to the couch to play rocksmith with . But it got old and I wore the frets out so I needed a new cheap guitar for rocksmith . I picked up the LP special 2 in black at Guitar Center for $ 130 and they kicked in free strings.Bought it for a game , but soon found myself using it more than my other guitars because it sounded so good , played so well , and had a killer tone.My LP Studio had it 's pickups replaced with the Zakk Wylde 81/85 's which made for good metal but it lost some of that bluesy tone that passives have . Imagine my delight when my inexpensive epiphone had great sustain , tone , and playability . Considering this thing is almost the same prices a Bullet Squier , it is easily twice the guitar for that price . You literally can not find a better guitar for $ 150 than the Special 2 ... ..Sound : 5/5Two passive humbuckers have a great sound with glossy highs , deep lows , and they put just the right amount of dirt on a tone for a gutsy clean or distorted sound.The pickups were wax dipped and did not have the microphone feedback effect.The pickups are high output and feel like AlNico more than Ceramic . Not sure which they have.So much sustain for a bolt on neck . I was shocked.Build Quality 4/5I did have 1 problem with the high E tuner . I did n't notice in the store but the string peg was 1/4 '' up out of the headstock . When I discovered this I loosened the string , whacked it with my fret hammer and it popped right in and stayed that way.Intonation required no adjustment.Action was exactly the way I like itNeck was straight with no fret buzz or excessive bow.The finish was perfect . No nicks , blemishes , just oily black goodness.Neck was flush with no gaps or seams , and professionally shimmed . Damn good for a bolt on.Hardware is typical for the price but does the job , stays in tune very well.Back bending headstock and 3x3 orientation mean no string trees which makes tuning much more stable.The bridge is similar to my LP Studio with the tunamatic setup . Individual strings may be intonated but action is done with two nuts , IE can raise one side higher or lower but not individual strings.Weird having the toggle between the volume knobs but I soon got used to it . No pickguard and it does n't need one . Lots of relief between strings and body . You wo n't find yourself hitting the pickup housings or body with the pick . Makes it easy to clean too ! Truss rod is behind a nice body color plate.Frets were smooth , rounded , and played nice . Could use a little buffing for silky smooth but not rough.Neck plays fast but the nut took some getting used to . I would catch it on my hand when fretting at the top , soon got used to it and it was n't an issue.500k pots and side body 1/4 TRplug keeps the cable out of the way.Overall 5/5Came with hex keys for setupCame with an awsome poster with all the Epiphone guitar modelsCame with a nice bumper stickerNo manualBody was packed in foam shroud with foam blocks , about the same as any other $ 150 guitar.Summary : This guitar is the best bang for the buck of any instrument I own . It sounds good enough to gig with out of the box . IT 's well built , plays well , and if you treat it well it should give you years of great music . The frets are medium jumbo 's and a little deeper than a fender meaning they should last longer before needing re-fretting than a typical Affinity or Bullet ( 2 squiers in this price range ) .I would say this guitar is suitable for all styles of music . I did blues , metal , country , and pop . The pickups are humbuckers which means they are darker and higher output than a Fender , not as much of those nice Fender bell like tones and chime but it makes up for it with power and clarity.One thing I like about Epiphones and Gibsons is the volume pot is not close to the bridge . This makes it VERY easy to palm mute and play with high gain . I lay my pinky and the knife edge of my hand lightly across the strings right where they hit the bridge and it makes a nice mute but on my Strats the damn volume knob is in the way.As an experiment I took the pick up pole scews out of the bottom pickup to see if I could get a single coil sound out of it . What happened was a mess because of the parafin wax which got EVERYWHERE . The tone was a little brighter and output a little lower , still no hum but you would n't fool anyone into thinking it was a single coil . I ended up putting the screws back in.I will likely put my LP Studio stock pickups back in ( hell yeah coil tapping here I come ! ) and move my EMG 81/85 's in this LP Special 2 and make myself a nice little metal guitar.Do yourself a favor , buy this guitar even if you already have a better guitar . It 's cheap enough that you wo n't care if you bang it around a little , and good enough that you will enjoy playing it for many years .	1
bought because cheap and trying to keep my electric guitar strings in good shape if I decide to pick it up again .	1
I have a lot of pedals ... In fact , I have 2 distortion and 2 overdrive pedals ( though only the MT2 and the OD3 are regularly in my rig . ) This pedal wo n't give you a `` cranked up tube stack '' sound . No ... Instead , it 's very edgy and smooth as can be . It has a mid-sweep knob on it to help sculpt your tone . I usually use it as a mid-boost for solos . You 'll find that you get amazing sustain and a huge sound that you wo n't be able to replicate ( easily ... I 'm sure the huge Boss distortion box comes close , but for the price ... ) with any other pedal .	1
These are fantastic and unique guitar picks . I love the hologram effect and the cute babes as well . It 's always nice to have a conversation item and these little ones age great to show off to your guy friends . Love them , and they 're good quality picks too so I will use them .	1
A great deal here on Amazon , these cost a lot more a few years ago , it appears Chief bought Raxxess and is now doing the manufacturing . The shelf I received has slots all over it ( instead of a bunch of screw holes ) , this makes it really easy to mount things . I 'm ordering more of these , they are thick metal and strong enough to hold heavy gadgets.Good luck and good music to all .	1
Very authentic sound reproduction . Simple to install but be aware that the instructions are not very clear . The threaded end is 'holed ' so you can hook it with a wire to pull it into position on the tailstock . You 'll never get your arm in there far enough . LOLYou will need a 15/32nd drill bit to complete the install .	1
Forget all the volume drop comments . There is n't any and it does not color your tone one bit . I have tried a couple miniature novelty pedals . They were more like a boost volume and tone pedal with tremolo thrown in . I wanted something to dress up slow ballads , and of course `` Born On The Bayou '' . This pedal goes from nice subtle background effect to deep depth if you want it . And no variance in your guitar tone or volume when you click it on . I play a lot of acoustic solo and this really is a nice addition to change up my sound here and there and not over do it .	1
I 'm a beginner ukulele player , and I bought one of the cheap ukulele 's here on Amazon . It did n't sound very good , and I did n't know if it was the instrument or the strings . It was the strings , and I 'm very glad I replaced them with these strings . They make my ukulele sound like it should , and it holds tuning pretty well . I 'm very happy with the purchase .	1
I play using this device . It is portable , so I always have it with me . I tune the A to 432 , and this works well for that . Has a tuner and a metronome . What 's not to love . Best to carry a cable to plug into the guitar , unless you are in a quiet area . It is sensitive , and will pick up ambient sounds to give false readings . This is a good thing : it 's sensitive .	1
This little simple looper sure is a ton of fun . Beware that there is a learning curve to looping . With trial and error you can get your groove going seamlessly after a while . I 'm a little disappointed with the sound quality of the loop playback , could be better . I use this mainly with a double neck bass/guitar . Compliments well .	1
I bought this thing not thinking I would use it too much , but wanted it for future use , I was wrong , no more misplacing picks for me . Highly recommended , also fits on my guitar stand , very cool .	1
Fender 1A-SX2S-JTXK 10-Feet Performance Series Guitar Cable ig good Stereo cable for guitar or keybord.It 's long enought . I recommend it	1
I do need a boom to keep the mic . stand away from my guitar when I 'm playing and singing . This Posi-Lok Mini-Boom is a nice clean look and is very functional . On Stage has a well built unit here . I have ordered several ! Highly recommended . Best price I have found is at Amazon .	1
Replacing your pickguard ? Lost a screw ? Authentic replacement screws if you need them . I ordered these with a new pickguard for my Strat in case I lost or boogered up one of the screws . Exactly like stock screws .	1
This is a great music stand . Very solid feel . No need to over tighten the adjusters . It holds my heaviest books without tipping over .	1
My buddy used this for a long time so I thought I 'd give it a try . Shines up guitars very nice . I use it every time I change my strings for a little zaz . It does It 's job in fantastic fashion , but does n't last the longest . The shine will fade soon enough , but looks great while it lasts .	1
I use these strings on most of my acoustic guitars , except for the smaller Takamine New Yorker and A & L ; Ami ( I use the D'Addario custom lights ) . I have grown a fondness for the Phosphor Bronze strings because of the perfect balance between the warm full sound with strumming and bright tones when picking . ALso , the brightness is retained longer than other bronze and brass alloys I 've tried , such as Martins and Elixirs . These strings are quite durable and long-lasting . In the 10 years I 've been playing , I 've never had these strings break on me ( I 've broken Martin and Elixir strings in the past ) . The color-coded end balls help with the restringing . I typically get the three-pack so I can restring a trio set of my herd at a time . I really ca n't complain about anything.The individual gauges are : .012 , .016 , .024w , .032w , .042w , .053wHighly recommended .	1
What do you say about a little chip of celluloid ? Well , almost everyone I know who plays has a preference in guitar picks . These do it for me . I like the look and , more important , I like the feel in my fingers and on the strings . They also seem to make a good , clean sound . I use an Ibanez electric and a Gibson acoustic as my favorites out of seven guitars . Maybe , it 's all in my head but , these feel good to me using any of my guitars .	1
This foot controller is wonderful switch between all four channels and the volume pedal wah pedal and built in tuner makes it the complete package for my line 6 amp ! ! !	1
If you want a little more & # 34 ; meaty & # 34 ; sound and feel on les pauls and similar guitars , this set is the ticket.Just slightly heavier feel but much more tone.As usual , after switching to heavier strings you may have to tighten your truss rod a bit to compensate for greater string tension .	1
By recommendation , from the Acoustic tech people , I purchased this for my Acoustic 300B . Unfortunately it was the Wong switch . BUT & # 62 ; & # 62 ; & # 62 ; It has true FENDER quality . Well built . Heavy duty construction . The switches are rock solid . This switch can withstand some heavy , quick switch , action.. Rubber , no skid , bottom is a plus . I KEPT the switch because of the quality . I know It will come in handy sooner or later . .	1
I 've had it on my strat for a couple of weeks now and it is holding up quite nicely . Color is good and as pictured and it does n't seem to scratch easily . Installed easily ... . Only thing that was slightly upsetting is that I only received one screw ... . They shorted me a gold screw ... Luckily I had extra and this did n't bother me that much .	1
I prefer woven cables for looks . They have a nice stage presence . Hosa has been a very reliable brand for my cables . I do n't move around on stage so the 18 feet gives enough length to connect to my mixer . This cable is just a little stiffer than some I have but that 's OK for me and I 'm sure it will wear well if you move around on stage .	1
So I heard these were good , and ordered one to try . I was really amazed at the quality and awesome feel of it locking down.A must have .	1
Like many guitar players , I have a few effects pedals of different brands and I needed an alternative to nine volt batteries to power them . At one of the guitar forums I frequent I started a thread about powering a TS9 Tube Screamer with a non-proprietary nine volt power supply , One Spot came back twice in the replies . Since that time I acquired a two more pedals so now I really needed something . I looked into powered pedal boards but decent boards were too expensive and too bulky me . I got creative , I ordered a One Spot Combo Pack then bought some 2 '' wide industrial strength Velcro and built my own board that fits in my hard-shell brief case.So far so good , after two months of band practices the One Spot 9V DC adapter with the Multi Plug daisy chain cable does what I bought it for , my little four pedal setup works beautifully . I 'm perfectly happy it . The One Spot adapter is well made and the cable is ten feet long so it should be long enough to reach your stage power source . The Combo Pack also includes protective caps for the unused plugs on the Multi Plug daisy chain.If you are thinking about buying this product , do it . If you have concerns about compatibility with your pedals , here is a compatibility chart. [ ... ] Power to the pedals , Rock On ! ! ! !	1
I 've been using the same Straploks on all my guitars for the past 10+ years . I have not had one fail on me ever . Just be sure to tug on it after you put your strap on to make sure it 's on right . I 've struggled with the C clip in the past , but what are you going to do ? It 's a one time thing when you first install , so it 's no biggie .	1
Well thought out unit that does what it says it will , drop all that POP ! I really like the way the clamp connector is rubberized to protect the finish of your mic stand . And being that it is rubberized , it allows you to adjust the filter to the mic without having to loosen everything up because rubber has an inherent & # 34 ; give. & # 34 ; And this is where the flexible arm allows you to fine tune the filters proximity to the singer , allowing you to do what you do best -- Sing ! And then ; and now for the really important part : everything stays where you last left it . Hell , even my cats ca n't do that , and they 're porcelain .	1
As a freelancer , I occasionally work with a band that plays the Midwest , performing on a near-weekly basis . These are seasoned veterans who have no interest in gear per se and even less interest in brand cachet . It 's all about money to them . I could n't believe it when I first saw the group using these Nady mics ( even lower-priced several years ago ) and insisting they were as good as Shure SM-57 's and 58 's . I still do n't believe the quality of workmanship compares ( any casual empirical test of build quality will prove as much ) . But these Nady 's handle the announcing , the vocals , and , when needed , the softer sounding instruments ( flute , harmonica ) , and none has broken or quit on my watch.I 'm a keyboardist , so mic power and fidelity do n't affect me . I 'm only a trifle mortified when there are musicians in the audience who catch on to how cheap we are when it comes to the all-important `` gear component . '' At the same time , my embarrassment , I confess , is not unmixed with a bit of demonic glee . After all , who 's playing -- and getting paid for it ?	1
This is a must have ! Really ! It is pack very well , and I use it everyday ! Please get one of these if you are tried of paying someone to do your guitar setup .	1
I think that this pedal is a good value as an overdrive pedal but its speaker simulated 2nd output makes it a great value as a stand alone guitar preamp ! I plugged it into my DAW and listened on my KRKs and was impressed by its sound . The overdrive is quite good . No , it ca n't hold a candle to my J. Rockett Pedals Alan Holdsworth Signature Overdrive but at $ 48.00 , it 's an absurdly good buy .	1
The title says it best , it 's a decent basic mic cable . It 's nothing special , like a canare or mogami , but does the job in a non-high stress position . cable is a bit thin ( but the supple , quality thin those that have high end mic cables will recognize ) . it was priced right @ $ 7.50 usd .	1
I 'm using this right now on my acoustic and it does its job in respect to holding your picks . It was smaller then I would have pictured , but it still is a good product . It can hold light to heavy picks and its super easy to put it and take it off . Only problem I had was that it moves a lot when putting my pick back in . Besides that , its highly recommendable to anyone . I will definitely pick up more for my other axes .	1
This is a pack of guitar strings . It sounds good on my guitar and it 's not that expensive . I like it ( 4 star rating according to amazon ) . I would rate it 5 stars ( amazon rating for 5 stars is if you 'love ' the product ) , if it made me sound like Clapton unfortunately , none of the gear that I bought can do this ! Also , I kind of find it hard to 'love ' a pack of guitar strings .	1
I bought a Pedaltrain pedal board and I have 6 individual stomp boxes that are crammed onto it . I originally bought Hosa connectors and they are high quality and have a low profile , but the selection of lengths is limited . I bought this kit with a little trepidation and proceeded to re-do the board . I swear I was done in 20 minutes ! ! The board looks awesome with all the cables cut to perfect length . These cables are dead silent and the connectors are high quality . The supplied cutting tool works as described and the only thing you need is a small-tip , flathead screwdriver with a medium size handle so you can firmly drive the locking screw into the cable for the final step . I could have saved some money if I had just bought these first instead of a bunch of random length patch cables .	1
I had purchased this cord and a 25 ' cord for an assignment I was going on . I had previously bought a shorter cord that just did n't fit tight enough into the mic . This one and the other one I bought were really a great , well made product and fit the mics tight and as they should . I would recommend these cords and will look to purchase other lengths soon	1
Small enough to keep along with your guitar to make sure it is in tune each time you play a little . I wish it was a little faster but it is close to as fast as my Sony and Korg plug in tuners . It clips onto the guitar easily , stays put , and is not intrusive by weight or size . The bars are easy to see and are accurate .	1
I got the Ocean Turqouise and they are stunning . $ 4 for these 12 beautiful , premium quality picks is a steal .	1
Like many here the case could be an inch bigger . For my Ibanez 510 I cut the bottom material along the edge against the side wall enough to take out the bottom foam and then put the material back . Now mine closes without pressure on the bridge .	1
I do question the leather part but since it does n't say what kind of leather I suppose thats fine , its still a good strap either way .	1
as expected for a beginner . I 'm just learning what I want and what I need . This cable works fine for my needs right now .	1
Not much to say about this one . It 's a genuine fender trem cover , and it will do its job well .	1
There 's no substitute for the right part . These are great . I like having extras around , just in case I rescue another orphaned guitar , to rebuild . The springs are almost always missing . Cost less here , than at Guitar Center , so bada-bing !	1
This is a great value for a practice and travel instrument . ( I got mine with free shipping ) Built like an instrument , not a toy , it is an interesting crossover between a high strung guitar and ukelele . Fun to play , easy to take along , stays in tune well enough , and it 's only a hundred bucks . I bet if you bought one you would like it .	1
Much better than similarly priced products out there for tuning . I ca n't recommend this enough and the battery last a LONG time ! I have n't had to change mine in almost two years since I 've had it ! Just a great overall tuner .	1
The last amplifier I purchased was a Fender Twin valve some years ago . It is difficult to use in a small apartment - too loud ! ! So , after giving up trying to use this with the volume at '1 ' , I searched for a smaller thing . This amp looked suspiciously cheap and , although the reviews were great , still was concerned whether it would be good enough . It arrived and I got into realizing it went on the web for downloading presets and all kinds of features , including recording . This was really a mind blowing thing . The built in sounds and effects are better than many of my effect pedals , and I no longer use my Zoom . Setting it emulate a twin reverb , with the effects used lightly , I am amazed at both the quality of this 'practise amp ' and recommend this to anybody who wants a huge bang for their buck ! ! !	1
I got this for my Epi Sheraton II : PROS : It fits perfectly ; it 's `` fur '' lined and has a decent sized internal compartment ; it 's solid and the hardware is sturdy ; it has one locking latch ( out of five ) , but nothing that would stop a real thief ; it has two knobs on the bottom that allow the case to stand on end without tipping over , two knobs on the side for when you put it down on its side , and three knobs on the back that allow it to lay down without being completely on the ground ; it 's relatively thin.CONS : It 's heavy ; the handle is positioned oddly and at an angle ; it has some `` Made in China '' characteristics.I 've had several cases and this is one of the nicest . On a personal level , I 'd prefer it did n't say `` Epiphone '' on the outside . But since it does it 's a good place to hide a $ 3000 Gibson 335 .	1
BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT : The Behringer VT999 Vintage Tube Monster is indeed a monster of a pedal . Those seeking a hot rodded sound to your amp would be wise to check this product out , as the level of boost and gain derived from the stock 12AX7 is enough to push any tube amp 's clean channel into saturated overdrive.Featuring 3-band EQ that ranges from barely noticeable to perhaps & # 34 ; too much & # 34 ; , I was surprised that I actually found myself backing off some of the knobs because I expected this to be a cheap pedal that needed it 's EQ to be pushed to max in order to get any playable tone out of it . I was wrong . The Master and Gain knobs work exactly like a tube amp channel . The Noise Suppressor is a nifty feature that drastically reduces white noise.Roughly taking up the space of 3 standard pedals on your pedalboard , many probably wonder if it 's even worth the real estate compared to other overdrives . However , when it comes to tube-based pedals , big is par for the course.The stock tube is decent to the point where you can get some musical tones out of the pedal . I personally do n't plan on changing the stock tube any time soon because I want to test its limits , but the gain range is effectively Boss OD-1 to DS-1 , so YES - it is possible to get some metal tones out of this pedal , especially those late 80s/early 90s Marshall-driven metal tones.I honestly ca n't say anything overtly bad or wrong with this pedal . I judge gear with my EARS and by its VALUE , not by PRICE , but honestly ... for $ 50 , you literally ca n't go wrong . There are worse pedals you could buy for more money quite honestly . Even with a $ 10- $ 15 mod to change the tube to something more your preference , you 're still looking at a relatively inexpensive pedal with an amazing value . But if you 're looking for other tube overdrives , check these out : Effectrode Tube Drive ( $ 350 ) , Maxon TBO-9 True Tube Boost/Overdrive ( $ 263 ) , and the Ibanez Tube King ( $ 170 ) .If you 're on the fence with this thing , go ahead and jump over and get one .	1
Exceeded my expectations on quality and price . When I saw the deal on Amazon , I thought it would be low quality harmonicas , but they are good quality .	1
i think this is the best tuner i love it it really works and its really easy to use it	1
Exactly what I needed for testing guitars and playing at home . Same as what comes with epiphone bundles but with fender on it	1
I was using a nylon strap before I got this one . I love the feel of this and the fact that its a little wider than my older strap . The leather feels very high quality and the end pieces fit snug on my acoustic guitar and I do n't have that worry of it coming loose .	1
Small size , easy to transport , and more than enough power to annoy a small venue with my lousy ( but improving ) guitar playing : -p	1
I decided to give these a try after buying just earnie balls . Wow ! Just wow ! My inexperienced ear was able to tell a difference in the sound . It was just ... Right . I ca n't explain it exactly . The .10 gauge is great for standard and eb tuning , although can be tuned lower . I would recommend something thicker for that though . But these are great and you should get em !	1
This keyboard is pretty dope . I bought this a while back when I bought my Samson 49 key midi keyboard . It 's been a little over 2 years and I 've used it ever since . I recommend this to anyone buying a keyboard in the future or currently . You ca n't go wrong with this stand .	1
Ukulele straps are a rare thing and I 've yet to find the perfect one . This one gets close . Not all uke players use straps , some do and some do n't . Purists say not to use one and that using one makes you look lazy or inexperienced . However I have two acoustic-electric ukes and they are heavier than the non-electrified ones the purists use . I 've found that using a strap on my electric ukes helps with right arm fatigue from clutching the thing . A preamp and battery adds a surprising amount of weight percentage wise to a uke when compared to a guitar . This Neotech strap frees me up to worry about my strumming and fingering techniques more and dropping the instrument less.There is another device called a Uke Leash that also works well . It ties onto the headstock . I like this Neotech better because even though the instrument is n't balanced perfectly , it is balanced better than with the Uke Leash . The Uke Leash is easier to get on and off my body so it has some advantage over the Neotech Simple Sling.This Neotech Simple Sling soundhole clip strap works on my Concert and Tenor ukes equally well , but I have to adjust it some when switching it between the two.The wide clip is felt lined and it does not scratch the instrument . I do n't know how long this felt lasts but it seems well attached . This strap should work fine on any number of various stringed instruments.You have to use reasonable care with a soundhole clip strap on a ukulele or you can damage the top by jerking down on the instrument . The clip on the Neotech Sling is wider than most I 've seen and this extra width reduces , but does not completely eliminate , that risk . The wider clip spreads the stress out . I 've seen other soundhole clip straps with much narrower clips and I 'm afraid to try them on a ukulele . I like this one with the wide clip and will keep it.The Uke Leash type strap that ties on the headstock still requires full right arm pressure to hold the instrument in place , so I like this Neotech soundhole clip device better.The only thing I do n't like about it is putting it on is a little clumsy when compared to a traditional guitar strap . But once on it is great ! You look a little dorky slipping your arm into it and then over your head and you ca n't do it with a hat on . It gets easier the more you do it.I 'd buy the Neotech Simple Sling again . I recommend it to electric ukelele players who want to use a strap but do n't want to drill holes for strap buttons on their ukes . Just put it on in private because you look dorky putting it on .	1
In my opinion , this is the best guitar volume pedal available . It is affordable and does exactly what it 's supposed to , and does it very , very well I might add . I 've tried numerous volume pedals , from Morley to Line 6 to the Dunlop DVP1 , and none are as fluid or feel as good as the Ernie Ball Jr.I owned the Dunlop DVP1 for several months , and while it did an okay job of cutting the volume I simply did not like the feel nor the low volume levels . It felt way too bulky under foot and went from about 0 to about 3 when barely applying volume . This is unacceptable when you 're trying to clean up your distortion channel or trying to accomplish a slow volume swell . But as soon as I laid the Ernie Ball down and plugged it in I fell in love . Not only does it feel great under your foot and provide precise control , it has a complete volume sweep . Add in some delay and it will give you an organ-type swell . Absolutely perfect ! I 've heard some people complain about the Ernie Ball Jr being a flimsy pedal but I just do n't see this . Of course , it 's not a tank like the Dunlop or Morley , but it still feels very solid . It 's also lighter than the others mentioned , which is a plus for traveling musicians.I would HIGHLY recommend this pedal . It is one of my favorites on my board and I could n't imagine playing without it !	1
WOW , I got more than I expected from this Chromatic Tuner , Sure it 's a plastic case , but who would be rough on a pedal anyways , had it about 3 weeks now , and im impressed , I see people say the blue indicator light is too bright , but truthfully , its OK , because the tuner lights are plenty bright enough , if it is too bright for you , just put a little piece of black tape over the light , but like i said its OK cause you can still see the tuner lights , I use this pedal with theVisual Sound One Spot Combo Pack , works like a charm .	1
This is a pretty good stand and is relatively robust for its compact size . Opens easily and folds up to a fairly small footprint for storage/transport , and it cradles the guitar nicely.Two minor issues:1 ) Personal gripe - the git leans back a bit more than I would like . Makes it more difficult to hug a wall and ends up taking more 3D space than it really needs.2 ) Product gripe - the two footer bars are not quite level with each other , so it rocks just a little bit . However , with a solid body electric on it , even a little rocking can be a really bad thing.I like OnStage and own several of their products . They are well constructed and a good value so I have no doubt I was just unlucky with this one . I 've been applying a little persuasion to even it out and it 's getting better , but with the relatively robust construction it just does n't want to give much . Kinda sucks that it 's not level out of the box , so 4 stars .	1
The reason they are called silk and phosphor is that the wound strings have silk along with steel in their cores ( the wire around which the windings are wound ) rather than just steel . This allows them to tune to pitch with less tension , so they can be the ideal string for a beginner or someone who is moving from nylon . There are also silk and steel strings with silver plated copper windings . The lower tensions and light gauges mean that they may not drive some guitar tops hard enough to let them perform up to their capability . That is , they may sound soft and cheap . I would not put them on most Martin dreadnoughts , for example . But they may work fine on lightly braced guitars . The only way to find out for sure is to experiment.These are an experiment for me , I usually use silk-and-steel on my guitar banjo , it was time to change strings , and I stumbled across these . I 'll have to see where things settle down , but so far I 'm willing to give these silk-and-phosphor the nod over silk-and-steel . The sound is a bit brighter . My music partner says she prefers the way these silk-and-phosphor blend with her fiddle.This is so `` out there '' that I wo n't let it influence my rating . My guitar-banjo 's tailpiece has small holes through which the strings must pass . The ends of the windings at the bottoms of the bare steel 1st and 2nd strings stick out a bit , so I had trouble putting them on . I was able to use a fine wire cutter to nip the end of the 1st string , but it did n't work for the 2nd string . I ended up using a D'Addario string of the same gauge in its place . Admittedly , it was a tight fit , but I was able to put it on without working on it .	1
These knobs fit well on the pots in my strat and they match the color of the black fender pickguard as well . They look nice , work well , were easy to replace , and do the job . What more could you ask of strat knobs ?	1
Let 's ' be very clear from the start : The pedal board and the carrying bag are excellent quality . The board is solid , and the bag is very well made and will last a life-time . As other people have pointed out though , Pedaltrain must have outsourced the decision to locate the strap D-rings to someone who has never carried anything over their shoulder . The only reason this is not a 5-star review is because of the D-rings . That being said , do n't let that detract you from buying this . I just feed the shoulder strap through the carry-handle and it works well enough .	1
This tablet mount allows me to use my large Toshiba Thrive in live performance situations now . It makes a solid physical connection to the mic stand , I never worry about it readjusted or slipping during use .	1
A bargain at the offered price . Gives you virtually unlimited sustain . It is a good cheap addition to my effects board .	1
Fit perfect to my Taylor T5 and no cons I can find so far . If you want a capo for guitar , this one is the one stop shopping for you .	1
Got this little guy last night to use with my Squier Tele Custom II , hooked it up and played around with it for a while and it really impressed me for the quality of effect you get for nearly pocket change ! I also have a Digitech RP-50 that has multiple effects including different types of chorus and this Fab Chorus sounds better than any of the RP-50 's chorus settings . I am so looking forward to laying down some cool tracks using this with the Tele , my Applause acoustic/electric , and my Squier Vintage Modified 70 's bass guitar . And like other folks who 've bought this product , I 'll most likely be getting some of Danelectro 's other Fab boxes and the Dan Electrode power supply .	1
This is a very well built stand , even with its slim design , which also comes with a nice carrying case . Very good for light , portable set ups . Also holds a big mic , if you position the legs right ; completely open with the mic parallel to a leg . That said , do it wrong and plunk . Will not likely stand up to a gusty wind , so use it indoors only . Paid $ 7.99 for it . Would give it 5 stars , but I know user error , will cause a less careful person , to crash some mics . Good for kick drum and cab mics , by the way , anchor it down with a sand bag , if using it for this purpose .	1
This peddle works great ! I looked at many products for , just the right distortion and this one just topped them all . So glad I went with the M116	1
The item shipped in time . It is working fine . The sound is very good . The only problem I had is voltage . I live in Europe and I had to buy special adapter which transforms 220 volts to 120.I know A lot of items from USA that work with both voltage 220 and 110 , but not this one.Thanks anyway .	1
I love this tuner . It is accurate & very reasonably priced . I have ordered this tuner for fellow musician friends & all of them love them . Best clip on tuner I have ever purchased .	1
I needed a new bass strap because my old one was frying at the ends . I choose this one because it was very durable . The nylon is very strong , I do not see it fraying in the future . The leather eds are nice and thick so the hook wont slip off the strap pegs . The guitar pick pocket on the the leather ends is a nice addition to keep your picks at hand . Good colour selection too . Highly recommended !	1
Planet waves knows hot to make great quality and economic stuff . All of the cables in my pedalboard are planet waves	1
Yep . it holds the strap on the neck of my guitar . I have a Washburn rover , a backpacker style , and so a stap is a necessity , and this works just great .	1
This cable seems top-notch to me . Some complaints I heard had to do with this brand not lasting . ( Of course , those guys abuse their equipment . ) Maybe that will be something I 'll encounter , but this cable appears to be very well made -- and it works great . I take very good care of my gear , so I expect this one to last . Only gave it four out of five because I 'd rate some other cables slightly higher . This a great cable , the length is perfect for practice , and I 'd buy another .	1
It was nice to have many types as I had no idea the thickness I would like . It also helped my boyfriend decide also .	1
I 've been using the Dunlop Delrin 500 2.0 picks . Purple ones with the turtle/500 on them . I thought I had found my pick . Because they were so slippery , I had to rough up each side to have enough texture to improve the grip ( I 'd rub each flat side against the edge of a honing stone ) . At the music store I stumbled on the Dunlop Gator Grip 2.0 . Yes they do offer a better grip ( I think they 're still a little slippery but much better than the Delrin 500 ) . But since I solved that problem with the honing stone , I was more curious . So - again , they are better , grip wise , but I was very surprised at the difference in tone . They give a much mellower tone than the 500s and since I 'm using these with flat wound 12s on an archtop - the less bright sound often is a better tone overall . 500s seem to be a harder material and are brighter . I do n't know what the Gators are made of but I do like the difference in sound . I 'm not sure how they 'd work on round wound strings - but great for jazz tones .	1
I was a little nervous for some reason when I started watching this ( I saw it in the theatre ) . I was afraid I might be in for another Live Aid let down or something like that . I had heard the epic reviews and the internet buzz when the actual event happened ... but had no idea if this would be as good as all that . Never fear , you need to see this film . The guys prove that the hype was legit . I was so stoked when they launched in to some of my faves like `` For Your Life '' even if the performances of `` Dazed and Confused '' and `` Stairway '' seemed a little pedestrian . But hey , it 's LZ doing Stairway which is better than 99 % of the music on the planet so who cares if it was an obligatory performance ? The show seems to get better as it goes along , and by the time `` Kashmir '' comes on I had tears in my eyes . No joke . This show is riveting . I bought the Blu-Ray so I could continue to experience the awesomeness of this show , which really defies description . I am not sure if non-LZ fans can appreciate how incredible this show is , or what the band accomplished in doing this . They took it seriously and rehearsed for 7 weeks for this one event . Jason Bonham did a good job of honoring his father and staying true to the original material and live nuances developed over multiple tours in the 70 's . If you love LZ you probably already have this set , if you have a passing interest only you will witness a one-night-only reunion that blows away any of the other weak attempts by older bands of this era . It 's pretty awesome .	1
winds your strings its durable and will cut your strings as well you can pull your pins at the bridge with it as well .	1
This unit has a wider handle than most of the inexpensive string winders . I 've restrung a dozen guitars in the past week , including two 12-strings , and it is holding up well .	1
Well made , proven over decades . Switched from NS capo to improve tone with a one piece mahogany neck . Not sure there is a huge difference but there does seem to be an improvement . Requires less adjustment . Square pad allows placement right next to the fret . Easy to adjust with a bit of practice.I enjoy using quality machined parts , so this is a pleasure , plus it is built to last .	1
This product is something every guitar owner needs . It is well built , performs well and sells at a very reasonable price . The sting cutter works well .	1
This partial capo from Kyser has the same design , construction , and ease of use as Kyser 's top-ranked and bestselling 6-string cano . It is definitely recommended . If you choose to go down he partial capo path , though , it 's best that you either jam with friends who are familiar with partial capos or buy Randall Wolliams ' manual on the partial capo , since its use is not intuitively obvious .	1
Well made , XLR 3 pin adaptor to mini . Needed to get a real XLR mic into the computer and this did the job .	1
The price is fair and it serves its purpose . I 'm pretty happy with this cloth . I just wish it was bigger so I could have a greater surface area of the cloth to use before washing it . I have n't had to wash it yet , but it looks like it would hold up .	1
love the case nice and simple , it really look exactly the same as the picture . highly recommend to everyone looking for a case .	1
Used this to replace a dead volume pot in an older Strat-type guitar , and it sounds great ! The diameter of the threaded portion was a little larger than the original , Chinese pot , so I needed a cheap reamer ( purchased through Amazon ) to enlarge the pickguard hole . It 's a nice , smooth pot with no scratchiness . nice big lugs to solder to .	1
I 'm not a big fan of Planet Waves because they ruined the Dare Strap , but this is a good product - it definitely helps alleviate the weight on your shoulder .	1
First off ; let me start by saying I bought this guitar because it was only $ 100 and I was board on my deployment and wanted something to brush up on before I return home.I DID NOT : expect good quality , sound or comfortably from this guitar.I DID : want something cheap I could toss around and use out here in the desert without worrying about it getting beaten up or trashed.When I unboxed this guitar I was floored ! The hardware is much higher quality than I had expected by far . The strings it came with were n't complete crap , but I swapped them out for my favorite set of strings : Ernie Ball 2406 Ernesto Palla Nylon Black and Silver Classical strings . The guitar sings beautifully ; the tone is rich and vibrant.It 's quite comfortable to play , I have no problems playing up to the 16th fret without this guitar having a cut away . I 'm not a big fan of the pick guard that has the Epiphone 'E ' on it , so I will probably end up removing it ; but the sunburst is really nice looking . I have received many compliments on the look of it already.OVER ALL : this guitar is a really great instrument for the price tag . GET IT ! Also ; I 'm buying a hard case to take it home , or shipping this guitar back home to myself because I want to keep it as part of my collection . My original thought was to buy this guitar and leave it out here at the Rec tent for other people to use after I 'm gone . Even if I do decide to leave it out here ; I 'll be buying another one when I get home !	1
I ca n't believe what you can get for the price on this one . Tunes all my instruments fast and easy . The display is so easy to read and tuning is easier than ever .	1
Well built , easy setup , very quiet . Using with Procaster , worked well enough but better with addition of FEThead , high quality unit .	1
Got this for my electric guitar . I am able to adjust it to the length I play with . Very sturdy guitar strap .	1
This looper distinguishes itself by really only doing one thing but doing it really really well at a very affordable price . To record you simply press the button and the led will turn red , continue playing . When done simply tap again and the LED goes to green and plays back . At any time in the looping process if you want to overdub simply tap the button and record and tap to finish . No need to line it up with the loop , it places your overdub exactly where you played it in the loop . If you do n't like the take a simple press and hold will erase the overdub . Want to stop and clear ( two presses and press and hold ) and your back to a clean slate . I do n't know the limit of overdubs but I have n't reached it . The amount of time for the looping I believe is 5 min so you can record an entire song and overdub to your hearts content . The tone preservation is excellent and have n't noticed any issues there . You can get a nice variety if you put this at the end of your effects change so that you can record a rhythm that is dirty and crunchy and overdub and record , then turn off your distortion and overdub a very nice clean lead over it . If I have something I like , I then output it to Sonar to play with some more.Pros- Small , very easy to use ( 1 level knob and a stomp button ) , designed by guitarists and it shows , true bypass and plenty of room for recording.Cons- You may consider lack of battery a con , I do n't , everything goes on the effects rack and is powered through AC . No drum track or click track but then again , the aim for this device was to keep is simple , I believe.UPDATE : I was having an issue with the looper one night being able to record but not hear myself . I contacted support and their response was quick but they basically said it sounds like it is broken , replace at the store which I did . It worked great then one night again , I could n't hear myself recording . I played for about an hour with different configurations , it seems not all 9V AC adapters are equal . Out of the 4 I have it only liked 2 . When I used that adapter it seemed to work just fine . So beware if you are having an issue you might want to look at the 9V AC Adapter .	1
This is super warm and can get very trippy . I like the depth it adds to everything from subtle , extreme and whatever else , the mod switch is great for the flutter effect too , nice extra . 600 milliseconds really is more than enough and I have a highend tape type unit that is something like 2.5 seconds but for what this does , more than enough . I like retro and this is it , I used this on a show the day I got it and it was noticed by all . I have to say MXR has really stepped up their stuff , very musical pedal . Again , do your Youtube homework and listen around and you 'll come to your conclusion . Amazon is great to deal with .	1
This Epiphone Hardshell case is a real bargain ! Well built and functional , just the perfect size for your Dot , Casino , 335 , or in my case a Sheraton II . Finished in faux leather , a nice scuff resistant vinyl of some sort , much like the old Fender Tolex . NICE hardware on this case . All the latches are fitted well and are both good looking and rock solid . Hinges too . The handle is n't going anywhere ! Inside you get a nice soft plush interior , the obligatory hinged compartment for strings and things , and a good solid rattle free fit for your guitar.Top all that off with 2 feet on the end for standing upright , 2 well placed feet on the side and 3 on the bottom . NO matter which way you place the case ( other than upside down ) both your guitar and case are protected . You get a total of FIVE good quality latches ( one of them locks , key included ) and hinges at either end . As I said , the hardware on the case is really good . For under one hundred dollars this case is an unbelievable bargain.I was immediately struck by how SOLID this case feels . It is no lightweight either . I feel totally secure keeping and transporting my Sheraton II in this case and unworried about it breaking apart or popping open , etc . Mine came almost scuff free out of the box , but there were a few signs that it had been handled a bit before packing . Still , it looks super and the overall visual presentation far outstrips the price.If I could make just two criticisms , it would be that I notice the stitching appears to be single stitched , rather than double stitched . Also , the strip of fabric that holds the lid open seems overly thin and not well implemented . It is a smallish piece of colored vinyl attached to the lid and case body and it looks like this will be the first thing to wear out or even just up and break . Also , when you close the case , instead of folding in on itself it tends to stick out the back of the case , necessitating you manually pulling it into the case before fully closing . I would have much preferred a nice self folding piece covered with the same material that lines the case itself . This is just a minor niggle and could easily be replaced by either yourself if you are handy , or most any music store with a halfway decent tech in the backroom.I have no reason to believe this case will fall apart anytime soon . Overall , I am extremely pleased with this case and my Sheraton II is happy to have found a long term home . An excellent value , highly recommended !	1
A good solid piece of equipment with great tone and control ! It came extremely well packed . For the price , this is one great little dynamo !	1
I put these on my `` campfire acoustic '' Black Yamaha F335 and they look stunning . The tone seems slightly brighter , however , I go through strings pretty fast so a lot of the difference I am hearing is admittedly likely a result of going from dead strings to new strings . Since they are replacing plastic pins I am going to skip scientific analysis and give you a subjective `` sounds good '' .These pins are a little thin ( small ) so they may slide out of the hole easier than the ones they are replacing . If you need to this should be remedied handily by applying a small amount of tape to the pins . This may not be necessary , however , even if they are slightly loose because the pins when used correctly are not a wedge to keep the string in the hole . The string should go all the way through the hole , into the body of the guitar . Insert the string so that you are sure the ball is inside the body at least a few inches , if possible it should be listing toward the neck . Then insert the pin with the slot facing the neck and push it in firmly . Unless you have really thick strings these slots should be ample for this . Then gently pull the string tight making sure that the ball does not grab the end of the pin . Instead it should be up against the body of the guitar and stopped from escaping back up the hole by the pin . The pin itself should not really be holding it in place all on its own . Usually the pins popping out are because the ball is actually hooked onto the end of the pin and is pulling it up out of the hole . If you avoid this you should also avoid the frustrating mishap of having the pin come flying out and poking you in the eye while you 're trying to get your guitar in tune ( typically ruining a brand new string in the process ) . If you can get your hand inside the guitar and feel the ball end of the string you should be able to feel how it it sitting against the body ( correctly ) or hanging on the pin ( incorrectly ) . Also your tone and tuning stability will be improved by making sure you have a proper string installation.These fit my guitar snugly but not tightly , however I do not have problems with them popping out despite the fact that I do a lot of string bending a whole step or more ( sometimes using two fingers ' strength to bend that far ) . Overall I am quite pleased with these .	1
I originally was planning on purchasing 2- 3 packs of xm1800s , but after hearing the difference between the xm1800 and the xm8500 it was a no brainer.I was looking to get 5 vocal microphones on a budget for a band that sings loads of harmonies in every song.I really wanted Sure SM58 & # 8217 ; s , but the budget did not allow it.I normally stay away from Behringer due to bad experiences with their consoles and compressors etc. , but these microphones were a game changer for me.They have a very full and even tone without any mud or extreme plosives , also an excellent output level to the mixer.I was able to EQ them easily for both male and female vocal ranges . I was told by all 5 singers that they could here themselves loud and clear through the monitors.I was also able to get a nice even mix on the front end.I do not know of anything better for the price in live vocal microphones right now .	1
I just got done installing these . My three guitars and mandolin take up virtually no room in my small house anymore , my guitars are decorating the wall at the same time , and my guitars wo n't tip over either . Not only was this the least expensive solution out there , but also the most space efficient ( to keep my wife happy ) .I used the screws that came with the mounts and made sure that they went into a stud . You can usually find a stud by looking for a screw or nail that the drywallers did n't get covered with drywall mud . Once you 've found one screw , then your studs are either 16 or 24 inches apart . With the mounts screwed into wood studs , I do n't see any way these are coming down . The mounts fit everything from my 12 string acoustic , to my heavy electric Strat , to my mandolin beautifully. Got ta love Amazon . With so many options to choose from , you can come up with something great and inexpensive too . And the reviews give you an idea of what real consumers are experiencing with the product.BTW , this seller really got these to me fast . This was a great buying experience . Thanks DisplayGiftSCOM .	1
just used mine for the first time today love it it is every thing behringer said it was does every thing i need it to do for my two piece blue grass show	1
Is a nice cable , ,god quality as always with the Fender brand ... Guys if you need a cable that are not high budget , , and a god quality this is the cable ... .	1
This small device has amazing quality . The built-in mic records very well compared to those tiny hand-held mono-recorders . Mic gain controls boost volume BUT add some noise ( like reviews state ) but when used on low-gain , record quite well . Audio-IN records even better when used with good microphones and a mixer ( I used a Behringer U-802 ) for AMAZINGLY clear recordings . Several types of SDHC cards work well and have NOT found a card that did NOT work with this device . Even NiMH ( 1.2V ) batteries can power this , although alkaline ( 1.5V ) last longer.CON : The plastic case is vulnerable to scratches and breakages so treat carefully .	1
As a guitarist who 's had the opportunity to work at Guitar Center ( back in 1999 ) , trying each type of string on the market was a fairly inexpensive and easy task . While I 'll chose D'Addario EXL 's for electric , Martin SP are my top choice for acoustic . The sound and reliability are unmatched for the money . They also have a neat bronze shimmer to them ... Granted that 's only aesthetic .	1
Small yet sturdy enough to hold a full-size guitar . Nothing to put together , just spread the legs and place your guitar on the two holding arms . A very good price for an excellent product .	1
Once again received a good product for a good price and fast delivery.have never had any problems with any case bought thru amazon . All latch well and look good . Do not fly my guitars anywhere but do carry them in my truck over the road and no damage even with falls along the way.have five hard cases of various brands and all bought thru amazon wirh no complaints with any of them . All fit and work as expected	1
works very well , keeps the popping to a bare minimum , easy to install , cleans in a flash , lightweight and works	1
I actually was n't aware of this gauge of string until I purchased a guitar from the great George Lynch . The strings felt different than the 9s I use on my Fenders and the 10s I use on my Gibsons . So the next time I saw George , I asked him what strings he put on that guitar and he told me D'Addario 9.5s . I love them on my Mr Scary Guitars Burnt Tiger and that is the only brand/gauge of string that I will ever put on that guitar ! I definitely recommend trying out a set .	1
I did n't want to spend too much $ $ for a guitar that I was n't sure if I would like it or not . There were a few at the local music store but 3 times the price . They were good quality and if this did n't work out then I would have probably gone that route . To my surprise , this guitar exceeds all my expectations for an acoustic guitar . The only downfall was that the frets were sharp on the one side of the guitar . The local shop only charged me $ 5 to shave them down . I replaced the strings right away . I 'm completely satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it . Definitely worth the price you pay .	1
For the money you ca n't find a better deal . I am currently overseas and did n't want to bring my good guitar along . This is a great playing guitar for the money , comes packaged extremely well and high quality all around for the price .	1
I have a number of guitars and keep them all on stand in my music room . This stand is sturdy and protects the guitar well .	1
The tuner operation works pretty well and is consistent on these snarks . It may be my imagination , but I think the recent ones work a little differently than previous generations . They seem to register differently than older ones and sometimes give you a tuning that is just a wee bit sharp.I have used them to tune many different kinds of string instruments , from autoharps to mandolins to guitars . It works with all of them.Tuning by vibration is very useful in a loud room , but it is not always perfect . If another band is playing loudly , the sound vibrations from the speakers will affect your ability to tune . So you have to wait until the band is between songs to get an accurate reading.To my taste , the display on these SN-2 's is the best of all the Snarks . I like the extra bars and the smoothness of the way the display zeroes in to the perfect pitch . It looks nice and responds well to your tuning peg changes.Finally , do not drop these . The head is purposely flexible and can rotate very easily . It has a ball joint construction . That is good , and seems to hold up to use . The plastic socket , however , on the back of the tuning head does not respond well to hitting the floor , even a carpeted floor . I do not treat my tuners rough , but it is easy to drop them . When you do , 6 out of 10 times , the plastic socket will break . I have 3 tuners whose heads are separate from the base . They still tune , but I have to hold them against the guitar . They do not clip on any more , so it is inconvenient .	1
It 's a bit thinner than the average cable.Not as thick as I would like but works well and its kind of nice and slick to put away . Very smooth .	1
WOW is all i can really say . It made a good solid state amp ( 80 's Yamaha usa-made combo ) sound great and full of nice warm tones . I 'm using it into the power amp section via effects loop ( bypassing the yamaha preamp ) and I could n't be more happy with the results . This ranks right up there as the best money I ever spent on equipment . A definite upgrade .	1
Sweet chorus , I have the CE5 , the CE20 , a CE3 and this one . This chorus is my favorite , it sounds just right , the analog CE3 is awesome but too weak , Boss should include a level knob instead of a stereo control , anyway this one is a keeper !	1
I just got it and tried it out . It 's not great but should work as a quiet practice amp . You have to diddle with the gain and volume controls to get an almost realistic sound . I would recommend this to anyone .	1
for 99 dollars , quit looking at other wah pedals ... .this one does it all ... ... its so versatile ... .sounds very authenic 60 's too , ... ..good pedal movement ... .endless variations in sound avaialable ... ..it gets a great sound right out of the box ..dig it man , , ! !	1
The build quality could be better - ideally the nut needs to be replaced ( the cut is a rush job ) and the neck needs to be reset ( there 's a gap that indicates that the pocket was n't completely cleaned out when it was put on ) - but what do you expect for this price . It is however a playable instrument right out of the box and if you 're willing to invest another $ 50 or so it can be a great starter guitar for a.young ( smaller ) player or a.nice travel instrument .	1
Got this cable to run a rockband keyboard controller to my M-audio profire 2626 to control midi in Pro Tools . Works great ! Firm fit , solidly molded ends , reputable branded cable . ( a bit on the thin side , but i have n't seen to have any issue due to this or anything . Could n't go wrong for $ 5 at the time of my purchase and prime eligibility .	1
I used this to replace a Pot in my MIM Telecaster . Works great . I did n't notice any change in tone . It just worked like the old one . But the main this is that it worked . And my Tele sounds as great as it always did .	1
I bought one for my tenor and a different brand for my soprano Ukulele , , I found I like the snark better for the dollar more in cost.. the other has multi use ( bass , chord , ukulele ) and seemed cheap , I liked the snark so much I bought this one for my concert ukulele , , you might ask , Huh why one for each ukulele , if you play , , then the answer is simple , for 10 bucks I do not have to hassle swapping tuners out , , and can just grab my ukulele and go .	1
What can I say that you have n't already read about this amazing pedal ? If you thinking about buying the other green overdrive pedal you can save big green with this pedal . If your looking to play out with it know that it 's cheaply made and can be destroyed in seconds . Have a backup . Take great care when plugging and unplugging from this pedal . That alone can cause problems ... As far as tone goes it rates very high on the Tone God List . You can go from clean to outright mean with this pedal . It has out muscled my 2 other more expensive name brand overdrive pedals and yes it has earned a permanent spot on my pedalboard . I use it mostly as a clean boost so the pedal is always on and I never turn it off once we start playing . I leave it plugged in on the board all the time . I reach down and use my hand to turn it on and off . I carry a backup pedal ... I LOVE THIS PEDAL ! ... just do n't ever drop it ...	1
If you own an American Strat or Tele , this is a must have for the neck of your prize . I love this . It proudly states the guitar 's origin of Corona . California with the Classic Fender name scribed . Wonderful . I have these on all three of my Fenders . Again , these should really come standard on all American Strats .	1
I 'm a beginner and I try to learn to play guitar . I was looking for many different capo 's but this one was my choice base on other folks review . Is easy to apply small and sexy ; - )	1
My son finds that this holder comes in handy when storing his picks . He says it 's easy to use and finds no difficulty removing his picks from the holder . Highly recommend !	1
So while I got this for my soprano ukulele ... they fit fine . Not much to say really other then they are good strings and work .	1
What we have here is an XLR male to XLR female black cable . If you 're looking for some ridiculous review , this wo n't be one.Quick pros and cons.Pros1 . It 's a nice , thick cable.2 . It 's 25ft long as promised . I measured ( not really ) .3 . It worked ( did n't arrive dead ) .ConsNone really.This seems like a nice , high quality cable . Are there better ? I have no clue , I 'm an amateur . I needed an XLR to go with my GLS ES-57 and this fit the bill . Plugged into my mixer , plugged into the mic , and transmitted proper audio from one to the other . That 's really all it 's designed to do thus , 5 stars !	1
I used other clamp type tuners and this one fit the bill perfectly . I bought my dad one , too . he loves it too ! ! !	1
These are super strings . They will last and last and last , and give you great sound . Easy to put on and tune .	1
Great strings with a good feel to them . They are size 10-46 which is just right for my electric guitars . I wo n't know how long they last for awhile but they are a bit pricey . If they hold up well then they are loud and bright on my telecaster and I will switch if they last a long time . I do n't think of these as extra lights ( 09-42 ) they are more of a light to me .	1
I 've been using it for nearly a year now . I was going to buy the Boss RV-5 when I somehow discovered Biyang . I had never heard of them , but at 1/3 the price of the Boss AND stereo Ins and Outs , I gave it a try and I have n't looked back . The 3 modes are nice . I leave mine set on hall because I 've never liked spring reverb , but the spring setting on this pedal does sound exactly like a spring reverb . The decay time in any mode is more than enough for probably anybody , and I can say the same for the blend control . Overall , this is a great pedal with lots of sounds that will suit just about any style of playing . More than enough decay and wetness . Seems well-built . I 've since bought other Biyang pedals and I have never had any issues like other reviewers have stated . I 'm not ashamed of having Chinese clones on my board . In fact , I highly recommend Biyang whenever somebody asks about it .	1
I seriously never knew steel guitar picks existed i 've been playing guitar for like 5 years . These picks are the BOMB ! , + they do n't break on you when you strum too hard/fast : D , i would rate this product 6 stars if i could i 'm completely satisfied with these picks ! Tip : These picks are great for HIGH ACTION/HIGH GAIN GUITAR SOLO 'S .	1
exactly what i needed to set up my pedal board . the flexibility is awesome , you can wind it underneath and around the pedal board and still plug it in to the pedals with out straining .	1
I previously had the UCA-202 and it worked great for me for a couple of years but I noticed the audio went dead in one of the RCA phono input jacks ( I had used those jacks previously with no issues ) . Regardless , I liked the UCA-202 so much that I got the UCA222 to replace it without hesitation , plus as a bonus , it 's purdier ! : ) Plugged it in just now , fired up the PC , the new UCA222 started working immediately ... no muss , no fuss ! For the money , I do n't think you can find a better deal for enhancing your PC 's audio versatility . I do n't know if I 'll even bother with the included software as I use a great program called Mixcraft ( btw , check that out if you 're looking for PC recording simplicity but sounds impressive as the other , costlier guys ) . Anyway , two thumbs way up for the UCA222 !	1
worked for me . Got no complaints over these . Very smooth and lasted me a while . Love Ernie Ball strings , they are the only ones I get	1
This mic is excellent , it 's pretty much a straight up clone of an sm-57 and for the money there are no mic 's even close to this one . Also the price at orange county speaker 's website is $ 29 and $ 25 in store so I 'm not entirely sure why it 's $ 50 on Amazon .	1
I tend to sweat when I play , so coated strings are a necessity for me . These are as good as any coated string on the market , I prefer the thinner coating and super light strings . Everyone has their preferences so you should try a few different gauges and manufacturers until you find your favorite string . These provide an nice smooth feel while providing excellent tone and they last reasonably well . Of course that depends on your playing style and how much your fingers sweat when you play ! Oh , and do yourself a favor and store your guitars in their cases when you are not playing them . The guitar and the strings will last longer and thank you for it .	1
This tuner is cool . It picks up even the lightest vibrations , i/e : I can hit the high e on my acoustic and it will register the tone until it pretty much dies out . I also like the capo tuning feature . You put a capo on the 3rd and tell the tuner to flatten 3x . I highly recommend this tuner .	1
They are picks for guitars and they work . They also have pretty colors . Right now I am just writing to get the required words out . If you dont want anything heavy this is good for you .	1
I do n't do heavy gigging just home studio play but I have had no issues with quality or sound . It looks cool and sounds just fine and clear . I like the metal connecters , they are easy to plug in and pull out at have a nice heft.It is not a super high quality cord but it does an excellent job for the price . I will be buying these again .	1
I have a couple of clip on mics that I tried out . This one is definitely the best . I use it on the head stock of my soprano ukes and right in the sound hole for my bari uke . You do have to find the sweet spot , but once you do , it works great through my Pignose amp , and actually fits right inside my Pignose . Great value and price too !	1
These are great cables for connecting effects pedals and I love that they have a little color ( both for fun & better organization ) . To top it all off , the price is right . Cheers .	1
This is an indispensable tool for all guitarists who constantly change strings . It is like the swiss army knife for string winding .	1
This has been a very good purchase , I have not stopped using it since I got it , good and prompt service as well Thanks again Cheers ! ! !	1
I use this in a small studio so we can use multiple headphones from only one stereo line out . Individual volumes controls make it perfect .	1
This is not a pick for windmilling guitarists . This is a pick for the precision player . It 's really small -- noticeably smaller than the red Jazz III picks . With large fingers like mine , it almost disappears . But the aggressive grip pattern keeps the pick right where you want it . It 's a very stiff pick , with just enough give to keep from sawing your strings off.The picks are first-rate . Based on my previous experience with Dunlop picks , this 6-pack will last me for years . I 'm inclined to lose a few along the way , just so I can give Dunlop some repeat business .	1
There are plenty of flashier - prettier - modern-er looking or more nostalgic looking microphones out there . Its all just so much marketing garbage . These mics are the best mic for the buck out there . Anyone who claims to be able to tell the difference between this and far more expensive ones is blowing smoke up your a** .	1
Very good string ! ! I 've been using Elixir strings for about ten years now . I 've been a full time musician for about 14 years now and for what I do these sound the best and last for 3 or more month 's . Within these ten years I 've only had 2 strings break on me , and I sometimes work 6 days a week for many for at a time	1
What more can you ask for at roughly $ 25.00 . This is a very useful guitar compressor . It is a simple compressor , that 's it . Easy to understand with responsive controls.I use compressors quite a lot . In my PA rack I have a Yamaha rack compressor and an Alesis rack compressor . In my home studio there are compressors in my 24 track DAW and in my computer I have the T-Racks Deluxe mastering software with several VST classic analog compressors like the Pultec as well as VST optical compressors . I only mention these as a way of saying that I am very familiar with compressors and adept at using them . I have a pretty thorough understanding of compression ratios , attack and release points and I have learned to use them sparringly and with care . The Behringer CS400 does a good job as a straight guitar compressor . It is usefull for taming levels from your guitar and boosting your signal which adds punch to the signal presented to your other effects and ultimately to your amp . In recording circles you often hear good engineers say that if they can hear the compressor working , it 's not being used correctly . The Behringer CS400 is quiet , almost transparent ( unlike the Behringer DC9 I discuss below ) . Yes , it is plastic but it 's fairly well made and unless you are really rough on equipment with a little care it should last a few years . If you are putting it into a pedal board it should last a long time.If money is not a concern go ahead and spend more on a rugged pedal made of metal but expect to pay somewhere around $ 75- $ 100.00 and up ( Keeley , MXR , Digitech , etc . ) Unless you go over $ 100.00 I do n't think there will be a difference in performance and even then it will be subtle . If your signal path aready has hum and static , this pedal will not change that and actually may increase it because that 's what compressors do-lower high signals and bring up lower signals for a more uniform sound . If you want to just smooth out your peaks and tighten up your sound with more punch , this little Behringer CS400 will do it . ( Behringer also makes another compressor pedal in the same price range the Behringer DC9 . It is all metal and attempts to clone the classic MXR pedal . I personally would stay away from this pedal for live use . I bought one and found that although it gives you great sustain it also colors your tone and seems to attenuate your low end quite a bit on the higher compession ratios you need for long sustain . You can dial in more low end on your amp but if you expect to turn the compressor on and off on different songs you will hear a tone difference . I do n't use the DC9 when I play live but I like it on my guitar when I record using my VOX VT30 amp . I like it better than the built in compressor on the VT30 ) .	1
If you are a beginning guitarist , like myself , you probably ca n't tell one note from another . This product does all the hard work for you easily , quickly and accurately . The only thing I needed to know but did n't was that if you get a reading of G and you need to make the reading B for the B string , the notes follow the alphabet from A to G and then begin again . So you are turning in the right direction from G if the next note is A . The one after A will be B . Seems simple enough if you know anything about music . I did n't .	1
I have been playing guitar for three decades and It seems to me that D'Addario has been around.I use light strings when I want more control and easier bends for blues songs on my electric guitar . Light strings in my hands do seem to wear out sooner , probably because I used them in this manner . It is great that Amazon stocks these , making ordering convenient . These come in a stay fresh vacuum pack , so ordering more than one and keeping an extra set around is prudent .	1
Simply one of the best string winders I have ever used to date and I love it because I having large hands it really makes a difference . Not forget the added string cutter and peg puller to boot . Very good .	1
I bought this because I had already bought a `` 1 spot '' plug but as i gained pedals , I needed something to power them without buying more adapters and this is greatest way to solve that problem . Highly recommended .	1
Great little amp . I had to take my Ampeg Jet in for a maintenance and I just love this little practice amp . I enjoy using it with both my Fender Strat and my Rickenbacker .	1
Hands down the best cable I have ever owned . I was spending money on cheaper cables continuously and now I spend that money on other stuff . I play one to five hours a day and have used this same cable for 3 or 4 months . Well worth the money . Lifetime guarantee to boot . Definitely will buy Mogami from now on .	1
Sounds great ! Still suck at bending 3 & 4 . A buddy of mine got one , and he 's killing it on the bends . we both been playing for about 3 months . Great harp . Will buy another if it ever wears out .	1
Great harmonica rack , for smaller harps . Very strong in the set when worn . A must have for any folk player .	1
For the price , this box works just as well as as any expensive one would . Just put in a 9v battery and it works right away . Three knobs to control tone , level and distortion to get that perfect sound . I do recommend you get a power adapter , because this eats us batteries like crazy . I accidentally left it on for a few hours and the juice was all dry , batteries are expensive , get the power supply . Overall , this is a good budget buy , you wo n't need to money for quality with this .	1
I did n't need anything high dollar so this was just what I needed . Does have a cheaper feel than the other ( much more expensive units I 've used ) .	1
Reading the product description may give you an idea about this product . I received , plugged it in and was impressed with the clean yet great sounding distortion . It 's solid , well made and looks/feels like it can handle the world tour.Get it !	1
I have a love/hate relationship with compressors . For $ 40.00 , you ca n't go wrong with this one . I use it a lot on my practice rig . If you need a top notch compressor , hands down the Keeley 4 knob . I use a Keeley in my live shows . Expensive but worth it . As for this Joyo , I ca n't complain . It does it 's job pretty good but it does color your tone some what . True bypass is nice , it 's noticeable in your chain , but not to much to take it out . I love for my practice rig . Good buy if you 're on a budget ( all us musicians are ) just do n't expect to blown away by it . For $ 40- give it a shot , I did and do n't regret it : )	1
These strings last a good long time and are rather inexpensive . the tone is clear and bright . I have used D'Addario for years	1
Hi guys . Really simple little review here . This is a windscreen . It does windscreen things.Pros1 . It works2 . It fits my microphoneCons1 . The package game a little smushed so it 's a little misshapen.It 's $ 2 , it works . If it 's not the highest quality stop complaining . It 's $ 2 , what did you expect , kevlar ?	1
Great stereo sound out of the keyboards.My keys had a single 1/4 & # 34 ; stereo out so this cable was needed to get it to convert to a true 2 channel stereo so we could EQ it properly and it worked like a charm . I highly recommend this cable .	1
This mic stand will work great for mic'ing full stacks and guitar amps.Some people have mentioned the counterweight could be heavier but they need to pay attention to how they are orienting the feet in relation to the microphone . You should make sure one of the feet is pointing in the exact same direction as the microphone arm so that way the downward force is applied directly onto the support leg .	1
These are nice , I like the 1.14 rigidity and these are just fine for me ... you will wear them out on acoustics though if you are a more aggressive player as I am . Once these are worn , as with most picks , they sound considerably different . Much more grainy and tin-y but that may be a plus for you ? I also like the side edges for a real mellow and / or speeding picking style . They stay in your fingers well .	1
I 've used both the ES-57 and ES-58 for several years now . They are a fantastic mic , great quality and construction . I love how hefty they are . I 've got 6 of these and plan to buy more when needed . I would probably suggest a higher end if you were studio recording but I set up for live sound in and outdoors and these work great . I have several brands ( some more expensive ) but I always come back to GLS .	1
Bought to tune my bass . Works fine and at the this price it cant be beat . Highly recommend for budget tuner .	1
Bought this for my Dot . It fits snugly and is adequately padded . The outer material is strong so I feel comfortable carrying and storing my guitar in it . A must if your already paying so much more for the Guitar that will go in it .	1
These sound good on my electrics . The best sound I got was on my strat . Good sustain and strings are holding up well .	1
Good cable and has m et all of our needs . As all of know who use cables , only time will tell whether they will last .	1
I bought 3 of these because of the ridiculously low price ... I figured I 'd get my money 's worth from them regardless . They work fine . So well , that I thought I would buy a few more for the studio . The price went up nearly 50 % on them though . BAH .	1
I 've been playing for over 40 years . I currently own 60 or so guitars . My problem with LP 's is they feel like a boat anchor around your neck , I 've bought and sold quite a few . Another problem with real LP 's , you only get one chance to drop one , just see how many used ones have head-stock repairs . They ARE beautiful guitars but not comfy for me to play . I deal in used guitars , picked up an Epi Special ll along with several other guitars at a resale shop for very cheap . I did n't mess with it until I was ready to set it up for resale . I fully expect to do a fret level on most guitars , even a lot of higher end guitars need it . I found on the Special ll the frets were actually very well done ( Chinese version from 2011 ) and only needed a slight leveling ( would have played fine without it but I am very picky ) . It did n't take much to get it set up , small truss rod adjustment , new set of 10 's for strings . little bit of adjustment to the bridge , cut the nut a bit ... .note it played well the way I got it , just like my stuff perfect . Got it set-up and plugged it in to check the electronics and that 's when I started to really become impressed with this guitar . Cheap pickups are supposed to sound muddy with no character , these sounded pretty good , actually very good , nice and bright with a nice tight bottom end . I check sound also by cranking up a backing track to stage level and playing a few tracks . It cut through really well . I noticed while doing this test that the volume had a very nice sweep to it and did n't lose any highs when turned down . The tone knob was also very usable with a good sweep , very nice . I popped off the back cover to check what was in there , full sized pots , maybe not the best quality but much better than expected . I normally upgrade electronics on my personal guitars to get the controls to operate the way I like but no need to fix what 's not broken . Yup , I said `` on my personal guitars '' because I am keeping this one for myself . The neck is very fast and comfy , it 's NOT a boat anchor so my shoulder will thank me . The tuners are the lower end trapezoid type but turn smoothly with no backlash and keep the guitar in tune fine , once again if it ai n't broke do n't fix it . Please note that most tuning problems are from a binding improperly cut nut . I 've set-up hundreds of guitars and almost all of them need nut work , does n't matter what price point you are at . This also has a bolt on neck . A lot of players say you have to have a set ( glued ) neck . I feel glue actually deadens the sound a bit , I prefer a good solid bolt on to transfer sound , IMO . I have found that the quality level of the low end foreign guitars has become very good . I know that corners have to be cut to get to the price point of these budget guitars but all in all the Special ll is good to go right out of the box with just a little tweaking . My advice is to go try one , my taste may not be the same as yours . There are a lot of good value well made guitars now-a-days , I just found at this price vs quality ratio the Epiphone Special ll really is special . Get one , get it set up for a few bucks if you ca n't do it yourself , and you will have a good instrument . Oh did I mention this is a very good looking guitar ?	1
I purchased this mic to use for screencasts ( recording what 's happening on my PC 's screen while I talk about it ) . I set it up to sit on my desktop , approximately 2 ' away from me and usedCamtasia Studio 8 [ Download ] and a free program called CamStudio to test it out . Both programs worked well with the mic and did what I 'd hoped it would do - eliminated my need for a clunky , wired mic headset.The build quality of the mic seems excellent , and the compact design is fantastic ! I love that it comes with its own carrying case and that it can be on a desktop or clipped to a laptop 's monitor.KINKS IN MY SYSTEM : MUFFLED AUDIOThe included software : Cakewalk 's Music Creator LE can be installed on one computer . You get 30 days to register it . I installed it and registered it immediately , but it would not allow me to put in my registration code , saying I was n't the system administrator . I am , and my Windows 7 PC says I am , but alas , it would n't work . This software is optional , but I decided to install it prior to the microphone ( per instructions ) to try it out . Eventually I ended up uninstalling it.Soon after installing Cakewalk , I had a PC issue : muffled audio recording . No amount of system tweaking seemed to fix it . I was stumped.Then I decided to go to the Samson site and see if there were updated drivers for the mic . The generic ones installed were from 2010 . No luck.I began reading online about 'muffled audio ' on Windows 7 PCs . Somewhere I noticed a name I recognized : RealTek , which was a name associated with my speakers on my PC ( RealTek digital audio ) . I went to the RealTek site and noted updated drivers for Windows 7 64-bit ( 2012 ) , and decided to download and install them . I rebooted my PC and tested out the audio recording once more . Much to my delight , this solved the muffled audio problem ! I did set the bitrate to the highest level for the best sound quality recording . Afterwards I tested out the mic using Camtasia and CamStudio , both worked beautifully with the Samson Go Mic ! On my desk at a distance of about 2.5 ' , this mic pics up my voice perfectly for dictation and screencasts . No hiss , hum , breath noises or distortion . Very clear and with the properly installed drivers for my audio - works perfectly with the USB 2.0 connection on my powered USB hub.CONCLUSION : BUY IT FOR GREAT RECORDINGSThis mic is a truly great if it 's recognized and properly configured by your system . Impressively clear recordings , unlike any I 've been able to obtain using aPlantronics .Audio 655 USB Multimedia Headsetor the mic on myMicrosoft LifeCam Cinema 720p HD Webcam - Black.For the price , I do n't think you can do better . It 's compact , has great voice pick-up and audio recording clarity . Installation issues may occur , but updating audio drivers , using a powered USB hub connection and tweaking audio settings within the operating system should give you the quality you 've been hoping for at a price that 's right.UPDATE : 12/30/13Been using this mic consistently for a couple months and I 'm liking it . It 's a condenser mic , and does n't filter out ambient noise as well as I 'd like , however for an under forty dollar purchase - I 'm still very happy with it . Cakewalk never has registered correctly with my system so I uninstalled it . I guess if anything , that 's been the downside to this purchase .	1
Fender springs . You 'll need a pliers or needle nose to grab and stretch them to reach the hole . There 's too much tension to do it with your fingers . My American Special Strat came with 3 springs and now has the five . I find it stays in tune like a & # 34 ; instrument & # 34 ; should now .	1
I recived this guitar today ( 2/8/13 ) and its perfect . After I tuned it it sounded great , it plays well , and it does not hurt my fingers like my old guitar . This guitar is amazing !	1
I have a Don Pablo Cuban guitar , made in 1969 , , for a few months , , , never change the strings , , and sounds great , , , I put this strings , , and wao , ,know sounds wonderful , , few guitarist fellows could not believe the sound of the guitar after the string change , , try , , this are the best	1
This pedal gives me a whole range of tremolo to choose from . From subtle warm tones to psychedelic waves of volume all for only $ 40 ! And it 's built tough like a good effects pedal should be : full metal case and solid construction , an all around great buy	1
Snark tuners are great . Since I 've bought Snark tuners , they have never broken or fell out of tuning capability in any way . I 've had some for years that I still use today without ever changing batteries or anything . They are great and last forever . This one is also super accurate and allows you to really fine-tune your instrument . It have a vibration and mic sensor , so it can be attached to the instrument or set aside played in to to get a reading on the pitch that is being played . Really nice piece of equipment for a small price .	1
Good grippy picks for some types of playing . I go back and forth between these and the Jazz IIIs when I 'm in a Jazz pick kind of mood ( i.e . : when I 'm not using ginormous Gypsy Jazz picks or Fender heavies . I especially dig Davas ( all models ) for acoustic playing and strumming . Nice tone as well . Have tried pretty much every Dava and each has its pluses for specific kinds of playing.One thing about Davas is that once in a while the pick will slightly move in my grip , and I 'll pick the string with the rubber . Hand angle can also play a part in this . Probably just me .	1
This microphone works well for our needs . I purchased refurbished so , when I received the microphone , the mic piece is actually removed from the handle . It could be from shipping . I re-attached the item and added a windscreen . Now , my kids play around with it and the microphone never detached anymore .	1
awesome , it does the job perfectly , now my vocals sound way better and clearer . this filter is awesome and for the price ca n't get any better .	1
I have been trying to find the perfect gauge and this is it . Tried 40-100 ( too light and high ) and 50-110 ( too deep , not good for popping ) , but is right in the middle . Perfect .	1
Exactly what I expected . A quality tuner for a low price . Very durable and gets the job done . Great buy !	1
i bought this cable in an emergency situation - one where I was on the road , needed a great cable , and did n't have access to roll my own using , what would 've been , essentially the same parts . I exclusively use canare and mogami in the studio , and in critical places of my live setup . The cable itself is top shelf , quiet , and will provide years of use if you treat it even with modest respect . As an instrument cable , this could possibly be a little short if you move around a bunch , making it worth it to go for the 18 ' cable as a bass or guitar player if you do n't like being tied down . I used this as part of a keyboard rig , where it was perfect on all levels - quality reproduction of sound across the entire spectrum ( the highs were crystal , the bass clear ) , connection is solid ( I am not a gold fanatic , but these are excellent ) , great warranty , and a reputation that holds value . ( These are real deal pro cables , as opposed to some cables priced similarly that have a monster price , but not necessarily a superior build or sound , which is why I did n't walk into guitar center and buy a pair of monster 1000 's and waited for these to be delivered overnight instead , , , )	1
I 've been using D'Addario XL nickel wounds on my P-Bass for a long time . They have a lot of tone , they seem to last a long time , and they 're not very expensive . These strings have the same feel as the nickel wounds , but are a lot brighter You get lots of overtones and high end from these . The choice of gauges is a little different from the regular XLs , too ; instead of the .085 A and the .100 E they have a .085 A and a .105 E. That 's just enough to give you a slightly more solid low end , and more metal to dig into , while retaining low tension in the D and G. I 'm more of an old-school player and prefer nickel for that mellower sound , but if you 're into funk or more modern sounds , you may feel that the bright SS sound is for you , and if so , these are a great string .	1
I purchased this rack last year to hold my outboard recording gear . I liked the fact that it was open in the back so I could patch things in and out easily before I bought a patch bay . I find it very sturdy and well made , and I 've loaded it almost completely full . I do recommend placing the heavier units towards the bottom .	1
Keeps gear dry.Not for airplane travel or shipping , but perfect for spare guitars.Zipper works fine ; fabric as good as gig bags three times as much .	1
I needed a nice sounding classical guitar for dinner gigs . I went to the large Guitar store and tried out several in this price range and couple hundred above and settled on this one because of the sweet sound and workmanship . For the money I do n't think it can be beat . Mahogany not plywood sides and back and Cedar top make for a really nice mellow tone and a bone nut and saddle thrown in for good measure . Bone does make a considerable difference I have found . All the finish is excellent . Now for some down sides . Yes the frets were not finished up to par on the ends . As for leveling it seemed OK . So I took some time and masked off the fret board and finished the frets flush with the fingerboard and rounded the sides and tops . Cedar will scratch and nick just looking at it . You can make your own clear plastic pick guards to any size by going to Wal Mart and in the material sewing department you will find clear plastic in large rolls . You can buy a half yard long x 54 '' and make enough pick guards to last a life time for a couple bucks . It clings to the gloss finish nicely . ( Do not use this on old guitars with Nitro finish it will eat the finish instantly ) Same goes when changing strings . Put some masking tape at the end of the bridge on the top to prevent the strings from scratching the Cedar top . Overall like one reviewer said this guitar is hard to put down . I put a Baggs I-Beam pickup in it also . Easy installation and nice natural sound . It is nice as it does not have a big EQ cut into the side of the body .	1
This polish cloth is cheap and does the job of wiping your guitar down from dust or from use with cleaning products . It does n't scratch the guitar and works great !	1
You know , if you do guitar work , you need a neck stand . Some sheets+stand units cost $ 50 . This was what I needed and it was cheap . So far so good .	1
It does take a little getting used to the programming aspect , but this little pedal is amazing . I must have 20 different pedals , and I 'm always torn which ones ones to bring to practice . With this pedal , it 's easy ... just grab and go . Are all the sounds perfect or as good as individual analog pedals ? Probably not . But they do the job just fine . The thing I love the most , and this may be a little anal , but I 've actually preset individual settings for each song I play with my band . That way I can shuffle through the presets with one stomp . Some have two pedal effects , some have 6 ! If this broke or wore out for whatever reason , I would go right out and buy another one for sure . Best $ 100 I 've spent on gear .	1
Great foot switch that is easy to use . I figured out that the whole body lifts up to expose the battery compartment . Wish they had put that in some instructions . If it 's there I missed it .	1
As I am one of those `` forever beginners '' when it comes to playing a guitar I may not be able to tell you all that this capo does . The reason I ordered it is to hold my strings so I can set my guitar . I may play around with it to see what all it does.Good price , just as described !	1
I own a number of guitar hangers . This one was a good buy for the money . I have wood ones that are heavier and more attractive , but also a good deal pricier . For what I spent for this one , it is adequate as long as it & # 34 ; holds Up & # 34 ; ( Pun intended )	1
If you play a lot you have to install these on all your guitars and straps . Easy to use and very secure . No fear of the strap coming loose and having your guitar drop to the floor .	1
I cant play real guitars ... ... . but i did buy this for Rock Band . This is perfect with the boom i can sing and play without the stand getting in the way . This has so many adjustment spots no one will have a problem getting a good position with it . I even use it when im drumming . I highly recommend this for real players or even plastic players . Well this one is actually better than most of the ones my wifes band has . Oh its almost impossible to knock down too , believe me the cats have tried .	1
This thing is a TANK ! I do n't think you could break this beast if you wanted to ! The last string winder you will ever buy !	1
This is really quite a fantastic little gizmo . It functions flawlessly and makes tuning my guitar quick , simple , and fun . It is easy to read from any angle ( it adjusts every which way ) . You just clamp it onto your guitar and it picks up the vibrations , showing you when you are sharp , flat , or dead on . Quite amazing , especially for the price . Highly recommend ( and I 'm stingy with my 5 star reviews )	1
Using this as a line from my amp to a single pedal . Works great , no noise . Well made cable with bullet-proof molded TS protection . The cable is slightly on the thin side , but it functions well . Without a doubt , a very sturdy cable .	1
Still a great product it 's just a little flimsy . The way the bottom holder attaches to the base is the problem ! It does n't attach ! It just slides in and then you kinda just hope it does n't bend or break . The only problem is if you are clumsy like me you might push your guitar down into it a little to hard and damage it .	1
What can you say about the best of the best . I would n't use anything else on my guitar to get the best tonal quality from it . These strings seem to last longer than the others I 've used . I highly recommend them .	1
I have been trying to find a good vibrato pedal for a long time . I have bought $ 150 pedals and $ 100 pedals and I got this one for $ 25 and it blows all the others out of the water . The only down side to this pedal is that you either need to run it off a 9volt or the Behringer power supply . I could n't get it to work properly with my pedalboard power or my Pyle-Pro PPDLP02 DC supply . The plastic case feels like it may break at anytime but aside from that I love this pedal more than a puppy playing a harp in the middle of a daisy field in Michigan .	1
Grips the neck well and keeps the strings immobile even when strumming real hard . Feels a little awkward trying to put the capo on with one hand , but I guess that 's how all of them are . Works very well on acoustic guitars	1
I 've been playing with this a lot since I got it last week . It really is versatile as well as noiseless . I 've mostly used it with the default settings.I have n't had the time to tweak it as much as I 'd like but I can say that it is quite easy to get different tones from it . Really impressed with this wah !	1
I lose picks so easily I needed a pick hold . This one sticks well to the guitar . Locating a spot for it depends on you and your guitar . Unless you keep it full of picks it will rattle . So I push one or two extra picks partly in the holder to stop it . I might try it somewhere on the strap .	1
I bought this cable long with my epiphone les paul special II and the Fender Mini Tone Master thinking that either one did not come with a cable . The epiphone came with a cable which ceased functioning after a couple days . The curly cable has fared much better . No problems , works great and does n't tangle so it stores easily too.Great as a primary or backup cable . Buy one , it 's cheap !	1
If you 'd ever been setting up on stage and discover hum or hiss this box is for you . It will find a bad or intermittent calbe in a heart beat . It will locate a shorted XLR or an open ground fast . Do n't go onto the stage without one on these boxes .	1
Nic epiece of cloth to wipe my strings and it looks cool with fender on it . happy buyer Thank you very much	1
All of the PD/DW products I 've bought have been amazing ( from stands , to thrones , etc ) . This stand is an amazing value and provides a lot of flexibility when mounting your cymbals . Solid too .	1
I put two pickups in my resonator guitar , a magnetic and a transducer . This is the IMD -- improvised musical device -- solution to using both pickups without building a little box with two volume controls . I plug two cords into the mixer , one from each pickup , and blend and balance the two pickups . It works . It cost a a little more than buying the parts to build something like an electric guitar wiring setup but it works out of the box so the labor cost is almost zero . Bonus , it 's an active device so it can boost the signal . Only con is that it runs on 12 V and does n't have a battery option . I can live with that .	1
Good quality . Adjustable and does not get in the way , Great improvement over spring capos . Not much more to say but need five more words to post	1
First of all as a former touring guitarist and a guitar tech junkie , I have a tool box with every tool you can imagine . I have to say this string cleaner is a must have ! I say this because in the long run , it will save you money on strings , save you time with changes , and will keep your strings sounding alive.Most guitarists do n't realize just what they are doing to their strings when they play . You are leaving behind a world of sweat , dead skin , and all kinds of nasty elements . The oils/fluids you leave behind can be very acidic and contain plenty of things that will build up and corrode your strings . I 've seen people who change strings every week because the strings keep going dead . I 've seen mold and and all kinds of garbage build up on strings so bad I thought a sloth may be living on it . This little tool will prevent that.I have a routine with mine . Before I play , I run the cleaner over the strings a few times . Whenever I 'm done playing I make sure to spray a string cleaner fluid onto the pad and run it over the strings again until I feel they are completely clean . You will not believe the extension of your string life or the quality of sound you will get following these cleaning practices.Someone has mentioned in their review the fret damage that the string cleaner caused and I too thought about that the first time I used it . I suggest pulling up a little bit so that the cleaner does not touch the frets . Toward the nut where it is hard to get the cleaner in , I just wipe down with a rag . This is a great , cheap , handy little product that all guitarists should keep in their pockets .	1
I drop my pics on purpose now just so I can use it more often ! It does what it 's supposed to do , what else can I say .	1
I got the aged white . I was changing out pups for a more vintage sound . This kit was cheaper to buy then all the parts one by one . I have a MIM 2012 Strat , every thing went together with out any issues . Best price online and the shipping was super fast . I back plate is the mint green , but looks awesome on the guitar .	1
I was afraid poor quality would come with the low price , but I did an AB comparison with one of my expensive oxygen free , yada , cables and I could not tell a difference . I was playing an American made guitar through an American made tube amp so this was a legit sound test . I 'm sure the plastic on the ends of the plugs will not last as long as a more expensive cable ... but who cares ... buy a new one ! Love the coil , love the price .	1
This pedal is awesome . Not only does the DD-7 offer standard dealy and echo it also has reverse delay , modulation , and loop functions . It 's capable of looping up to 40 seconds of play which is a wonderful tool for writing two and three part harmonies or working out timing . This pedal is amazing and I highly recomend it for any guitar player . Most of my pedals are Boss because they only build their equipment to industrial strength and standards . This means their stuff is made to last . No flimsy plastics , cheap rubber , or faulty components or parts will cut it in Boss 's supieror product line .	1
This guitar strap is wide and well made of good quality leather.Just what I needed.I am very happy with it and thank you . Rich B .	1
Elixir coated strings were by far my favorite strings for my acoustic guitar . D'Addario has finally made a string that is comparable to and maybe a little tiny bit better than the Elixir's.These are very nice bright strings . The coating is incredibly subtle , almost impossible to feel on the strings . I like that . Compared to Elixir 's these are a bit brighter , with good feel.Call me old school , I hate the packaging . These strings are packaged in three two string loops inside a single plastic bag . Ah , you know I 'm just so used to strings that are individually looped . Two strings looped together makes a mess while I 'm restringing a guitar - when I unwrap that pair , I 've got a string that has to sit out unwrapped on the bench . The neat freak in me hates that . I also dislike that the strings are in one plastic bag . Yeah I get it ; they are trying to be more environmentally responsible . But darn it , 6 paper envelopes ? It feels to me like they are just trying to cheapen up the packaging materials , not some environmental cause . 100 % post-consumer recycled paper adds very little to the environmental load.I know D'Addario loves the color coded ends . On my acoustic guitar that 's irrelevant , the ends are hidden inside the guitar behind the pegs . On my electric guitars , I do n't like the look at all . I prefer gold or silver rings at the end . If the strings are in individual labeled packages , there 's no need for the colors.D'Addario loves the color coded end rings so much , they do a horrible job color coding and simplifying their packaging . I have yet to decode their colors or naming system.I normally use 10 gauge strings in my acoustic guitar . I tested these at 12 gauge and am surprised how much I like them . The slightly thicker string is not bad.Oddly these strings are priced almost the same as Elixir 's . My reason for using the original D'Addario strings is low price - if somebody is doing gigs nightly , those uncoated strings are the only way to go . Strings end up being changed long before corrosion becomes an issue for the gigging musician . For the home enthusiast , coated strings make a ton of sense , they do last longer . I think they are worth the premium price . Now there are two choices for excellent coated strings.In the end , the packaging , the color coded end rings , the crazy package coding , and the double looped strings all mean nothing once the strings are on the guitar . What they sound like and play like is the most important thing . And in that regard these are excellent strings .	1
I have a Electric Bass Guitar and needed to Capo . After looking at & # 34 ; reviews & # 34 ; I like this one the best . I 'm very happy with it and it works great without any problems . The size is & # 34 ; Just Right & # 34 ; , not too small or Big ...	1
Good cable works for me , using it in a rhythmtrak foot switch . Just the right length . May order more as extra 's .	1
Purchased this Snark tuner after reading a few positive reviews and decided to give it a try . For the money I figured why not.GREAT little tuner . Dead on accuracy and perfect for tuning in rooms where you may have noise interference using regular tuners . This clips to the headstock and is very easy to use.The face pivots around and the display is nice and bright . I will pick up a few more and toss em in my guitar cases !	1
It does what it is suppose to , cut vibration and well I might add . Much better than a standard clip on a mic . This one is not going to break if you take the mic on and off , since it 's rubber . If it does break , has a lifetime warranty . Had a Shure SM58 on a table , on a stand in this clip , pounded on the table , only picked up the tap sound my hand has making , and no sub harmonics vibrating though the table . Moved the mic off axis , pounded again , absolutely no noise . Ca n't ask for more than that .	1
Works as well as my friend 's condenser mic that cost him three times as much . Great mic for the price .	1
This is my second 4 way switch and it wo n't be the last . The four way gives you an added combination of neck and bridge in series , which gives a fatter tone than position 2 and more output than positions 1,2 , or 3 . I am very pleased with the & # 34 ; new sound & # 34 ; of my tele . The wiring diagram is very easy to understand and the install is pretty easy if you have a soldering gun . ( do n't forget to lay down some newspaper to protect your guitar finish from solder ) .	1
It does n't seem to be loud enough for a recording device that I have , but other than that , it works as described .	1
I have preferred Ernie Ball Extra Lights which is a nickel string . They have a smooth depth of tone which is my preference . The NYXL 's have a brighter tone , good playing ease , and stay in tune better when making new string changes . If you have a mahogany body guitar such as the Les Paul junior specials then the added top end would make a very nice match , or if you like a brighter tone on any guitar the same applies.These are not coated strings which a lot of strings in this price range are . Pertaining to output I am a firm believer that although you can notice a difference quite readily between certain types of stings in & # 34 ; acoustic/unamplified & # 34 ; output , but once you plug them into an amp with a volume knob the difference disappears.These do stay in tune better than my usual Ernie Balls nickels when you first put them on . The nickel takes a day to stretch into the tension of proper pitch . These have their tension adjust better on the first day of use . After the nickels set in you may not notice much of a difference . I find that by lightly sanding the nut with 1000 grit paper , and using Big Ben 's Nut Sauce on all of the contact points of the string does more for keeping a guitar in tune than any other . Having these NYXL 's on there is just one more added benefit.I would say if you are looking for a brighter tone , with better tuning stability , these are the ones to have . You can tell from the wall to wall 5 star reviews these are the one to have .	1
I have about quit using picks now . But I needed a variety pack to try different thicknesses . That 's what you get with this . From very thin and flexible to 0.8 and hard , you get a selection .	1
Works great , just what I needed to have to walk all over the room . Now I sit in my chair	1
Unless you 're going to get a very expensive professional chord this is just as good as any other and works great for medium sized venues .	1
This straplock set does n't come with any instructions , that 's because it 's so easy you do n't need them ! Took the original screws off my Fender Strat , set the button , screws and felt washer together and quickly screwed it in . Afterwards screwed the lock into myGibson Lightning Bolt Style 2 Inch Safety Guitar Strap , Jet Blackwithout any problem whatsoever and it was ready ! It is a quite simple mechanism but it shows that the button and lock wo n't come loose by accident by any chance . Still have n't given it a real gig test but by hanging it for a couple minutes I can tell I made the right purchase . Way recommended !	1
It works as a pop filter should and is a huge upgrade over my make-shift panty hose pop filter . What else is there to say ?	1
I 've been using these strings on my guitars for the last 30+ years . They always give me consistent results . I consider them one of the greatest bargains out there .	1
About ten years ago , I installed strap locks on my first guitar ( Fender Stratocaster ) . They worked well and were easy to install . I subsequently installed Dunlop strap locks on many other guitars with mixed results : the screws are really small and they would some times get stuck in the middle of installation . I had to drill additional holes no two guitars ( Gibson SGs ) . Ouch.This made me take a second look at Schaller . The components , beginning with the screws , are of much higher quality than Dunlop . It took me ten years to realize that I made the wrong choice . I should have gone with Schaller from the beginning . I have replaced all my strap locks with Schaller with excellent results .	1
nice and fine product working for many hours with no degradation of the sound , no too much heat and easy plug for instant job	1
Great tone and tuning stability . Was a direct drop in for my epi wildkat . Really helped with the bigsby tuning stability	1
I used this strap for the first time during a rehearsal last night . I typically practice sitting down without a strap when I am alone , but stand up when rehearsing or performing with a band . I had previously used a very expensive 2 '' padded leather cradle type strap , which I really liked . I sold that banjo and the strap with it , but recently re-acquired another banjo and wanted a good strap , but was not willing to pay the $ 80 again for a premium padded leather strap . I saw all of the great reviews for this strap and the affordable price and took a chance . I am glad I did.This strap may not be as elegant as fine leather , but it is made extremely well and feels very durable and substantial in its construction . What blew me away is that my full tone ring banjo , which weighs about 14 pounds , literally felt half as heavy . It is no joke . At first , the feeling was unnerving , because the strap has some elastic give to it . You get this dual sensation of a ) the banjo feeling super light and b ) as if the banjo is going to sink to the floor . Paradoxical I know , but that 's where the magic of this strap is . It is almost as if the banjo is floating in front of you , but in reality it remains very stable when playing.Like I said , the build quality is outstanding . My only critique of the design is that it is very modern and non-traditional , so you also have to get used to the contrast of a traditional instrument , like a 5-string bluegrass banjo and the newer style and design of this strap.This is not just a good strap for the money rather it is a great strap at any price point . I think I might try these on my electrics ( though I already have literally hundreds of dollars invested in a stable of those high end padded leather straps ) .	1
I am using it to record my garage band 's demo to get us more gigs . I have been a gigging musician for over 20 years . Had it a few days and with in a half hour after opening it , I had two guitar tracks , a bass track , and drums tracks ( from garageband ) all laid down . Easy to plug in , I am using it with a MacBookPro and garageband . Very quality recordings so far . Like it so far.Edit- Put down some vocals with a cheap shure mic ( pg-48 ) used fx from garageband and got a nice vocal track , easy to layer over harmonies . Still have yet to mic up a drum kit ... Still enjoying the product , still amazed at the ease of use . Did try to install software on a PC with Vista , no luck.Edit - Mic 'd up a drum kit into a mixer , lined it out to this interface , I then mixed the drum mics with the mixer . You can record the drums as a single track so once they 're recorded you can not mix them individually ( ie . snare , kick and so on ) . I do get very quality recordings with it set up this way . I am sure a recording engineer could give me better ideas on how to get more out of it , but as for now , I am very pleased .	1
This is just an excellent product . I have been using this product on my guitars for over a year now and as long as they keep making it , I will keep using it . You only need a very little bit to polish the entire guitar and you do n't need to use it for every polish . Once you put it on initially , you can simply buff your guitar with a dry cloth for the next two or three cleanings and the shine comes right back . There is enough in one bottle to last a very long time.I highly recommend this product and would like to also refer you to the Dunlop 65 lemon oil for cleaning your fretboards . The lemon oil very quickly removes any residue and shines the fretboard up extremely well . When it dries , your fretboard is beautiful and very smooth for all your bending and sliding tricks . 50 stars .	1
Sounds ok on its own , not very loud or good quality at any high volume , but then when you plug in some good headphones , AWESOME ! Great gain , tone , high volume , sounds awesome , perfect to use as a headphone amplifier with some play and effect . Great sound , awesome deal . Score ! : D	1
As stated , I use the D'Addario 9s and 10s on all my electric guitars except for theGibson LP 's and I use Brite wires on those.I like the D'Addario 's over the Brite wires because they have color coded balls and thismakes changing out all the strings at once a lot easier.I do not produce a lot of body acid , so strings last a very long time with me , no matterwho the manufacturer is , and I play many guitars in my collection so none of them gets heavyuse.The EXL strings produce great tone , and are great for bending .	1
Perfect chain for most rock sounds.Get the 28 strand for a thicker snap.I might try out the 28strand next year . I 'm pretty happy with this one right now.The place I live in has corrosive air though its not messed these chains .	1
After reading many review on my Yamaha 700 acoustic guitar I have owned and played for 4 months , I finally took the advice of other consumers . MANY people suggested changing the stock plastic nut and bridge saddle to improve tone.This guitar is an incredible deal and piece the way it was . I did put a light set of D'addario strings that made a world of difference.I was due for another string change so upgraded with this set of bone nut and saddle.WOW , it really did make a huge difference . This guitar is such a quality piece , especially for the money . But , with the string and bone upgrades I ca n't imagine a sweeter sounding acoustic . It changed the tone to that of a classical guitar . I am so happy with my changes.The high notes are pure and ring nicely and lows are rich and deep . The sustain is a drastic improvement , each note lasting nicely into the next . I am so pleased and excited with my guitar.If you own this or any other acoustic with plastic nut and saddle ... ..change them , it 's a very quick fix . And find a nice set of strings .	1
As a pro musician , I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations . I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board , I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G & L ; American Legacy ( Stratocaster style guitar ) more sustain at lower volumes . Boss is the company that dominates my effects board ... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner , Digital Delay ( 2 of them ) , Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night ( for gig & Practice ) .With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really , really like this unit . It did what I wanted & then some ! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the `` On '' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars , especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own .	1
Got a new tenor uke and could n't resist putting my fav strings on it . Replaced GHS strings . So far , so good .	1
Really just some inexpensive and yet durable cables to link your stompboxes together . As of yet , i havent had one go all crackly , which , considering they get frequent use , is pretty good . Often , cheap cords die within a year or so . Every electric guitarist keeps a stock of these things , and this one in particular is cheap and accessible . I probably have around twelve of them.Enjoy !	1
I started playing and writing a few songs that were specifically designed to get the sound that comes from a capo higher on the neck.I found that I needed to have a couple of exta capos hanging around and so bought this and the G7th . Both are very good . I did notice that if I had a wider neck ( I think i am 42.5 mm at the nut on my two Takamines ) the may be a bit short . They work and are cool looking . I have aa adjustable Planet Waves that also works great . Cheaper ones also work	1
My favorite brand of strings right now . 8 guitars now are fitted . They bend easy , last longer , feel smoother and a shot of Finger Grease Spray just adds the icing to the cake	1
Brass Tacks : They are Velour . They fit on the ATH-M50 headphones . That is what I wanted.They are not a perfect fit , as they are MEANT for a slightly larger can , but it 's more than snug . Looks good too ! ( Remember : Because of the material , you WILL notice a slight difference in sound . )	1
If you 're like me , you probably bought this to hook up an XLR microphone to a digital recorder or a PC.It works fine for the handy type recorders.But forget hooking this directly to a PC . Way too much noise .	1
This sure wipes down any guitar to get finger prints and such off . Remember , I would not use this with any kind of polish , a little pricey , but then again , are n't our toys !	1
This is the best cleaning product I 've ever used . Not only do I use it on my maple and rosewood fretboards , but I also use it on the headstock if it 's unfinished and on the unfinished body of my Ukulele . What it does is it restores the wood in a way that it gives it a much more brilliant , beautiful and lively tone . Really brings out the beauty of true wood . Now every fretboard and unfinished bit of wood on my guitars looks beautiful and brand new . Application method is also very useful . I do n't know why there is a strict warning saying not to use it on maple fretboards ; I put it on my Stratocaster 's maple fretboard and it looks beautiful . The only thing it did differently was it made the fretboard a good shade darker . I also must add that the stuff has a very wonderful lemony smell ( nowhere near overpowering ) , and it does clean off a lot of dirt in conjunction to hydrating and livening the wood . Great stuff . Go ahead and buy it .	1
I have one of these in every one of my cases . It 's a plastic sponge holder with holes in it ; nothing special but it does the job .	1
It works well 95 % of the time but sometimes has a problem with the G string for me . I use it in tandem with a snark tuner and together they 're fail safe . ( the snark tuner will also get buggy once in a while but together it 's so statistically unlikely that I do n't worry about it ) The stomp tuner also has the benefit of being able to hault the signal , hence why I would n't just use a snark tuner .	1
This instrument might actually be in a class of its own . That is , it would be extremely difficult to find a guitar in this price band that comes even remotely close in terms of quality ; not only with regard to craftsmanship , but certainly the sound it produces . The Applause exceeds expectation whether it is unplugged , amplified , or even run directly through a mixer . Beyond sounding comparatively spectacular , it is far more durable than perhaps any other hollow-bodied instrument on the market due to its components and design . The electronics are reliable and the instrument is accessible , or playable , to even the most novice of musicians . This guitar is the ideal instrument for a beginner or a younger musician , simply because it is cost efficient , durable , and as easy to play for the price as one might be able to find anywhere . Even experienced guitarists will almost certainly appreciate its action , sound and durability if not only for the purposes of practice and travel . This is an exceptional value and an excellent instrument .	1
I needed a couple of extra boom stands instead of a regular stand for a couple of my cymbalsand set these up and I am pretty happy with them.. They could have been a litte taller , howeverthere pretty good duty and do a good job for the money . You could do better however you willpay quite a bit extra . I would buy more if I needed them .	1
If you listen or read what many pro guitarists and techies have to say about DigiTech effects pedals , they 'll tell you to stay away from them ... except for this one . That 's because the DigiTech Bad Monkey Tube Overdrive is an incredible value that could go head to head with any pedal made by BOSS or the $ 100 TS-9 Tubescreamer.In fact the TS-9 Tubescreamer is the pedal the Bad Monkey is best compared to . This is not meant to be a heavy distortion pedal with endless game - it simulates and overloaded tube amp that adds crunch and a little gain to an otherwise clean tone . Notes will sing and chords will really crunch , especially in blues and classic rock . But since the pedal works well as a level/gain boost , I 've heard of guitarists turning on the Bad Monkey in conjunction with other distortion effects , to really push them to new levels.But the best feature of the Bad Monkey by far is the two-band EQ . Virtually any distortion pedal has a `` Tone '' control that will make the tone darker or brighter . But since one band EQ basically takes away bass to add treble ( or vice versa ) , you may not find the sound you want . That 's what 's so great about the Bad Monkey - if you feel like your tone is too weak , you can fatten it up . If it 's too muddy , you can add treble . And you can make those changes without compromising the parts of the tone that you like.Construction is extremely durable - die cast metal , and probably heavier than a BOSS pedal . The switch is more similar to a BOSS than an Ibanez pedal , but I find that easier to use.If you 're a beginning player or a player on a budget , this would be an outstanding pedal to own , along with a more traditional high gain distortion pedal . There 's really no need to spend the extra money on a Tubescreamer , if that will prevent you from buying something else you need for your gear . But even for player where money is not an object , do n't overlook the Bad Monkey . It might just be the only tube overdrive pedal you 'll need .	1
This thing works great ! I play out live in clubs and this device is indispensable . Accurate and quick - great for between song quick tuning.It 's a Boss pedal - so it is rugged and reliable.I have seen this pedal on the pedal boards of top touring pros , recording artists and session musicians in and around the Dallas and North Texas area . I play locally and regionally in North Texas and see this pedal on almost EVERY guitarist and bassist 's boards every night.Great product - well made - worth every penny . ** UPDATE **After using this tuner for a month I can say that I made the right decision.Fantastic product that every guitar player needs - period . ** ** ** ** ** ** *EDIT 10-23-2012I have purchased another one of these tuners for an alternate pedal board.These really are the best tuners out there - you should get one today ! There is no comparison to anything else out there - nothing - I have looked !	1
i got pink cause nobody would steal it , and we all know how often capos get stolen from people pink is great	1
This tuner works great . I put in a 9 volt battery a couple of months ago and it still is going strong . It will take a 9 volt output from my power supply and I can then piggyback to another pedal , which is great . It is very , very accurate and does not get confused under normal conditions . You do need to hit only one string at a time , however . Size is perfect for a pedalboard small but still quite readable . Price is very good . I had a Boss in the past but took it back because it just seemed so overpriced and too complicated .	1
I can put 5 electric guitars in gig bags on this stand . It is solid and no problems with itafter 6 months use . Assembly was pretty easy and took little time .	1
I buy these for my son . He loves the grip on them as they help stop them from slipping out of his hands . He also likes the small size . They last forever and do n't break .	1
I got this cable to run to my electronic drum set at the other end of the studio as a previous cable failed on me . The balanced lead works well and the cable is very quiet . Construction features too well soldered TRS 1/4 & # 34 ; male connections and the only downside I can complain about is the lack of strain relief ... but nothing major and the cables work fine none the less .	1
got this to treat my fretboard on my guitar . Nice airline-sized bottle w/ safety cap to prevent from unintentional opening . Replenished my dried out fretboard to like-new condition .	1
It 's easy to use and is definitely needed for a new string musician . Good quality and ensures you are playing the chords correctly .	1
At about twice the price of their standard strings , These D'Addario NYXL strings make lots of enticing claims about tuning stability , higher breaking point , and something called & # 34 ; fusion twist & # 34 ; ( which I swear is a rare Chubby Checker B-side ) .Having just put a set of these on one of my guitars , I ca n't speak to any of the claims of superiority over other strings , but I can say they are solid , dependable strings with lots of & # 34 ; punch and crunch & # 34 ; .	1
Great value . Works well , tunes tight and is CHEAP . When the battery is run down , the screen darkens but it still works . What more is there to say .	1
Bought a couple of these as replacement tubes for my bass amp , and I think they improved the sound over the original EH ones . These are considered `` boutique tubes '' , but I think they 're popular for a reason .	1
There 's not much to say about this product , except that it works . It makes my strings last longer . Sometimes I get lazy owning so many guitars , and 20 minutes per & # 34 ; well done & # 34 ; restring adds up . This is a great way to put that off and keep jamming for as long as possible . It 's small and conveniently stored too . I recommend trying it out !	1
I used this to tune a coconut thumb piano . If it can tune that , it should handle your guitar or bass FINE . Was really impressed to see it in action . NOT THE SMOOTHEST operation in the world but it 's gig-bag small and accurate .	1
i been using these for over thirty years and they have always served me well.I like 11s because for me it has a nice balance between strong steady sounding power chords while the top end is slinky enough to play leads hence the Power Slinky name .	1
My father is a full-time gigging musician primarily on Steel Guitar and Telecaster . He has been playing over 50 years and it takes a lot to get him interested in new strings . We both use D'Addario strings almost exclusively ( myself on bass guitar , and him on the electric ) . These are *outstanding* strings with great durability , playability and exceptional sound . They remain in tune for long gigs or recording sessions , they generate less fret noise than comparable strings and have a bright/crisp sound that really stands out . Well worth the extra investment . Highly recommended !	1
I recently received my multi plug cable ( daisy chain ) for use with my guitar pedals and I am very pleased with one spots , product . I can tell it is a built to last cable with eight plugs spaced out enough to allow me to put my pedals where I like them . It plugged into my Behringer 9 volt power adapter nicely . Its so nice to not to have to replace 9 volt batteries every week . A real money saver in the long run . Buy this cable .	1
I just ordered three different guitar straps online . One for my daughter and at first a cheap one for myself . Then I found this and decided to get it . The $ 5 strap worked fine but it was scratchy and stiff . I got this and switched over . Ahhh this is a guitar strap ! I see why you pay more . It is so soft and comfortable . It looks AMAZING ! This is just a great product . I would highly recommend it to anyone and am proud to use it on my guitar . Thanks !	1
I was looking for a cheap way to get some drums miced up in a hurry for this Saturday 's St. Patrick 's Day parade . I took a chance on this kit , even though I have never purchased anything that says `` Pyle '' on the label . Upon receiving this kit , my first surprise was the quality of the case , and then upon opening , I was surpised to find that these were the EXACT same microphones as the ones I borrowed once from a friend to do some recordings , but branded differently . He paid about 350-400 for his kit ( still cheap by today 's standards ) .I pulled out 1 overhead condensor and the kick-drum mic and mounted them , fired up the PA and had our drummer play a bit and was shocked at the clarity of the overhead mic ! We could probably get away with just using this one microphone to mic the entire kit , or two overheads ; they pick up everything very clearly . I turned up the volume on the kick-drum mic and was even more surprised to hear the thump of a much more expensive mic coming out of this seemingly too-small mic . Now , I have a wonderful drum mix coming from only 2 microphones and my mixer has more channels free than I would have expected . For fun , I added one of the tom/snare mics and they sounded equally clear.After purchasing this , I can tell you that there is absolutely NO way I would purchase one of the `` high-end '' drum-mic kits . If you are looking for a solution for recording or live sound , this is it . I promise you will LOVE the sound and you will be ecstatic about the price you paid to get that sound .	1
A very nice pick , both in feel and texture ( the design is a bit boring , though ) . Only complaint is that it 's fairly small - about the size of a Canadian or US five cent piece , where most of your typical guitar pick are bigger - about the size of a 25 cent piece . But that 's okay . I got this the same time as I got a set of Dava Jazz Grip 9024 red picks and the Dunlop Max Grip Jazz III Carbon Fiber Guitar Picks , and I think I like the Dava picks the best . All three are & # 34 ; tight grip & # 34 ; picks , and all the same size - they 're all good , though - I 'd rate this one next-best , and the Jazz III Carbon Fiber next after that ) .	1
This bag is light , with two back pack straps , a pocket for accessories , excellent quality material and a good quality zipper . If you just need something lightweight to protect your instrument this is it .	1
I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were . Finally I just went with this one and I 'm pretty happy with it . It seems quite servicable . It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough . The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just do n't bump it . I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it . I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly ( not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles ) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then , I 'm gon na keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost .	1
If you need it , good unobtrusive device for front or as a momentary back strap . Leather or simulated , this was quite adequate for my purposes . Price was right ! Delivery was immediate . Rolls up to fit in gig bag and no doubt would adequately go into the hard case . This one is compatible with the finish on my instrument , since it comes in at least two distinct color tones.Planet Waves Mandolin Strap , Brown . Also comes in Black . There is also an embossed model ( Brown ) offered at minimumly higher price .	1
My old pair of JBL Studio Pro computer monitors finally gave up the ghost . At the time , mid 1990 's , these were the best you could expect for computer monitors . I do mixing and voice overs , so I needed the real deal . After extensive research and listening , I decided on the M-Audio BX5a deluxe . For the price they can not be beat ! Punchy crisp bass , smooth highs and great mid range . They are also very accurate , I hear things just the way they are recorded . They also bring to light subtleties in old CD 's that I have never heard before ! Also the wood construction , gives these speakers a warmer resonance than others made out of plastic or metal . If you have a studio on a budget , and need the best speakers for under $ 500.00 , buy these . Remember , they are studio monitors , so the audio is going to be very directional , so use them for monitors . Great speakers for portables , like an Ipod . One note , you need a really good sound card to get the most from these babies !	1
I liked the fact i can insert more than 5 picks and they really stand tight and do n't fall down . But the original glue was not string enought and the holder has fallen on the ground .	1
These are n't my first set , I ca n't count the amount of Monster 1/4 cables I bought and own . None has ever failed me so far . Highly recommend these !	1
This guitar stand does NOT find hidden treasure . It does NOT hypnotize beautiful women . It does NOT fix your transmission . It does NOT tell your boss to give you a raise.It just holds onto your guitar when you do n't see any reason to put into a case . It 's sturdy , reliable and to the point . No gimmicks , nothing flashy . Just a guitar stand that is reasonably priced . If you need one , might as well be this one .	1
This is an amazing pedal . delay , flanger , phaser , tremolo , pitch shifter . All sound really good and completely adjustable . Only downfall is that you can only use a single function at any one time . For the price this is a steal . Behringer Rocks .	1
Great for linking close-quarter effect pedals . No noise and very durable . Great product for the price . I would recommend buying .	1
Not only is this a quality guitar stand that is adjustable it is really affordable to and it has a safety strap for the top of the neck of your guitar that will keep ur guitar from falling forward this is a great buy !	1
Excellent guitar strings - they last a long time , sound great and are pretty cheap .	1
I like this volume pedal because you can beat on it and drop it and kick it and misuse the hell out of it and it still works . Why that 's overly important in a volume pedal I 'm not sure but this one is built like a tank and can stand the beating of regular gigging . It takes up a huge footprint on a board so I generally run it at the end of the chain and to the side but the large footprint allows for getting your whole shoe/boot on the thing and that is comforting while playing . Overall the pedal has a good throw or travel to it and does n't suck the tone like other volume pedals . Good buy-	1
I like the sound of this pedal . It gives my ss Fender Princeton chorus a good tubelike sound . I have 2 all tube amps but they are both heavy . I prefer taking the fender ss on smaller gigs . The TO800 gives me the sound I like without breaking the bank . I have n't used batteries in it because I use a 1 spot adapter on all the pedals on my pedalboard . If you'rethinking you want this and are on a tight budget go ahead and pull the trigger . You wo n't be sorry .	1
I have a hard time paying for a patch cable that costs almost as much as a 20 ' cable . These are not cheap but they are priced much better than others . And they Work Great ! No loss of Tone through these cables . If anything I had to do some EQ adjusting because after using these I had a far greater signal ( volume and frequency response ) when I replaced my other patch cables with these ! I Love Them ! ! !	1
Nice picks with very tasteful pics of hula girls . Gave some to my guitar teacher , and thought they were the hoot . A pick is pick , there 's no doubt about that , but a little art work sort gives it a personality .	1
I really like this delay . It 's simple and works well . I really am starting to love Behringer . Great pedal for a great price .	1
I suppose it does what it is suppose to do , it is not expensive and a good way to get a feel if I want to spend more bucks for a better one .	1
Bought this distortion pedal for our son ... who plays his electric guitar daily . He loves the functionality of it as well as the ease of use . It also produces a nice & # 34 ; distorted & # 34 ; sound quality and tone ( I do n't know if I would agree , as my generation hails from a different genre of music ) . But he loves it and I guess that 's all that matters !	1
I 'm sure glad that I bought these straps , there not leather but are put together very well . I plan on using them as backups in the studio . The price was just right , cam quickly and I 'd buy them again .	1
All that needs to be said is that & # 34 ; It 's a Peterson & # 34 ; Just the best Tuner 's ever . I also use one on My Pedal Board , Would n't use anything else ! ! ! ! ! !	1
it holds about 6 to 7 picks . pressure is just right and overall size is very nice and adequate . would recommend .	1
this pedal ... i tried it out thru a silver face fender twin ... wow , it cranks , .. ! ..it really will produce marshall plexi tones ... .especially noticeable in the lower registers ... on the E and A strings ... if you want a marshall stack sound , this is it , , , if you wanty a variety , i would recommend using this in line with one or two other distortions , so you can chose any amp sound you need , , , really people , for these prices i bought one of every pedal these guys make ... and they all are super , , !	1
Very useful for acoustic guitars , electric and bass . If you do n't have a pedal board with a tuner , this is invaluable to quickly tune up . Small form factor and can be thrown into a guitar case . Good accuracy compared to my Korg pitchblack	1
I love dunlop straps because I 'm a tall guy and they 're long enough for me not to look like an electric-guitar-playing-mariachi .	1
I feel that every microphone is great compare to nothing . It works great thank you , Nady and Amazon . It 's compact and great to use .	1
This is a simple humidifier for guitars with a round sound hole . It would not work for an f-hole archtop or other types of instruments such as mandolin or ukulele . Inside the sturdy plastic case is what appears to be an ordinary kitchen sponge . If you use distilled water ( as recommended ) it should last quite a while . The top comes off with a gentle press on the sides . The dry sponge can be a little difficult to remove with fingers but tweezers or needle nose pliers work perfectly . Do n't push it all the way in after moistening and you wo n't have a problem . I drip a little distilled water on the sponge , squeeze out any excess , and the assembled case pops in easily between the D and G strings , suspended in the middle of the sound hole . They ca n't be seen in the photo but there are small ridges on each side that hold the top in place against the strings . I 've never had one of these move from where I left it.If the sponge is n't dripping wet you should never have a problem with drops of water in the guitar or case . When the humidity is very low ( 30 % or less ) the sponge dries out in 2 to 3 days even if the case is n't opened . As with most humidifiers of this type you will have to check every few days.If you have ever had a crack appear in the top of favorite guitar ( or do n't want to see one ) use a guitar humidifier ! Especially during the winter - heating a house tends to drop the indoor humidity below safe levels ( between 45 % and 60 % is ideal for most guitars ) . Air conditioning can do the same . For especially valuable guitars it would be worth buying a hygrometer to keep in the case but for most guitars having one in the room where you keep you guitar ( s ) is okay . For many reasons it 's always best to keep your guitar in a case or gig bag when not in use . A humidifier is inexpensive extra precaution at those times of year when temperature or humidity changes quickly .	1
This is a convenient way to keep your picks close in case you drop one or need to chance to different pick weight . I do n't have a bass , however , it fits great on my acoustical and electric guitar .	1
For the price I think it 's hard to get any better than this . I love this case . It fits perfectly in the overhead bin on planes . It 's light and feels comfortable when you carry it . Had mine for 2 years now and no complaints , still as good as new . The look is not that inspiring , but it protects your guitar . Some reviews are mentioning faulty hinges but I 've had no problems with mine .	1
What was it , brillcream ? a dab will do ya ? Something like that -This is all you need for contact cleaning . Worth the coin .	1
This does n't look very robust , I expect it will work well in my home studio but if my kids get with in 6ft of it ; consider it broken . The swivle hinge is secure and will hold it 's position as well as the clamp but they could not have been made any more marginally weak.The backing board mine came with is about 2/3 the size of a full sheet of paper , make what you will of that ... and mine is actually secured to the clamp with dual side adhesive so separating them would be a chore and a risk.Overall , a reasonable value and I 'm glad I bought it .	1
There 's nothing wrong with this stand , but for the life of me I can not imagine how a manufacturer could manage to screw up an plain old straight mic stand .	1
I really do n't see how Gibson can make and sell these for $ 99 ! The tech at the guitar shop ca n't see how either . I plugged this into my roland micro cube and tried some effects . I was really surprised to see how well they sounded . I 'm not a guitar player so this uke is just a toy/experiment for me . If you are really into electric sound , I recommend going the guitar route . If you just want to play around a little , this uke will do .	1
By now , you have probably read about the problem with the USB connection generating a high pitch sound during recording making the USB functionality unusable ( an Amazon reviewer referred to this as a `` fatal flaw , '' and I heartily agree ) . I experienced this firsthand , then read folks struggling with the issue on the Mackie support blogs . When I called Mackie support to seek a fix , I was told that the problem was well known and the newer lots had been corrected with new hardware . They sent me a new Mackie Board from the newer lots , and I returned my old one . I have not had any problems with the USB functionality since . I am thankful to Mackie for the great customer service , especially since I addressed the problem after the one year warranty had expired.I 'm assuming that purchases made now will not have the problem , but if it does , contact Mackie to get a replacement.At this point , I am still running the board through its paces , but thus far so good .	1
This is a sharp looking strap that looks much nice in person than in the photos here on Amazon . The strap feels sturdy , and the material is just slippery enough to make moving about easy . Definitely glad I bought this !	1
I cold not believe how much more sturdy my guitar is in this stand . I had the typical guitar stand before and had to be very careful about it tipping over . This one is so secure and my guitar has never felt like it would tip over . Small and sturdy . I use it at practice and during our live shows . You ca n't go wrong with this .	1
Overall , I like this winder . It 's handy having the wire cutter built into it . But when I am winding new strings , it often slips off . Since I am using one hand to hold tension on the new string , I would prefer this to hold on more securely so I do n't have to put it back on several times . But all in all , it 's a lot better than winding by hand , and it seems sturdy .	1
This thing sounds great with my tube amps , both with my 2 watt danelectro amp from 1962 with it 's 8 inch speaker and my 12 watt excelsior from fender . It has a good range of overdrive levels . It is clearly a vintage style effect that is good for classic rock and dirty lo-fi stuff like The Black Keys , The White Stripes , and garage band like stuff . It is good as a light tone shaper and boost to put a distortion effect into feedback heaven and into total over the top sputtering fuzz . I love mine for the price , and its a good mix up compared to my modded SD-1 and my overdriven tube amps . It 's different and just worth having to mess around with . Just be a bit gentle and the thick plastic case and switch will last . Also , the blue LED is very bright . Thats either an annoyance or great . Rock on !	1
As usual an excellent Zoom product.Adds to my playing . Just love this thing . Not too difficult to get the hang of . Even for me .	1
I use the capo for my guitar and it sounds awesome . I like to put the capo on the first fret and when I play a song I made , it sounds really really good . The capo is very easy to use as well .	1
This capo is awesome , it looks and feels very nice and premium , it works on all of my guitars not much more you can ask for .	1
Great sound quality , meets full expectations . Cable is very flexible and also seems strong and good physical quality . It 's worth spending a few extra dollars on a good quality cable rather than to buy other crappy cables .	1
To describe my impressions of the TH-2000-S versus my well-used Sennheiser HD-201s I chose a few favorite reference tracks that illustrate different instrumental timbres and production values : I like to use recordings I know well so I can quickly detect varying emphasis in frequency response and clarity.Andres Segovia - ` Variations on a Spanish Folk Tune - Narvaez ' from ` My Favorite Spanish Encores'.In my opinion one of the finest recordings of solo classical guitar I 've ever heard , both for the performance and the sheer beauty of sound . The distinguishing points of this opening piece are the bass notes that Segovia 's arrangement of the original vihuela-texture really emphasize . For me there 's a difference between bass presence and bass clarity : I 'll gladly trade less ` oomph ' in the gut for the kind of definition the Tascam 's bring out : warm , well-defined , with a crisp and clear treble edge . The Sennheisers , while equally balanced , were far muddier and less defined at the low end with less presence and sparkle on top . They were also considerably quieter and this applies across the board - the TH-2000-S just puts out a lot more sound at similar volume settings.Jeff Beck ` You Know What I Mean ' from ` Blow By Blow'.The George Martin production remains for me one of the most colorful instrumental electric guitar records ever made . The clean separation and space in the mix between guitar , electric piano , clavinet , bass and drums is always a joy to hear on a good sound system . The TH-2000s again demonstrated more punch in the mids and bottom end than the Sennheisers and overall more presence . It 's a 24-bit recording and this is the first time I can honestly say I hear the difference - like being there in the control room , seriously . There 's a greyness to the Sennheisers that frankly never bothered me before , but after hearing the Tascam phones , I doubt I 'll ever be satisfied with less again.Stravinsky Violin Concerto - Anne Sophie Mutter from ` Mutter Modern'.The words I keep coming back to are ` presence ' and ` clarity ' . I can hear string attacks , counter voices in woodwinds and an increase in overall spaciousness with the TH-2000-S that I simply do n't hear with the Sennheiser phones.As far as craftsmanship , the TH-2000-S weighs more than my other phones and much of that weight is in the band rather than the cups . The sliding cup adjustment is easy to move yet ratcheted to stay in place securely when removing the phones casually . The cup mounts are really well-designed and allow fine-grained 4-way rotation that guarantees a snug fit regardless of the size and shape of your head and ears . I like the balanced feel and snug fit on my admittedly large head . The 2-3 '' cushion along the inside of the band and in particular the adds comfort.The cord is a hybrid - the 2-3 ' closest to the phones is flat 1/8 '' diameter , well-insulated 'matte-finish ' and flexible . Beyond that there 's another foot of coiled wire that will comfortably expand another 3-4 feet . I think it 's a nice compromise that 's probably biased towards most users sitting fairly close to an output jack - you can avoid having to deal with excess cord unless you need to.As we get older our hearing changes : for most people it 's a decrease in high-frequency response but it also occur across the entire spectrum . Simply listening louder is n't always the best solution and it can be a tremendous ear-opening experience to try a pair of better quality headphones . I 'd encourage anyone excited by quality sound to experiment and these Tascam TH-2000-S are a good place to start .	1
This bag is well padded , has backpack straps to carry comfortable , and several pockets to hold cable , extra strings , picks , and much , much more . For the price , I feel like it is a steal . Some people complain about the smell . It kind of smells like motor oil . It is strange , but being I have been around that smell so much , it does n't bother me . Be warned about it though .	1
After you use these the large , flimsy old school picks will be used just when you do n't have one of these babies available . These are the best picks out there . If you do n't have these already you better purchase them now . Black or Red , the color is the only difference .	1
I have one one these from the 80 's back home , and when I was looking for a new peddle , I found this was still the best around . I remember searching for the right peddle back in the 80 's and going through dozens of them before settling on the Rat . And it 's exactly the same ... Simple , sturdy and its settings are perfect from crunch to blistering distorted sustain . I run it through all manner of amps - including Marshalls , Vox , and even Crate , both tube and transistor , and with a few quick easy adjustments I get exactly what I 'm looking for no matter the box.I 'm an old school player - meaning I want my sound to come from the guitar and amp instead of processors . This is just an enhancement to my sound , and not the basis of it ... though I expect anyone will get what they want from this baby .	1
I 'm a new guitarist and nobody else would want to hear everything I play . I however , am having a ball playing as loud as I want with as much or as little gain as I feel like at the moment with my Classic Rock Guitar Headphone Amp . My Rickenbacker 360 sounds just the way I want , with as much clarity or with all the & # 34 ; smoke & # 34 ; as I feel like dialing in for now . It is SO nice to be free of the amp and cable on the floor and can quickly plug in , put in my ear buds , and practice for a while anywhere I want , anytime I want . Downside : I wish it had a little reverb to dial in or switch on to closer match my full size Vox amp and the controls are small/hard to read but easy to learn . You do get a pop when you turn it on because there is no tube warm up time . Solution : Hit the switch before putting in your buds if your sensitive . I plan to pick up other versions of the amPlug from Vox to extend my fun . This was a good choice . Buy one !	1
I recently picked up the TC Electronic MojoMojo Overdrive at a steal of a price , but I 'm evaluating based on its inherent quality relative to the retail price . I own many different overdrives , including light overdrives in the `` Tubescreamer '' , and some ones capable of getting a bit more raucous ( Blues Driver , OCD , Joyo Ultimate Drive , etc. ) . To me , this is closer to the Tubescreamer family , as it does better as a clean boost or light overdrive . Actually , the separate knobs for Bass and Treble and its darker tone remind me a bit of the Digitech Bad Monkey.BUILD QUALITY - Outstanding . It has an `` MXR '' style click button press , but the mechanism feels sturdy and built to last . The 9V jack is on the top , out of the way of the I/O jacks . The battery compartment opens with a unique oversized flat screw/button that you can easily get open with your fingers , or maybe a quick turn of a screwdriver . The thing is dense and build solid as a rock . I always appreciate the extra weight with pedals because lighter ones are less crush-resistant , and tend to get punted around by your cables . Finally , the 4 knobs are built will with some force feedback , and several of them are actually notched to settle into the `` 12 '' position , which is a nice touch.TONE QUALITY - Obviously , the tone quality is the most subjective part of this review . I would not be at all critical of a reviewer who gave this a `` 5 '' and absolutely loved it , as several previous reviewers did . But based on the pedals I have used and my experiences with the MojoMojo , it feels more like a `` 4 '' to me . The tone is very warm , almost to the point of being muddy . Whether the mod switch is a `` boost '' or a `` cut '' , the pedal is bassier in the `` up '' position . Do n't get me wrong , I definitely appreciate the abundance of low-end frequencies , but it might get some tweaking to get that high end to shine through . I could also easily see it getting lost in the mix if you play with other instruments . It does a nice job of adding a bit of gain and saturation to your tone without coloring it too much with different character . However , if you 'd like a similar effect with a much more expressive ( and brighter ) output , try the Mad Professor Sweet Honey Overdrive , or its `` clone '' companion , the Joyo Sweet Baby Overdrive.EASE OF USE/VERSATILITY - Many overdrives only have the single tone control , so I was excited to see controls for Bass and Treble . Still , I feel like this is a pedal that could be great with some amps , and very muddy with others . I will update my review if my feelings change , as I have a few different combinations I want to try out . I feel that the preferred use of this pedal is as a stacked overdrive pushing some other type of overdrive or distortion . This is much the way you would use a Tubescreamer . I will say that it is one of the more `` tube-like '' overdrives I have tried . Hit the notes lightly , and you get a clean , transparent tone . Attack them harder , and the higher output from the guitar will push the overdrive and cause further breakup , much like a tube amp . However , if your hope is simply to plug into the MojoMojo into a clean amp and expect classic rock tones , you may be a bit disappointed with it as a standalone overdrive pedal .	1
Playing an acoustic ukulele with all nylon strings , I 've preferred just to strum using my fingers because `` traditional '' plastic picks are just too harsh and loud . Even felt picks are too harsh ( not to mention the dust/shedding they do ) .The Wedgie is EXACTLY what I 've been looking for . Harder than my thumb , softer than plastic or felt , the 3.1mm Hard Rubber Wedgie is the Goldilocks pick ; right in the butter zone.I tried the `` Soft '' and `` Medium '' Wedgies , but both were just too soft . The Soft Wedgie over-grabs the strings and winds up dragging and producing a dull tone . The Medium is better , but is still too dull and the action is a bit too soft.But the Hard Wedgie is the clear winner . I get great volume and tone without the harsh twang of plastic on nylon strings.The only negatives I 've found are:1 . They can leave skid marks on your pick guard . No big deal , as it wipes right off.2 . They break down faster than I 'd like . Of course , that could just be my expectations.Still , if you 're looking a softer-than-plastic pick , this is the one to get . No pick noise , just strings . I could n't be happier .	1
I bought the TS version of these cables , and they have served me well , These are of the same quality , and a great value for the price .	1
I 'll just say , newbie to ukulele , no idea how to tune it , instructions online say GCEA , I put this on the head , plucked each string , tuned the machine head until it said dead on , and that was it . I keep this clipped to my ukulele standInstrument Stand for Violin , Ukulele and Other Small Instruments ( see my reviews of it , it 's so so , the stand ) , and just turn it on and tune the uke before I take it off the stand . ONly time will tell how these little nickel watch battery style battery lasts , I find them a bear to buy , but time will tell . Anyhow , I concur with the reviews on here , glad I listened to them , and for any brand new ukulele players out there , this is the one to get . C ya	1
they work well . For me , the instalition was n't that hard , it took me maybe four or five minutes . The screws provided were a bit bigger than my BC Rich Avenge Beast 's stock strap system , BUT when you read the directions and lube the screws up with a small amount of bar soap ( or wax- i used the bar soap though ) the installation becomes easier.Once you put your strap in , its NOT comming out unless you try hard to undo the system , lol.If you need to clean your guitar strap , take off the locking pin and use a flat head screw drive to pop off the retainer clip . Its a quick and harmless way to do it and it may take about a minute or two to undo both strap locks . Its not that hard though and the reward is worth it .	1
I got this on sale from GC for $ 80 shipped ( plus $ 7 tax arrrgh ) . First and foremost this amp is AMAZING . All the hype and positive reviews you read are all true . My playing style varies from horrible attemps at sounding like a real player to half way decent renditions of actual songs ( lol ) and this amp does it all . The tube amp models sound like real tubes and have a tone and sound that just ca n't be described , they have to be heard . The modulations , and del/reverbs are well done also . There are a few of the effects that sound a little vanilla or digital but those can be tweaked with the Fuse software ( or taken out completely ) . All the controls are pretty easy to understand and adjust , and it does not take a brilliant mind to figure out how to make the amp sound good ( even with my substandard playing ability ! Both of my cheap guitars sound great thru this amp . The tuner is pretty accurate and easy to use . Headphones work well also . About my only real complaints are so minor- no place to store the Power cord or USB cord ( included ! ) . Printed documentation is pretty lame but the included DVD is more through . The Fuse software has to be downloaded and as I have limited online speed this took over an hour . The headphone jack is a 3.5mm and most good headphones are still using the 1/4 '' . Not a big deal but the 3.5mm to 1/4 '' adaptors are somewhat weak and can be very touchy . The amp gives an audiable POP when powered down . No corner protectors on this . All in all if you are looking for a great small amp this will give you $ 1000 's of dollars worth of effects and amp models all for under 100 clams !	1
This works perfect with the quick release system I also purchased . I mostly purchased this so my buddies can play my guitars without adjusting my favorite strap . It also has a pick holder that comes in handy when you need an spare , or want to put it away without loosing it .	1
I figured I would take 2mins out of servicing the line of ladies that formed after receiving this pic to do a review . The pics shape and thickness is actually perfect ( TWSS ) for playing and gripping . Also the paint seems to be holding after quite a few hours of playing . I would suggest getting two packs since you will need 1 pick and the other 11 can go to the children you fathered due to this pic .	1
These things grab the mic and wo n't let go . They are worth the extra cost . Buy them if you hate worrying about your mics slipping .	1
These are pretty good quality tweed cables . I prefer the tweed , they seem not to tangle as easy and they are usually very easy to identify at gigs . They also make one with the 90 degree 1/4 inch input as well .	1
I wanted a noise reducer because I have like 10 pedals and the loud feedback I was getting back through them was insane . I got this one because it wa cheaper and basically thinking why not ? It 's like $ 25 . It was a great choice . The pedal stops nearly all unwanted feedback and does n't alter your tone . It does take some time to figure it out but after that its golden . It 's great .	1
So , first up : I 've been using Macs to record music since the G4 Cube ... yeah , go look that up . Anyway , I know my way around audio recording on Apple devices.And then : yeah , this thing looks kind of cheesy or flimsy ... BUT : I have n't encountered anything so Plug & Play simple as the Apogee JAM 96k since Gefen introduced the iMic . Just plug in the USB or Lightning cable , plug in your instrument and GO.Also , it 's not flimsy . It is made of plastic , but the thing has a bit of heft to it and survived a tumble to the floor from my desk.It pulls power from your machine , so no worries about some adapter introducing hum to your recordings . This also helps those of us using electric guitars that do n't have extra-wound humbuckers.I tested the Apogee JAM on a new ( 2014 ) MacBook Air , an iPhone 5 , and a 2013 iPad Mini . Garageband instantly knew what was going on , but ProTools did need a bit of coaching.A small device that does n't color input sound and does n't get in the way ... just what I needed !	1
The only complaint that I have is the instructions they are kind of shallow , if you have musical theory background you should not have much trouble , I 'm no expert I have a some knowledge beyond basic , and it 's really helpfull to take some reference learning new things , visualize quickly chords , scales , mayor and minor scales , you can view there relationship it 's a great tool to learn , if you have deep knowledge maybe you dont need it . For complete begginers it might be difficult to start without reading and taking time to study . This is a great complement to study theory .	1
I ordered two of these stands and they work very well ! Definitely keeps my guitars a lot safer than having them leaning against things .	1
I recently got myself a Kenny Wayne Shepherd Stratocaster guitar , I decided that since the guitar he had a set of tens strings installed I would go with these.They work flawlessly.The qualities excellent can not go wrong with Ernie Ball strings no matter what gauge you get .	1
This tuner is easy to use . I have a guitar with a built in tuner that just does n't seem to be perfect on pitch . This tuner is and I am very happy with this purchase .	1
only thing is you need to loosen some strings to get it into place , but worked great for what I wanted to screw around with it ,	1
great price and helped out with recording to a Tascam 4 track cassette ( which I like using on occasion vs digital ) and just plain useful with so many other apps ... ... excellent budget dynamic mics and sweet case for storage ! ! !	1
This is the best little guitar pedal adapter I 've used , and I 've used many over the last three decades . It 's exceptionally quiet , which many are not , and it puts out 9.6 volts , which will drive your pedals a little more solidly than all but a brand new alkaline battery . And you wo n't have to buy a new one every dozen hours ! I 've used this on a splitter to drive three pedals , but at four and up I can hear the current drop a bit . Still , that 's a good thing because it reminds me that tone comes from my fingers , not a box on the floor . But it sure is nice to have some Gilmouresque delay , and a little extra gain driving the tubes , and this is the best 9v adapter for pedals available that I know of , including the Boss ones . Dan has released some cool , well-made pedals in the past 15 years , and this little wall wart is a worthy companion.A very good deal at 15 clams .	1
I was shocked when I got this tuner and witnessed how accurate it was . For the sake of letting you know its compatibility , I have used this to effectively tune an acoustic guitar , an electric guitar , a mandolin , and a 4-string bass . That 's a huge range for any tuner ! I 've had older versions of clip-on tuners and this one just works faster and better . Recommended for any application in which you may need a variety of ranges . The ones made for guitar have limited range , but are cheaper , but I would imagine they 're just as accurate.I 'm not a huge fan of the red color , it is really bulky and noticeable on all the instruments I 've had , but I 'm happy with the trade-off . I just wish there was a smaller , more discrete option or something in black or a more muted color .	1
I ordered these because I bought a variety pack of picks from Musician 's Friend and there was one lonesome very thin celluloid pick in the pack . I loved how it quieted the strumming on my acoustic dreadnought , so I went on the hunt for very thin picks . The celluloid one fell apart quickly , so I wanted a better material.These white nylon picks should last a lot longer . The non-pointed end is all grippy ( textured ) , so it does n't work great if you like to use the more rounded corners of a pick , but it does the job and I like it . The pointed end is very thin and slides off the strings nicely , but you can still pick with it if you 're combining picking and strumming.I 'll keep using thicker picks for picking-only songs and for louder strumming , but for more mellow strumming and to keep from bothering other folks in the house , these are great.UPDATE : I 've been using them for more than a year now , and they are pretty flimsy for picking notes in a mostly-strumming song ... but you can do it . This is still my favorite pick for strumming . Hope this helps .	1
I 've been using Elixir strings since Gore first made prototypes over 10 years ago . I use both electric and acoustic . The product performs exactly as they guarantee it will . Every once in a while I 'll get a & # 34 ; dead & # 34 ; string . I 'll just call the customer service number and they will replace it free of charge . Same thing with strings that break while tuning them up .	1
For the price it serves as a good resting place for the guitar when not being played . Well designed and useful .	1
My kids were excited to split this pack of picks . Since there were two of each in the pack , they did n't have to argue over who got which pick . These are very unique and a nice way to personalize your playing . I think these would make a great gift for a grandparent or parent who played guitar in the 60 's and 70 's .	1
I actually like this bench a lot . It fits into my gear back ( rolling duffle style ) that contains my cables / power strips etc. , with only the folded legs sticking out of the bag . I have the KT7800 , which is much larger seat area , and easier to adjust . Depends on your preference I suppose , this one is smaller / lighter , the other is larger / easier to adjust .	1
The only reason I give 4 stars is because I ordered 2 of these and 1 had the chord with it and one was missing the chord ... I ordered both at the same time , other than that they are good hot mics ...	1
I play and teach classical guitar and needed a good digital recorder with which to record myself and my students and also be able to convert to mp3 format to upload to the internet . I 've recorded several solo pieces and it does pick up the guitar very well , including all string squeaks and fret buzzes ( darn it ) . So , it will force you to clean up your playing a bit . If you are a musician and want a recorder that is very portable and relatively easy to use , then this little gadget is quite good . It wo n't give you `` recording studio '' quality , but you can clearly hear the deep tones of a classical guitar and no hiss , or background noise ( unless you have big-mouthed birds like I do ) so you 're recording is very clear.When I get ready to record , I set the gain as described in the manual , then set the recorder on my music stand and begin playing . Since I bought the 4G card , I can play the piece as many times as I need too in a row without worrying about it running out of memory just as I finally play the piece to my specifications . Also , if you connect the H2 to an electrical outlet and not rely on the batteries , that is one less worry . Your H2 wo n't die during recording because the batteries give out.I ca n't really tell any difference in the recording quality with or without the wind sock that came with it . It sounds the same . I guess if I were a singer I would use it to screen out wind but a guitar does n't really need it . Yes , the screen is very small and difficult to read - I keep a magnifying glass handy , but now I 've pretty much got the button pushing sequences memorized and do n't need to use it as often to see the screen . Also , download a free editing program such as `` Audacity '' so you can convert your recordings to various formats.I 'd give it 5 stars if the case was a little more substantial . It seems fragile and I dropped it once but luckily it bounced off my foot which had a big fuzzy house shoe on it so it did n't break . But it might have if I had not broken it 's fall . And you will need a longer USB cord . I ca n't believe the one they sent was so short . But that is a very easy fix and overall this is one nice little tool . And for the price , I 'd buy it again ! : - } UPDATE 2.22.12I 'm still using the H2 Zoom on almost a daily basis to record my students playing and my own playing . I still love it , it works great and I feel I really purchased a great item .	1
3 long , 3 short . Drop in replacement for both my MIM and MIA strat . Added mass , easier to tune . Good , cheap , easy upgrade .	1
The traditional black box tuners are boring and slow . This thing is super responsive to string selection just hopping on the new tone immediately , exact , easy to use , fun to look at . There is a linkage arm that is not shown in the photo that makes it even better .	1
This is hands down the best guitar stand on the market . It will last a lifetime and never drop your axe . I have two of these plus a wall mount hanger for my basses and I love them all !	1
These EXL115 .011 gauge D'Addarios are good strings at a good price . They sound nice and bright on my Epiphone Sheraton II and particularly twangy on the lower end of the scale , which I like . I 'd rather get these and replace them periodically than try to make any kind of old strings last a long time . The strings do n't break either .	1
This is probably obvious to more experienced musicians , but for Amateur musicians ( like me ) , If you think that you know how your audience hears you because you listen through your monitor while you play , then you 're fooling yourself . You have to listen to your mix by recording it , then listening while you 're not playing/singing .	1
I was displeased with a somewhat poor-quality strap I was using before . It just did n't seem to want to hang on , so I went ahead and decided to buy a replacement.This is what I chose , and notably , I chose it for the color , just simply because I thought a white strap would look nice on a red and white guitar.So far , it 's given me no problems , and it looks very nice and functions perfectly . This is a great bargain , too , since it 's certainly not an expensive accessory .	1
These Martin strings ( M170 ) are n't bad . They just are not the sound I was looking for . I ended up like the Ernie Ball Earthwood extra light instead . The Martin 's are little shallow on the low end unlike the Ernie Ball . Other people will love them though . They are easy to play .	1
Got this tuner/metronome as a replacement for a tuner-only model . This is INCREDIBLY easy to use right out of the package . The tuner function indicates clearly whether you are sharp or flat ( or amazingly in tune ) . The metronome is easy to use and has great subdivisions ( eighth notes , sixteenths , etc ) . For home and ensemble use , I personally could n't ask for a better gadget for the price . Very happy with it !	1
they work . its great not worrying about dropping your instrument on stage . ive done it it sucked ! worth every penny !	1
Some will argue that these are not necessary for your monitors , however as somebody who has worked in music for more than half their life , I can assure you that , whereas they 're not life or death , they do make a significant improvement on the listening process , especially in your project studio . No , they 're not going to make your music sound any better , but they will give you a more detailed and accurate bass response when your monitoring . Even cooler is the fact that the pads come with 2 extra pieces of padding that will essentially let you customize the position of the monitors in that you can angle them up or down ever-so-slightly . Lastly , although my monitors fit perfectly on the pads , I ca n't help but to think that if my monitors were any larger , I would need a second pair , especially if they were positioned horizontally . All and all , overpriced or not ; they really make a world of difference .	1
I like the fact that it can be & # 34 ; partially & # 34 ; installed with the cord coming out of the sound hole or it can be easily installed on a more permanent basis by cutting the cord to length and running it inside the guitar body through the end pin hole ( which will have to be enlarged a bit ) . Either way , once plugged in , it sounds great . This pickup maintains the great acoustic sound of my guitar , a Blueridge BR-160 . I installed some Fishman & # 34 ; under the saddle & # 34 ; pickups in a few Martin guitars and this pickup sounds just as good , if not better . If you do n't mind the pickup visible in the sound hole , this is the way to go . Another nice thing about it is the ease of changing out the batteries as compared to the undersaddle type pickups where the batteries are attached to the inside body of the guitar .	1
I have a solid non weight relief Les Paul Traditional that is one heavy motha and these locks keep my fat girl nice and close to me . Like these better then the bulkier Dunlops .	1
The shell and the lining of the case are perfect : hard on the outside , and soft on the inside.I opened up the box and my Epiphone Dot slid right in.The only thing that worries me is that the hinges feel a little cheap , and the lock cold be beat with a bic pen.I 'm not traveling around with my guitar too much , so that 's not a problem for me , but I would worry a bit if I were checking it on an airline.Otherwise , it works perfectly for what I bought it for - protecting it in my mancave / basement from dings and scratches .	1
Excellent strap for the money . The leather is thick and supple . In fact the materials are so thick , that it can be a little tricky to get the adjustment tail setup.A note about length- Some might find the standard Levy 's strap length too short , so be aware what you need and note there are XL versions of these . For me , many straps on the market in this price range are just too long for me , including those from Franklin , Dunlop ( BMF wide ) , and Mono ( even the short model was about an inch too long ) . I 'm a bass player and when standing , I prefer my bass to be at or just above waist height . A few basses , I prefer higher . I 'd suggest if you have a strap which places your instrument where you are most comfortable , measure button hole to button hole and be sure you 're ordering the right length .	1
Great deal on a capo , it 's about the same quality as one i would buy for 5x the amount elsewhere . It takes a while for the shipping , but that 's stated in the description . I was pleasantly suprised . I would recommend this capo .	1
just what you see . A good variety of different picks . I got it for me and my dad . My dad plays guitar , and he likes the thinner onnes	1
this is a must have pedal for any rock player , tight compressed distortion sound , you could play with the EQ to get the sound your looking for , it goes from an overdrive sound to a really heavy distortion , It 's build to last forever , the sustain is fantastic and the top boost give you another range of possibility's.the only downside is the battery , get the power adapter , batteries wont last more than 2 or 3 days and you have to unscrew the back to replace it.Overall , I 'm really happy with this pedal .	1
I use these pins on some of my 3/4 size guitars . Not really sure if I can notice a difference in sound between these , plastic , or ebony pins that I have but they are attractive and certainly appear to be different .	1
These work just like you want them to . But a new strap and put these on right away . It 's worth it .	1
I purchased this product to replace the pins on my Martin 0-16NY . I believe the ebony pins will be perfom admirably . Additionally , the pearl inlay lends class to the guitar .	1
for the price you ca n't really beat this little amp , the only down fall is that at full volume with the gain up , the little speaker gets kinda muddy , but for a bright clean tone it works well , the tone controle offers a well rounded array of tones and the gain is great from a blues to metal tone of gain.the headphones input just is handy when wanting to play into the wee hours of the morning without disturbing anybody , but with the headphones hooked up you can really hear the digital sound it makes ... but for the money it 's a great buy	1
Just like the ones in the store . We mounted our two ukes on these . Put our hangers in studs , but they come with those plastic gizmos for drywall . Heavy duty and nice looking . Great price . You just ca n't beat the speed and convenience of Amazon .	1
I 'd read a lot about the One Spot power system . I needed 220V power overseas and so I ordered this . It is truly a very nice product and amazingly quiet . I currently have some high end power bricks on my two larger pedal boards ... I may swamp them out fo this one . Highly Recommend it .	1
Wrestling the guitar in and out of the case when you want to practice is inconvenient . This stand allow for a reasonably safe place to store a guitar when it is out of the case . It even has a band across the neck of the guitar to keep it in the rack . I like it as a safe stoage place as well as the ease it offers to grab my guitar and practice for a few minutes . It is a reasonably well made rack at a very good price . It is much safer to have my guitar in this rack than laying about in the house waiting for someone to step on my guitar.update : January 7 , 2013 ... liked the first one so much I got two more for my other two guitars . I love being able to pick up one of the three and do a few licks . Each one is different and now they are all three out of the their cases and at my fingertips . The price is right and they keep them safely stored .	1
I enjoyed this set very much due to the variety of picks , as it was interesting to try different models . Dunlop picks are great !	1
I 've only been playing ukulele for about 3 years , so I 'm new to using a capo . It seems to hold tight .	1
Well , MADE by Elixir and DEVELOPED with Taylor Guitars ... these strings were designed for the new 800 ( Rosewood ) series guitars that came out this year ( 2014 ) ... the promise is a & # 34 ; bolder high end , fuller low end & # 34 ; ... I am a long-time Taylor owner and favor their 800 series ( Rosewood/Spruce is my favorite combo in tone woods ) ... I have almost always used Elixir Nanoweb Phosphor Bronze lights on my guitars ... I like not only the tone but the feel and longevity of these strings ... I have never had any issues with Elixir Nanowebs ... I recently picked up an 812ce First Edition 12-Fret ... such a fine instrument and it came with the Elixir HD 's ... took some getting used to as far as feel ( due to the slightly higher gauges of the treble strings - E , B & G ) ... but as far as sound , they are great ... the D , A & low E strings are no different from the regular Elixir PB Lights so I am not sure about the claim of & # 34 ; fuller low end & # 34 ; ... compared to what ? Unless the extra string tension of the treble strings also contributes to a little more bass response ... I am not sure how these strings will perform on guitars other than Taylor 's but what anyone should notice is more volume and clarity from the treble strings ... that is what I notice most from the HD 's compared to the regular ... I still find no fault with the regular Elixir Nanaweb PB 's but will most likely continue to run the HD 's on my 12-fret ... I may also try them on my older 814ce just to see if there is any difference/improvement ... so far I find the set well balanced with good clarity and sustain ... try them out and make your own decision ...	1
Polyweb strings have a heavier coating so I prefer nanoweb for the ultra-thin coat and brighter sound . They 're easy on my fingers and make the most beautiful sound . Because they 're coated and have anti-rust , they last up to months longer than regular strings and do n't make much finger sounds . Favorite strings .	1
Ca n't say much more than the description . It 's a cheap box that works . Nothing fancy and not for everyone . If you just need a box that is cheap this is it .	1
great little tool to assist you while replacing strings , cleaning or tuning , keeps headstock still and then folds up neatly to fit in a drawer , kit or pocket	1
What a difference a pop filter makes , I use on a condenser mic , it lets me get a little more gain input , clamps on easy and holds good , the flex piece holding the filter could be a little more rigid but does the job . I like the way it looks when mounted on the mic stand extension , It has improved the vocal tracks . Just one more affordable improvement for the home studio .	1
Use it every time I restring my guitar , works really good . I recommend this to any musician that plays regulary .	1
I ordered these picks in bulk to use while I was recording/producing . I absolutely love these picks and swear by them . I 've been a guitarist for almost 7 years and these were the picks that I landed on years ago and stuck to . I 've had years of lessons , licks and picks and these are the absolute endgame for me ! Perfect grip for leads and perfect thickness for Rhythms . I 'd order again if I had to .	1
i bought these because i could n't see spending $ 4.50 a dozen at the local music store . I figure 12 dozen will last me for years . Get them for yourself if you use and lose picks like I can easily do .	1
This stand ( it just arrived in the mail ) will be durable in the years to come with my music I can tell . Awesome stand and I would recommend to anyone !	1
I 'm using it for my Alesis Q49 MIDI keyboard . Folds up easy so I can tuck it away . It may not work with a keyboard smaller than 49 keys . As you lower it the support spreads out wide . Good quality . Adjustable height and for the dept of the keyboard .	1
I spent a lot of time on Amazon reading reviews - comparing prices . I wanted an amp that would have overdrive and I also wanted some power . There are so many choices from the small portable units ( I was afraid they would sound like toys ) to the big units ( They would sound great but I could n't afford them ) . I am thrilled with the Starcaster . This amp delivers a huge sound and the overdrive sounds great for grunge and metal while you can also play crisp clear rock or country through it . If you want a small amp to take anywhere and be able to show your rock star image - this is the one for you .	1
Fender came up with a fine electric guitar holder - one of two new models , the other for acoustic guitars . Well built , reliable , folds up , takes little room to care around . Ideal for gigs as well as studio and home . Solid performer . - Michael Haller , 'Captain Soul 's Sound Circus '	1
I have played guitar for about 12 years and these picks are now my favorite picks ever . I ca n't really explain why , they just feel right . Sometimes they break , but what pick light pick does n't unless it 's nylon ?	1
it sounds great . nice and warm and lush . one of the better trems i 've had the pleasure to use . however , i hate the plastic housing , and how the input/output jacks are located . I do n't have heavy feet , so it will probably last a good long while on my board , but i really would n't want to put too much weight on it .	1
Simple , compact , well constructed , easy to use , and sounds good ; all things you would look for in a capo.This is the original Shubb capo , designed for most acoustic guitars with metal strings . The Shubb website describes the huge range of specific capos they make , each with their own specialized use . The C1 is probably the most universal of all the models . This fits a Les Paul Traditional 08 ( Gibson Les Paul Traditional Plus Electric Guitar , Heritage Cherry Sunburst ) , aPRS SE Custom 22 Guitar , Grey Black with Tremolo Bridge , andEpiphone LP Special II Les Paul Collection Electric Guitar , Vintage Sunburstelectrics . The primary use is for a Laguna acoustic.Follow the simple instruction card included with the capo to adjust the tension . It 's key to not get too much tension.We 've had trouble figuring out where to park this capo . Mostly it goes in a pocket . Once the capo is adjusted to fit the neck , it does n't clamp tight on the headstock . Not a huge deal , but a consideration .	1
Item came with two sets of screws , a long set and a shorter set . Looks good on my Yamaha acoustic guitar . Holds my strap well . I am happy I bought this .	1
no complaints here ! the quality is great ! the sounds is excellent ! and my voice sounds wonderful and crisp . use it all the time .	1
These strings are n't for everyone , and probably not what you want for everyday , normal playing . But if you 're looking for a fast-playing string with a bright sound , this is the string . In addition to putting them on my guitar , I also have a six-string banjo ( guitar tuning ) and just could n't get the sound I wanted from regular guitar strings . Light guage nickel strings were recommended to me , and they were exactly what I was looking for . They have a clear , bright sound that great for picking and strumming . I play a lot of bluegrass and Irish music , and I feel these strings are ideal for that purpose . I use a lot of D'Addario strings on my various instruments , and I think they offer the most bang-for-the-buck in terms of quality and tone . You can pay more , but I do n't think you get that much more . Although these were intended for electric guitar , they also work well on resonator guitars .	1
I 'm a bassist , and am familiar with the flat/round/half-round debate on BASSES ( I prefer flats ) . Anyway , my son wanted these for his Epiphone Casino because he heard John Lennon used ( a different brand of ) flat-wounds . They sound AMAZING ! They make that Casino ring like a carillon , yet will get & # 34 ; down & dirty & # 34 ; when called for . A VERY & # 34 ; different & # 34 ; sound range than round wounds . In fact , it 's about time to order another set or three ... .	1
I probably could have found the same screw at the hardware store but these are OEM and fit perfectly . Recommended .	1
This strap is sturdy and looks good and goes well with a Fender Strat , it does n't come off every time you get to jamming out and forget you are not sitting down , so you do n't have to worry about dropping your guitar so you can focus on rocking out .	1
I shopped around local music shops and was discouraged with the prices . Checked out Amazon and was a little skeptical with the reasonable price , but pleasantly surprised when we received it .	1
Second time buying the 6 pack - great deal for the price . I love having the colored cables makes set up so easy . I also like the XLR connectors on these , have n't had one go bad yet .	1
Always looking for that elusive perfect capo , light yet strong and dependably firm ? You just found it.This is an exemplary capo . No surprise , as it 's designed by Ned Steinberger , who understands what it means to strip a guitar down to the basics . It 's made of serious aluminum and the spring is super-solid . The tighten feature means you can put it on your guitar and then tighten it so well that it wo n't come off again until you loosen it . No slippage here ! This also lets you move the capo further behind the fret so it 's even less in the way of your hand , a very useful feature which most other one-hand capos ca n't offer.It 's an easy on-in-seconds design that is as slim and simple as it gets . The rubber is well-bonded and looks unlikely to pull off for years at least , unlike many cheap capos . It sits well on any six-string , though is not flat enough for a classical . But most of us use capos mainly for acoustic and maybe a bit of electric ( unless you 're Albert Collins , who always used one and would have loved the tightening aspect here ) , so this will cover all your basic capo needs.It 's got a little slot for the D'Addario brand tuner , but I use a Snark and these two go together well ; put on the capo , activate the tuner on the headstock , tune it up , and away you go , perfectly in tune in seconds while using a capo ! If you 've ever suffered onstage while switching frets with a capo , this is a godsend combo . The capo also has a little pick slot , which will comfortably take up to about a .73 mm pick . It fits .60 picks perfectly , by the way.This NS Artist Capo is well worth 20-25 bucks , and since I got it my Shubb and Kysers have sat lonely in the corner.If you have n't ever experimented with capos , try them out . They can really change the way you play your guitar , and may help you find you sing better than you think , as we all have our best keys , and a capo can help you find yours . I love playing bluegrass licks in G while capoed at the second fret , for instance . The extra zing and crisper tone make me play different licks and it 's almost like another instrument . This goes for every fret , pretty much , up to about the sixth , where it gets a little cramped.All in all , this is the best capo I 've ever used , especially for this quality at this price .	1
This guitar just got stolen from me ! ! ! Frikkin thieves , I loved this guitar from the moment it was in my hands , it is super light , unlike my other gretsch guitar , so easy to take anywhere , it can handle some rough playing , its simply awesome , specially for what it costs ! I am SOOOOO getting another one : D	1
all joking aside , these heads really are great . tune em right and you 'll get a nice , warm tone from them that 's unmatched with other brands	1
Everyone has there opinions . I was told these were great strings by some and others tell me the quality control has slipped after the passing of John . What I can say is the strings go on really brassy bright for a few days . They slowly mellow out and seem to last a long time . Sound really nice on my Taylor 410CE .	1
Works great	1
No lie , these are the perfect strings for an electric arch-top.Smooth but not dull sounding . Will defiantly be buying more .	1
This Behringer compressor sustainer compare 's to the Boss CS-2 the behringer sustaining is excellent and a tone , compression level is very good and all for $ 25.00 , not putting down the Boss , but for this price you ca n't go wrong .	1
These things are great . No more twisting for 5 mins per string , no more running around the house looking for a pair of clippers . For the price , its definitely worth it imho .	1
GOOD POINTS : [ 1 ] This cable , unlike many other coiled cables I 've tried , does NOT add noise when it 's moved . I swung it about quite a bit while playing through it , and it made no noise at all . [ 2 ] It also has good plugs in that the indentation on the male plug provides a generous gap , making it easy for the female jack to connect to the male end . As a result , the cable does not slip out TOO easily ; the connection between jack and plug is quite secure . BAD POINTS : [ 1 ] The package it comes in says it 's a 20-foot cable . Not even close ! Holding it up by one end , with the other end simply dangling ( i.e. , not plugged into anything ) , I saw that it measures 3 feet ( again , that 's when it 's not stretched ) ; when not stretched at all , it measures just 3 feet . Of course , this would not result in 20 feet when it 's stretched . Sure enough , when I plugged it into an amp , I could COMFORTABLY stretch it to only about 6.5 feet . This might not bother you ; it does n't bother me since I did n't want the extra cable length . But if you need anything like a 20-foot cable , you 're going to have to get something else . [ 2 ] Finally , a minor point : If you 're using this on a guitar with a Strat-style jack , this cable will be a bit -- -but only a bit -- -more difficult than most cables to unplug from the guitar , no matter which end you plug into your guitar , because there 's not much to grip when unplugging . Of course , if you pull on the cable itself , instead of one of the ends , you 'll ruin it in no time . Overall , I am quite happy with this cable and would buy more , since I do n't need more than the length it has , and since it makes no noise .	1
Great guitar strings , and affordable . I have used these for quite a while , and I have always liked them . Recently , I moved to Boston though , and here they seem to rust really quickly . They never used too . Its not that humid here , so I do n't know if I got some bunk strings , or if the quality has gone down in the last year , or if really its the Boston weather . Historically , I have sworn by these though ! !	1
These were the same strings originally strung on my Godin Seagull , and I absolutely love their sound , feel , and durability . The one reason I actually needed them because my G string broke while I was tuning too fast . The sound is almost identical to what D'Addario describes , these strings have a great , uplifting sound to them , hard to soft strums . Playing feels great with them , nothing out of the ordinary either strumming or the fretboard feel , clean and smooth . When replacing , I ran into no problems , quick and easy . I love the strings and their price , definitely will stick with this brand as well .	1
But these seemed to work well on the guitar I was re-stringing . My son thought they were great and he knows quite a bit more.Recommend .	1
this box is what i have been missing out of my setup . always getting the question , & # 34 ; Can i hook my keyboard into your sound board & # 34 ; . Feel good to say that now I have the capability now	1
I thought that this may be just a joke but it turns out that it 's a nice little portable amp.Of course you ca n't drive it very hard or the distortion gets to be too much , but if you keepit low it works very nicely and the price makes it very attractive .	1
Double bass pedal has a quality build.Solid frame , quiet mechanism.Easy to build and breaksdown for transport.Solid attachment to bass drum.Easy to adjust with reversible mallets.As nice as any pedal twicecas expensive , so great value .	1
Excellent value and you know what ... It is identical in every way with the Retail store Product ! Same made in CHINA product with another no name LOGO stuck to it . Perfect for the Garage Band !	1
Germany Company , manufacturing is in China ... I have always found this to make the product hit or miss but the last two Behringer products that are in my hands are very good .	1
Good-sized holder . I placed it between the tuners & it fits like it was made for that spot which is out of the way most of the time . Just enough tension to hold the picks & not too strong to to make it hard for me to remove them . Highly recommended .	1
I 'm not going to do any explaining about the `` science '' behind how this pedal works . I 'm just going to focus this review on how the pedal affects your tone . This definitely is n't a boost , and it 's also not an eq , the BBE sonic stomp is a uniquely functioning pedal . To the ear , it serves to add clarity , depth , and body to your tone . Essentially , this pedal allows you to get the most out of the tones your amp is already producing.The lo contour knob does n't `` increase '' the amount of bass produced by the amp . Rather , it tightens up and generally increases the depth of the bass ( and low mid ) tone . To the ear this may sound at first like the bass has been increased , but it has n't . You 're just hearing all the bass tone that was there in the first place , that was jumbled up as the signal went from your guitar to the amp.The process knob really just focuses on the treble and high mid frequencies . These frequencies can often be very unpleasant and grating to hear , and the sonic stomp sort of evens and smooths out those tones so they are clearer and less harsh.That 's not to say that you ca n't dial in some very aggressive and cutting highs if you play lead metal or something ; indeed , it 'll make those searing lead tones even better.Now , I gave this product 4 stars not because I 've had any issues with it or have n't been in any way unsatisfied with it ; but rather because it 's really a fairly subtle effect . At first I almost could n't tell a difference between having it on and off . With time I 've been able to better recognize and appreciate the impact that it has on my tone , but it does n't make a `` night and day '' difference.I recommend this pedal to someone who already has a tone that you 're happy with , and just want to make it even better . This pedal wo n't make a cheap 15 watt solid- state combo sound like a tube half-stack . It wo n't make you love your tone when you were completely unsatisfied with it before.In conclusion , though I definitely would n't put this pedal into the `` must have '' category , it definitely improves the quality of my tone . This is a pedal that I leave on all the time , as it improves both clean and distorted tones .	1
This is a great mixer if you are looking to do simple podcasting or solo music production at home . It 's a great little unit . The only set back is that you can not use Condenser mics with this , without an external phantom power supply , as there is NO phantom power on this unit . You need to get the 802 model if you need phantom power , otherwise this will work fine with regular XLR or Hi-Z microphones .	1
Expect less for that price . Excellent , fine manufacturing , good finish . Perfect for my Line 6 , 75 wt . It works well at all heights .	1
Despite being so small , it will fill most rooms Completely ! These are lasers ! You can buy one of those cheapo keychain sized lasers and those go for miles so you know this thing will deliver . The patterns they go in are mesmerizing no matter the pace . I have n't tested the sound-feature but I 've seen it on videos . I recommend this to anyone want to be entertained !	1
the best thing I 've purchase for my guitars this year , I 'm not that careful with my guitars maintenance and never though that my fretboard and body finish need that care until i see a video that explain why is important and the live that obviously the instrument get back after cleaning , the 01 and 02 are the best , restore the live of my fretboard , the cleaner and polish make your instrument body shine , the only one that I 've just use once is the string conditioner and can not say because i use this on my brother acoustic guitar and i do n't play with it after the cleaning , but my guitars strings are new right now maybe i update in a few weeks about the strings conditioner.you can buy this with your eyes close , you wont regret the purchase .	1
Item shipped earlier than I 've expected . When I opened the box was surprised as I did n't notice the usb cable . But later I thought that it was impossible and opened the box from another side and here it was ... I have plugged and installed usb driver and dedicated software in a few seconds . It is working fine . Though it has no motorized faders , it does n't make my work uncomfortable at all . I have connected it to a Reaper and Protools software and it 's just working perfect ! I recommend it to home studios , also those who travel with recording gear . Nano is small but quite durable.I am happy with it !	1
If you love delay and want variety , this is your pedal . I run two amps when I play ( often ) and the ping pong is delightful for me . However , in the studio , this pedal shines as well providing a variety of incredible delay options . Being Toneprint enabled is a 100 % plus . Very clean , quiet , and durable . Excellence !	1
Is a good stand . Relatively small but is a secure . The locking top is a good feature as well . Id recommend this over the larger tubular type .	1
I use this when myOn Stage Microphone 13-inch Gooseneck , Blackare too long for what I want to do . Sometimes - on rare occasions - I have used this to extend the length of the 13 '' model.The mic I mainly use this with is aNady DM70 Drum and Instrument Microphone , which is small , relatively light , and works with saxophones as well as drums and cymbals . When I am using that mic for alto and tenor sax , I use anOn Stage MY550 Microphone Extension Attachment Barto clamp to the pole of a regular microphone stand , and attach the gooseneck and DM70 without using a separate mic stand.Because this and its bigger sibling are so versatile I keep a few of each size around , plus a supply of extra extension attachment bars . In some situations they can be a savior during set up . I will empahsize , though , that anything larger than the DM70 or DM80 ( which is slightly larger and heavier ) , and this may not hold your mic in place .	1
Very nice polish ! I have thirteen guitars and I would like to keep them all looking as great as they were new ! Gets very shiny and smooth almost like its new from the guitar shop ! Use it on everything !	1
To start with , I did n't buy this guitar because it was cheap , but because of the unbelievable reviews . I do n't know if they all come out of the box like this one but in the past I have owned and sold my Gretch 12 , my Yamaha 12 , my ovation 12 , but I wo n't be selling this one . I 've had it for 3 months now and have n't adjusted anything , only played this $ 169 12 string from American Musical Supply / amazon . It is the best playing best sounding 12 string I have ever played period ... This guitar set off a couple of other Epiphone purchases ( 2 , one for my son ) AJ220SCE 's and ES-339 , Also great guitars . Most of my life Epiphones were dull over coated junk , not anymore , and it seems that Epiphone is selling cheap to get people to try them . I own Gibson Studio Les Paul , SG , '87 American Strat , Martin D35 , Washburn Rogue , all nice guitars most for a LOT more money . This guitar is a NOBRAINER can not believe the value . American Musical Supply is also great , the first AJ220SCE came in with a bad neck and AMS emailed a return FedEx lable in an hour and after I dropped it off and it was logged in at a UPS outlet around the corner I got an email that the replacement guitar was on the way . When it arrived 3 days later it was a good one ! : ) ) 5+ star service .	1
This pick is great , highly recommended ! I love the sharp attack of the metal tip but the flexible body means the attack is not overly aggressive and metallickey sounding . I also I prefer the feel of a flexible pick . Grip is very good . This is my new favorite rock pick !	1
I was looking for a foot rest for a good value and that is exactly what I got . There is n't too much to say about it . It 's sturdy . It 's adjustable . It 's a great price . It really made playing easier for me .	1
I 've used electronic tuners for a long time . Most of them that I 've owned you have to plug into your instrument . That means they do n't tune with a microphone but only with an electronic signal directly from the instrument . I bought a Korg GA-30 that was about the size of a credit card with a built in microphone to tune acoustic instruments about 8 or 10 years ago . I used that Korg until getting the Snark . The Korg was durable and fairly accurate but the LCD display was n't lit making it tough to read in low light and the needle seemed to jump around sometimes for no good reason . Still for the money the Korg was a good deal on a tuner with a microphone in it 's day.Enter the Snark SN-2 . This Snark will tune about anything . It will tune either by vibration clipped onto the headstock of a stringed instrument or do n't clip it to the instrument and use the built in microphone . Clip it to a music stand , clip it to anything and it still works when you use the built in microphone for a guitar , upright bass , violin , saxophone , trumpet or even a tympani . Use the vibration setting for tuning an acoustic or electric guitar or ukulele or mandolin or banjo without interference from other sound sources . It tunes about anything no matter the notes or key you want to tune your instrument to . It senses the entire scale.The Snark SN-2 has a well lit , clean and bright display that is easy to read in bright light or total darkness . The display pivots to any angle . It is very light so it adds very little weight to the headstock . The battery seems to last a fairly long time , longer than the 9-Volt battery in my tuner pedal that burns through pricey 9 volt Duracells at the rate of about 1 per month.Long term durability seems to be a question to me due the small pivot on all the Snark clip-on tuners . I 've only been using mine for about 2 months now and while the pivot part seems sort of fragile I 've had no issues at all yet and it still works good . I do n't think you should drop it very often . So far I 've dropped mine once with no damage . Even if it did break , 10 Snarks are cheaper than the rack tuner I have and the Snark is just as accurate.While long term durability is undecided I ca n't complain at all about the versatility , accuracy , high visibility display or the low cost . I really like mine and use it everyday on an electric bass or a ukulele or a guitar . It really gets around and tunes them all . The color is sort of a metallic red , almost Candy Apple Red . I ordered spare batteries but have n't needed to change one yet.I 'd buy it again and suggest one as a gift for any musician that does n't have one . I 'm sure they 'll use it often . This tuner is a real good buy at a good price . Spare CR2032 Lithium batteries are less expensive on Amazon , so I suggest ordering several with your tuner so you 'll be prepared.I 've never used the metronome feature other than to check it out . It flashed a locked tempo but I really do n't need that feature .	1
This thing works well and is a little easier to see and less jumpy than my old tuner . The LEDs are a little cheesy compared to the old one though . But maybe that saves on battery life . I do n't know . It gets five stars for just doing its job quietly and for a fair price and not breaking.I 'm also glad I bought the one specifically for guitar/bass and not the chromatic one .	1
Easy and quite simple to use , this tuner is accurate and none intrusive , so you can leave it on your instrument for a quick re-tune on the go .	1
I ordered this for my husband , the musician . He said these are high quality strings giving great tone and good feel . He would definitely purchase this product ... and he 's pretty picky about his guitar strings !	1
Very durable cables ... I 've used them all . Fenders are n't bad . I have used these without any problems whatsoever ! See for yourself !	1
Simple . Solid . Compact . Convenient . Audio quality is unchanged from my no name metal patch cables . For the money , you ca n't beat a six pack of these to open up some extra space on your board and clean it up a bit .	1
It works well with several different instruments that I have . Makes tuning a lot easier and accurate . It is a good value .	1
For the price , I got a little more than expected . The sound is pretty great . The scoop switch gives you a slightly different sound . Other than that your can change amount of distortion . Its cheap , and maybe it does n't have alot of fancy versatility with the settings and whatnot . But for the price this is one hell of a deal ! Quality item.Only complaints are ; its so little sometimes just accidentally moving the cable will flip it around or something . But thats expected , and not that big of a deal if you 're careful . Now the one issue I really have with this pedal , its cosmetic so its not worth 4-starring this review ; but it did get to me . The knobs . They are not the cool chrome ones in these pictures . They are black plastic ones . They look sorta bland and not as cool , but ive noticed no functionality problems with them yet . Still a great product though .	1
This is my first amp , which I am using with my new Applause AE148-RRB Acoustic Electric Guitar ( also purchased from Amazon ) . The guitar sounds great when hooked up to this amp . My only complaint is that as a first time amp owner/user I needed a bit more help on how to adjust the settings and this product came with NO paperwork at all . Not sure if that is normal or if it was just omitted from the unit I received . I downloaded the users manual from the Pyle website but it was also not much help . But just by trying different settings I have managed to find what , for me , is the & # 34 ; sweet spot & # 34 ; for my guitar when paired with this amp . Very happy with the amp and also happy that I spent the extra few dollars to get the 60 amp rather than the 30 amp version .	1
This capo is easy to install and move and does not seem to pull the strings thus maintaining tune . Adjustment is easy and effective . The same company makes a tuning capo which I find handy at times .	1
Solid constructions with enough room for my sheet music . Very portable , though the holder can be a challenge at times . I have another stand that collapses into a very compact unit , but if you have heavy tomes that you wish to use or several sheets that you want to string ... this unit is superior .	1
How do you review an SM58 ? ? I 've used these most of my life , and will continue to . Very durable , I got this to replace the same , a 20 year old , rusted / dented grill 58 : ) I also use a D5 ( AKG - same price ) and a line 6 wirelesss , but the 58 is always reliable first choice or backup .	1
I used this along with a Dunlop DC adapter and it all fits nicely . I 'm powering a Zoom MS-50G and a Fulltone OCD . It will pay for itself over a year in saved battery costs .	1
This is a great pick for all those that use picks , but need a softer sound occasionally . Much easier than getting your fingers all tangled up . The only negative is the way they seem to be packed here . They come in three colors and the colors stand for soft , medium , hard . They also come in 3 and 5mm which is the size of the grip thickness ( where you grip the pick . ) The white is soft , the medium grey is medium , and the dark grey is hard . I use the white and medium grey in 3.1mm and find that easy to adjust too . They are soft and they do wear fairly quickly , but you just keep playing them or do a little cutting to sharpen them back up . You get a nice soft tone and , just like using any other plectrum , you develop a picking style to get various tones ( double bass , acoustic , finger style , etc . I use the soft picks for a smooth tone , and the medium pick for a deep jazzy sound ( think Motown . ) I never leave home without at least three of each in my gig bag.For a real trip , if you are able to finger pick , try out the Jam Cat pick holder sold here . It is so easy to switch from finger to pick in an instant and it is always there when you need to rock it up a bit .	1
You may have experienced the problems of musicians . The drummer is drunk and the rhythm guitar is late . But you need to rehearse . This gets the job done , you can lay down rhythm lines and drum lines and get the sound you want . The thing to remember is that whatever effect you are using for the lead , will kick in on any recording playback as they use the same input jack . Otherwise , easy and a great product . The best is , that if you are playing really poor lead work , nobody can hear but you ! lol .	1
Last forever and easy to hold onto . Not much more to say but there really isnt much more that needs to be said . My favorite picks .	1
Rugged , good looking , efficient ... sorta like me . Have several tuners of different names and quality . But this Seiko is certainly the quickest . The rubber housing is an excellent idea . Would buy another .	1
This item did the job it 's made for . Made well and you need to make sure you open it fully prior to inserting it onto your guitar neck to keep it from snapping back on you because it 's strong but it wo n't damage your guitar and it 's effective .	1
I love this little device ! I 'm an amateur musician so I 'm on and off on playing . I play enough I need to know theory , but not so often I do n't forget the specifics.This gizmo lets me refresh all of those pesky details with the slide of a tab.I do n't believe this is a tool to teach people music theory , but it is a wonderful reference once you know what you 're looking for.For example , I 'm playing with the harmonica now . Simple little instrument right ? Well that simple little instrument has you thinking about major , minor , major pentatonic , minor pentatonic , and blues scales in 12 different keys ! One section of this wheel lists all of these different scales . Rotate the dial to the key you 're interested in and the individual notes for each of these scales in the key you 've selected appears . Nice.Although I play guitar , I find the other side of the wheel less helpful . Yes it does show you how to play diatonic chords ( MmmMMmD ) but they are barre chords based upon the `` E '' chord . If you understand the formation of an E barre chord and its family ( E , Em , E7 , Esus , Esus4 , etc ) , this may not be so helpful . I really do n't use E barre chords much beyond the 7 fret as I usually switch to the `` A '' type barre chord based off of the 5th string so my hand has much less distance to travel . I 've not found anything to support these `` A '' type barre chords nor the others : D , G , C.I find the music theory side of the wheel worth the price and the disillusionment with the guitar side my be due to my ignorance .	1
The strings on my new Yamaha FG700S were too hard and noisy so I ordered these and what a difference in the feel ! Playing went from painful to pure pleasure ! I did notice that the tone of the low E string was a bit dead , especially in drop D tuning so I put that one Yamaha string back on and got better sounding lows . For that , I gave four stars instead of five .	1
This is a great microphone . It 's light , sensitive , and looks professional . I used this alongside my Xonar DG sound card and my recordings sounded clear even when boosted +22dB . I would recommend this for anyone looking to do amateur voice recording .	1
Ordered these guitar picks for my son . The picks were exactly as described . We ordered the blue color , which is dark blue with a lighter , shiner , blue design on top of it . It is a `` heavy duty '' grade and it is very sturdy . He is very pleased with these picks . The appearence is pleasing and it is made well - very pleased with the quality . We will be purchasing more picks in the future . Highly recommend !	1
I have tried coated strings in the past ( including Elixirs ) and have never been very fond of them . Whenever I tried them I felt a certain disconnect from my guitar . Somewhat reminiscent of wearing condom . Not that I hated them , just did n't really love them . These are the best ones I 've tried so far . I still do n't like them as much as regular strings but because of the type of gigs I mostly do these seem to be a reasonable trade off . If you need a longer lasting string for whatever the reason these are really the best out there . After a dozen or so gigs with them , they still sound the same as when I put them on .	1
Bought these as the studio I was using had a very rough , taped together set of headphones and they told me most people bring there own . Did a quick search for good quality studio quality headphones and settled on these for my choice . I am not disappointed . Excellent sound quality and I would pin them against Bose any day .	1
I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif , simple and easy set up , just plugged it in and it worked fine , no complaints . It 's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again . Well constructed pedal , a nice addition to my recording studio . This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif , that was my main concern when ordering . No other review stated that , so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things ... LOL ) ,	1
Unless you 're going to go for the very top of the line most expensive professional chords , these will do for any medium sized venue .	1
I 've needed one of these for my fender amp , yes I used to spend time dialing in the delay pedal for the rockabilly/blues numbers and if my settings got messed up , well , that would slow the show down . I wish my fender amp had this built into the amp but it did n't . This pedal makes playing rockabilly on my fender simple fast and easy . Really quick to setup and use . It 's not a delay unit , it 's not versatile either , but what it does , it does perfect !	1
I 've had a few of these things , not all the same model . This one was hard to read . I changed the battery and that helped out quite a bit . Overall I like it and use it on gigs instead of my pedal .	1
I have found that sometimes these cheapy ones tend to break fairly easily but these ones have lasted me a very long time . Hardly any breaks considering I get the thin ones .	1
At first I was skeptical of this nifty little tuner , but since I 've been using it for the past few weeks , I 've yet to have one complaint . It sits right atop , clipped to the guitar , operates on vibrations , so does n't pic up other guitars , is light , barely even notice it , and seems quite accurate .	1
very good slide smooth sound and reasonably priced I use it with my 12 stringer in open g tuning would buy other products from this company	1
I just bought a tweed Blues Jr. and love the amp . It 's got a great tone , much better than the black one I had 3-4 yrs . ago . I just downsized from a 40 watt Blues Deluxe reissue and having compared them side by side I can say they sound very , very similar , as they have the same speaker , but the BJ is much lighter.That being said the fat switch really makes a lot of difference when taking a solo . I was actually surprised at how much it fattens up the tone , did n't do that on my last one . This pedal works great for that too , It feels very solid and it does n't make any audible clicking noises that I can hear when engaging it .	1
I switched over to using an Android tablet for notation when playing music . All of my 7 & # 34 ; tablets fit and even my larger HP Touchpad fits . I ended up using an Ainol Fire as my regular tablet . It would be nice if there was just a tiny bit more tilt up but it does what it is supposed to and it fits securely on the mic stand .	1
I just got them ( I bought 5 ) and put them up , so I do n't know about longevity . So far , though , they work great and seem to be sturdy enough . And the price is great ! I am using them for a variety of instruments including steel string acoustic guitar , classical acoustic guitar , electric guitar , electric bass guitar ( 4 string ) , and mandolin . The hangers adjust easily while maintaining stability .	1
Pretty simple tool , did exactly what I needed it to for a decent price . I 'd order again if I needed another one !	1
Did n't purchase this pedal from Amazon , but wanted to write a review . I was n't expecting much from this pedal , but it is quite good . Is it a completely authentic acoustic sound ? I 'd have to say ... not exactly . But it 's kind of close , and it 's a far cry from lowering your volume and raising your master , which still sounds distinctly electric . So far , the setting with the most convincing acoustic tones would be the Jumbo setting . Again , do n't expect to sound completely acoustic -- it 's a nice way to at least approach that sound . Check out some Youtube tests before buying.It 's & # 34 ; okay & # 34 ; on my Blues Jr. NOS , but really shines on my Crate TD-35 , which is a brighter amp and less colored . I zero the spring verb and use the pedal 's onboard reverb for best results.Used it with my Strat and also a humbuckered guitar with a Duncan Hotrod set . Sounds good with both guitars -- especially neck and center positions.Pedal is solid . Be advised that it comes with the 9-volt from the factory , so if you use a DC power source then you 'll want to remove the battery . To do so , you 'll see a black knob at the base of the pedal . Just unscrew it , pop the hood , and remove the battery . Overally , solid pedal as you 'd expect from Boss.A word of warning . Not sure if it 's my setup , but when the AC-3 is in my effects chain ( not a loop , but in front of the Blues Jr ) , I started getting really bad static sounds that sounded like the amp was malfunctioning -- burnt tube or the like . When I run it alone to my Crate , I have n't experienced this . Could be any number of things in my effects chain , so check if others experience this.I 'm wondering if a small , cheap acoustic amp would help augment the acoustic tone with the pedal . Never tried running an electric into an acoustic amp . Not sure how a non-piezo pickup would affect the tone . Anyone know about this ?	1
Not a flashy strap but great in the studio or on stage when you need to change guitars fast.Light weight allows you to remove quickly.It is pretty comfortable to wear also .	1
Great universal power supply for your pedals , and the ability to mount it under your board makes it awesome . I have two of these that I mount under my board and they power all my pedals perfectly . Would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a unit to power all their pedals with , and you wo n't get any noise interference with its isolated outputs .	1
This thing sounds amazing- except for one small problem : At higher gain settings it hisses like a mother . I 'm not talking about extreme settings , just gain and & # 34 ; character & # 34 ; ( thats what Tech 21calls it- forgot what Joyo calls it ) at 3 o'clock . It has a beautiful WARM singing lead tone-better than any pedal that I have owned ( and that 's probably 20-30 distortion/overdrive pedals ) If only it did n't hiss so much it would be my main lead pedal . If you have a Rocktron Hush or other noise gate pedal , it is worth considering . The Joyo is an EXACT clone of the Tech 21British pedal , which costs $ 189 ( ? ) . I do n't know it the tech 21 has the same hissing problem or not .	1
Very nice product and fits well and good quality . It 's held up to my daughters abuse and recommend to everyone .	1
I have yet to find a pedal that can match this little guys desired effect ... ... If you know how to use it , it really delivers a good effect .	1
Great rack mount screws . Rubber washers are perfect , lets it give your item that tight fit without worry of the screws working out any time soon . I use them on my portable desktop rack with my mobile DJ equipment and they have held strong .	1
I 've been using this product for years now and it is truly outstanding . It provides a terrific slick feel to the fretboard and makes playing much easier and more enjoyable . Clean , no residue from repeated use , and the glide across the strings is super nice . I use it regularly on my USA Stratocaster maple neck and would n't leave home without it .	1
Purchased this tuner awhile back to be able to check my tuning periodically without having to access my in line tuner . This is a great tuner IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE USING IT FOR . With that being said , this little clip on is not intended for gig use per say . If that is what you are looking for , an inline tuner would be much more efficient and accurate . This little guy is best suited to practice ( if you are like me and do n't use your primary rig for at home practice and do n't feel like breaking out the old pedal chain ) it does the job and does it well . Now could you use it for a gig ? Sure I suppose so , but bear in mind that it is not an `` in-line '' tuner therefore any excessive background noise will cause the accuracy to be a bit off . For the price it ca n't be beat . It swivels ( although not much ) but enough that you can clip it on , read the nicely lit LCD and tune up quickly . Great product that every player should keep in the case with their guitar .	1
I own several Taylor acoustics , and a few other kinds of guitars . I bought the original pack of these from a suggestion of a friend who had a few acoustics damaged by humidity ( too dry ) . These are so easy to use , and can be & # 34 ; recharged & # 34 ; if you feel like $ 12-15 for 3 is too much every couple of months . I 've successfully recharged these using distilled water about 3 times now , and they work just as great as they did new . These also come in a resealable package , so you can recharge them and then store them until you need to replace the other set in guitar case.You can tell when they 've dried out by the fact they get crunchy feeling . It means they need to be replaced.To recharge them , I take a large ziplock plastic container with a lid ( big enough to hold 1 quart ) , and then pour a few cups of distilled water in the bottom . Next , I take a smaller empty ziplock container ( the bottom of one big enough to hold a sandwich ) , and float it on the water in the larger container . Then place the 3 packs in the floating container ( stacked on one another or on their sides ) and seal the top of the larger container with a lid . It traps the humidity in the container , and the membrane on these packs is two-way , so they absorb it until they reach capacity again .	1
For this review , I used the services of my super-musician friend , Mike . Thanks for the very thorough review , Mike ! ******************D'Addario XL Nickel WoundRegular Light Gauge EXL110Bright Round Wound.010-.046I installed these strings on a Schecter Diamond Serier Acoustic - Electric HybridC-1 E/A in order to test the sound using both acoustic and electric settings . The strings were easy to work with on installation.In particular , I liked the color coding of the strings vs the traditional individuallywrapped strings . The color coding makes it hard to accidentally mix similar strings and ismore environmentally friendly in terms of packaging . Also , the sealed packet wouldappear to keep the strings from oxidizing longer.The strings tuned up quickly and reached stable tuning within a very short time frame.After only about an hour they needed only slight tuning adjustment and were ready to go.First , I tried the Hybrid using a clean acoustic setting and the string produced a surprisingly nice range of sound , especially in the lower registers . This was a bit unexpected because of the `` bright '' label on the package . I actually prefer a widerrange of frequencies so this was a nice bonus . The highs were clean and bright.Using the Bernard Butler setting on the Line 6 Amp I tried the electric side of the Hybrid.The action of the strings was light and fast and notes could be comfortably bent . The sound produced was very similar to that of the more expensive strings that previously were on the guitar , which leads me to my closing point.Overall , I was very pleased with the performance of these strings and when you consider the fact that they only cost around $ 3 , D'Addario EXL110 's will be put in my `` Best Buy '' category for future purchases .	1
its a must have for guitarist with multi effects . it comes with a range of wires but I did not like that you camt use the last two ports together ( the ac ports ) . other than that it good	1
Replaced my beloved Small clone chorus with this pedal and I 'm glad I did . This is one lush pedal and it 's all analog . This pedal also sounds great with gain .	1
Easy to use , portable , cheap . Not exact in tuning , might want a more expensive one if you are a professional musican . For most of us this is more than adequate .	1
Play very mello . easy on my fingers too . Ca n't come close to understanding the differences of all the different style strings but these work great on My Taylor acoustic	1
My experience with these straps has been great . The polyester material is sturdy and comfortable , the leather post binding is sturdy and easy to use . The straps have PET/ABS buckles and are easily adjusted . I 've not experienced any issues with the buckles breaking.Note : It is possible that this material can become brittle if stored in high heat ( a car trunk or in sunlight within a hot car ) , but that problem is n't a manufacturing defect so much as a material deficit.For the price , the functionality is excellent . If you are looking for a product for an everyday use guitar , with little investment or maintenance , this is it .	1
For a Fender guitar bullets are the best choice for tone and longevity of strings . They seat snug and enhances sustain . Quality can be found behind the Fender name .	1
Comes with Adapter.This thing controls your tone so well ! ! ! ! ! Everything about it is just so much worth the money im starting to fall in love with MXR !	1
tremendous mic ! ! love the case and shockmount being all inclusive ... ..got it at great price and its a kick ass addition to my rather wimpy home/portable studio ... ..love recording my mom and musical friends and they dig singing into a quality mic ! ! ! I run it through an art tube preamp and it can make an unbelieveable hot signal without distortion and so very clear	1
If you are in a band or a sound guy for a band you got ta have one of these . The time and stress saved by not depending on trial and error to eliminate good/bad cable is priceless . Bottom line ! ! ! eliminate a variable and audio problems are faster and easier to solve .	1
This is a good quality strap ! It is wide and has leather ends . It fits my Les Paul 100 just fine and I am sure it willlast a long time with normal use.Ca n't go wrong for the price !	1
Schaller is sort of a household name among guitarists , because they 've been making the same product for so long now . You probably already know what this thing is and what it does . All my electric guitars are equipped with these .	1
I love this little guy . Clip it on and no matter how much noise is around you , it will still accurately tune the guitar . Very easy and simple to use . I paid $ 9 for it and it is 10 times better than the $ 40 one I have .	1
Very good guitar strap ! Thick nylon webbing material well sewn and the leather ends not only look sharp , they hold really well on your guitar studs.The tan color goes with with my natural finished guitar.I would recommend this strap to all !	1
Just needed a simple canvas bag to hold speaker stands on top of my pile of PA equipment on a cart . Aside from the two speaker stands , I can fit two mic stands and the bottom of a music stand . Very simple , sturdy canvas construction , thick zipper , two sturdy handles . I do n't expect to carry equipment around in it much more than to get on and off my cart , so I 'm assuming the stitching is more than sufficient . At $ 20 , this bag looks like a great value .	1
I 've been playing D'Addario XLs in their standard .010 , .011 and .013 gauge sets for many years now , so I was curious to see how these new `` balanced '' sets would feel . I expected a more even feel across the fingerboard , but experienced something quite different- right off , the B string felt a lot stiffer . Looking at the tension table D'Addario publishes it 's clear why this is the case . In the traditional .01s , the B string has about 30 % lower tension that the E and G. In these new sets , the B is at the same tension , which is to say it 's under 40 % more tension than the B in the traditional set . That 's a significant increase . If you 're used to the lower tension , the `` balanced '' tension feels a lot stiffer at first.The higher tension string requires a different amount of compensation at the bridge , too , which means changing the setup- not easily done on a Telecaster , where changing the length of the B changes the length of the E as well . Being higher in tension , the new B should require more compensation , since it 'll shift pitch even more when you depress/stretch it . Since my Tele is currently set up as close as I could get the E and B to perfect comnpensation , I did n't feel like playing with it.After playing a while , the set started to feel more natural to me . I do n't think I 'll be changing gauges on the Tele right away , as I have about a dozen .010s in stock as well as over a dozen .013s fro my archtop . But I may experiment a bit with the new gauges for my Epiphone Dot Custom , which I string with .011s . I 'm wondering if the balanced sets will give me a more even string-to-string feel , and if so , it would be worth my effort to change over .	1
Amazingly sturdy for the $ . It is n't as sturdy as some , but it probably is the sturdiest of the truly collapsible stands . It folds up very nicely . I 'd buy it again .	1
IT does the job as described it though . I have no complains and the cheap price was a plus for me .	1
This little foot stool is really sturdy . It stays in place beautifully . No rocking sideways , no wobbly action.If one of the notches does n't do it for you , you 're screwed : There 's no gradual adjustment . But the positions it allows make sense for 99 % of players .	1
Exceptionally well made , this is a fantastic case for the money . ( Fifty dollars , including shipping , at the time of my purchase . ) It has four ( ! ) very solid clasps , one of which locks . ( Two keys are included . ) It also features a plush velvet interior , cushioned neck brace , and a strap to keep the top from flopping back , which could stress the hinges and perhaps alter the factory-perfect lid to case alignment . But best of all , it fits my Takamine Jasmine guitar like a glove , holding it secure and ( knock on wood ) keeping it safe from all harm . I could not be happier .	1
I 'm happy enough with this , it looks okay and fits properly so what more could you ask for . Good deal .	1
These picks are perfect . They are just the right feel for medium and look awesome . What more can you say about picks other than they are perfect .	1
Nice to see something well made for a change . Most guitar straps I see that are less than $ 80.00 are all cheap and that fake stuff .	1
Got mine for under 130 , and it 's a great Mic . I can use it for vocal tracks , or recording for webcasts that kind of thing , or recording studio guitar sounds etc . Awesome mic .	1
Always the best string I buy . I like the Martin coated as well but I prefer the elixer . This is the first set I baught for my electrics but so far so good .	1
I play Progressive and Thrash metal , and these strings hold out nicely . Tuned them down to A sharp ( b flat ? ) and they sounded sweet . Back up to E ( standard ) and they provide nice full sounding tone .	1
I had sworn off Chorus pedals years ago , the sounded so sterile and digital the sucked the tone out your guitar and amp and made everything sound the same . Not with the MXR Analog Chorus , very musical and transparent , I like the presets recommended in the instruction manual . the stereo out is very cool for using two amps . and of course it is an MXR so it is built like a tank and will last forever . By the way this is the exact same pedal as the Zak Wylde chorus pedal with out all the cheese paint job , not all of us are metal heads	1
I use this all the time for acoustic guitar/banjo/mandolin , as well as an autoharp and my daughter 's fiddle . I 'll be getting another one soon for her to keep in her fiddle case ( wanted to teach her the basics of tuning by ear first or from another instrument like a piano or keyboard ) . This works well at a noisy jam and rarely gets confused . For my acoustic guitars it lets me easily tune to open G even if it 's too noisy for me to hear it but it almost always stays in my mandolin case and gets used often for banjo as well . I 've used it to tune my girlfriends autoharp and although the clip is stretched pretty wide it still does the job.Nobody really gets excited about tuners , but I 've been playing a long time and nothing like this was around that I know of when I started out . If you wanted to tune and did n't have a 1/4 '' input , good luck .	1
Good cheap basic metal slide , sounds like it should . Only problem is I prefer to wear it on my ring finger but I have big hands ( viz XL and XXL gloves ) and the slide is too small to fit except on my little finger . A bit annoying but not the slide 's fault I guess !	1
Took away my fingerprints and dust off my guitar and polished it to a shine that you could n't see a reflection in yourself !	1
I like purchasing the 3 pack because I have multiple guitars and these were replacement strings . You ca n't beat the price . I have started purchasing a lot of my guitar supplies this way .	1
This is a really nice strap . It 's very thick and feels like it 's well made and high quality for a non-bank breaking price on a strap . Looks cool and vintage , I am a fan of many Dunlop products and this one does not disappoint at all .	1
What makes it better is that it is a kit with most of what you need to power up to 8 pedals . It comes with various adapters and even has rubber caps to cap of the power outlets you arent using ! Powers pedals that have negative tip -like boss , maxon , ibanez , etc , etc . Even has one reverse adapter for an oddball positive tip pedal ! Also adatper to connect your battery only pedal by connecting to the battery clip ! ! ! One of the best features is that the power plugs are at right angles so they do n't stick straight out on pedals that have side jacks ... takes up less room on your pedal board . Also the 8 plugs stretch further out than most other daisy chain cables.The other great feature is the power capacity is greater than boss..it can put out up to 1700mA ... which is how it can run up to 8 pedals.A great item at a great price . No brainer solution for anyone with a few pedals or more .	1
Holds my picks but if i move it to another part of my guitar it tends to have trouble sticking unless i force it on the guitar	1
These are solid , good build quality and really do get the job done well.Easily adjustable , versatile in design and function , get em !	1
I started playing mandolin back in September and bought a lot of different picks to try to find the type that would work best for my playing , and finally decided on the Dunlop Jazz Stubby 3.00mm picks . Once I determined that it was the best pick for me it was an easy decision to buy a package of them so that I wo n't ever be without one . Picks have a habit of disappearing just when you need them most -- buying them in bulk this way means that I 'll always have them available and can even share them with others if the opportunity arises .	1
Just what I needed to position my guitar while seated . I was worried it would not hold the weight , but it does well .	1
We bought three of these and they are just great . Mounting holes are drilled right , screws pass right through and fit perfectly . Comes with big , beefy drywall anchors and feels just right . Holds the guitar out at a safe distance . Highly recommend this over the other ( way cheaper looking ) ones that are a few bucks less . Spend the extra few bucks on these and SMILE .	1
This original plug fits the purpose perfectly ! Quality and precision ! The plugs do n't take up space ( could n't be smaller ) and the wiring is pliable and easy to rout in and out of spaces on your pedalboard . Keep away from the cheap imitations that rob you of space and are hard to work with ! Make sure what you receive is a One Spot product in its original packaging ( check images ) .	1
Looks good . Great quality for such a low price . Fits the instrument , ( and old Mexican acoustic ) , and feels comfortable . They arrived before the promised delivery date .	1
These microphones have a quality-feel to them and they all worked perfectly . I used them with my Harbinger HA60 PA system and I was not disappointed . They do n't come with cables so be sure you have some available ( xlr-xlr ) . You can get a 25 ' cable for under $ 5 also here on Amazon . Good deal all around . Would not hesitate to purchase more of them if I need to .	1
I would n't consider this a $ 30 backup mic , I would consider this a professional vocal mic . Period . This is a great mic ! Out of the box , it has a nice weight to it . It sounds slightly hotter than say , a Shure SM58 ; which is why I like it so much . I typically like to stand back from a mic when I sing live and this seems to work very well for my vocals with that technique . I have also tested this mic with harmonica as well . Seriously ... I do n't work for the company or have any ties whatsoever . I 'm just a dude in a band . Trust me on this one .	1
This microphone stand it a fairly good buy . Because it is a light and portable stand , it is not built to be fully extended with microphones , such as the Behringer XM1800S . Adding a counter weight maybe needed if you have a heavier condenser microphone . I found that I needed to line up one of the legs directly under the boom when it was fully extended . As it stands , I would suggest this as a fairly good deal .	1
These are sturdy , just the right length , and the design means that you can save space in arranging your effects pedals , with enough length and flexibility to arrange them in a semicircle if , like me , you have a lot of pedals .	1
When I ordered these I was n't expecting a whole lot since the price was under two dollars for a nearly 10-foot cable . It turns out the quality is quite excellent and these cables are not flimsy at all . I plugged them into the mixer and waited to hear some static , interference or buzz to explain the low price and all I got was a nice , clean signal . Highly recommend these to anyone with a mixer that needs an insert cable .	1
As is the case with all tools , you really do get what you pay for with this string cutter . It 's extremely well-built , and performs its task very well.Pros : - Extremely high quality metal- Comfortable rubber grips- Red accent handle makes it easy to find in a bag-of-tricks- Effortlessly cuts even stainless steel bass stringsCons : - Has no ability to lock the cutter closed for storage ; the tool is spring-loaded to open . While this may be a plus for some people , I find it less than ideal.Overall , this is an extremely well-made tool for your guitar kit . If you 're a bassist that likes stainless steel strings , you 'll appreciate how they cut like butter .	1
works very smoothly and does n't eat batteries like the foot pedal types of tuners . We have a local place that sells the batteries for this in a 5 pack for $ 1.00 ( yep a buck ) . I 'm sold on these and will be getting another as soon as I need one	1
I have a few tuners that are somewhat like this GT-1 Clip-on Tuner . However this is the best one I have because of the format of the Clip-on Tuner GT-1 . The size of the Clip-on GT-1 one is also great . So far the tuner is very accurate . in conclusion I would like to say that the Clip-on GT-1 is a good quality . However I could have got this product for a lot cheaper !	1
Still using it today , 2 years later .	1
I was hesitant to purchase this , as I really like the display of the previous models . At first it seems like it might be less accurate . It has less granularity in the display for example . However , it does seem to respond noticeably faster . It appears to be a bit more sensitive and better at tuning bass notes . And it may in fact be more precise , though it takes learning how to work with the display.On earlier Snarks , the display has individual tiny gradients for each cent of pitch above or below the note . And they seemed pretty dead on , especially if you tune from the harmonic at the middle of the string . But I also found that the note would occasionally stall briefly causing me to over-tune . ( Though once you get used to it , it is easily avoided . ) Anyway , on this unit , I am not sure what each bar represents , but it is very sensitive . If the string is not quite perfect , the `` On pitch '' bar will be lit up , but so will one next to it . Then a slight turn of the tuning peg will bring it right on . Then only the `` On pitch '' bar will be lit ( unless you turn too far ) . And the result sounds really right . I think I 'll be putting one of these on most instruments from now on .	1
I was very skeptical to buy a Wuhan china because ive had bad experiences before and their quality control is almost non-existent.That being said , the china I received is amazing its a nice thick little cymbal and has a great sharp tone and fast decay.My opinion of Wuhan has been raised quite a bit .	1
The grip is excellent . But I prefer the 1.14 Sharps over these . These are sturdy and look like I wo n't be needing another set for quite some time	1
For the price and the fast shipment ( despite a notice that said it would take 2 months to ship ) it is well worth the money . Does what it 's supposed to do so far . I can imagine that a lot of use may eventually wear out it 's springiness but for now it is working great for my needs . I do n't capo too much , just getting into learning some new songs that require it so cheap was the way to go for me . I could see someone who capo 's a lot might want to look elsewhere but if you 're only needing something simple and cheap , look no further .	1
I bought 2 of these as controllers for my Alesis drum machine . One starts/stops the drum pattern and the other triggers the fill and change pattern from A to B . These things stay put and work every time .	1
These are great strings and were my favorite until I found Fender Pure Nickel strings . Some may like the sound of these some may like the Pure Nickel	1
The threads can sometimes come undone slightly and make you itch if they come in contact with skin , but it 's still a great strap and holds up solidly . Would certainly buy again .	1
Ernie Ball is the standard for guitar strings . I tried switching to some other strings for a few years such as the GHS boomers and D'Addario . I have to say , I only had a pack of Slinky Strings during my last setup and I 'm glad that 's what I used because they play great and sound amazing .	1
Makes changing strings a whole lot easier . If you are a guitar player and are changing strings like I was without one of these , stop and get one trust me !	1
If you like thick/heavy gauge picks , but find they wear too fast for you , this is the pick for you . They have a very solid grip to them and are very stiff , but also wear ( as in do n't wear down ) like nothing else . These were a very nice find !	1
This bench is well constructed and comfortable to sit on for extended periods . My only complaint is that I wish it had just a little more height adjustment- maybe 1 inch . Overall , it is well suited for most unless you are tall or a small child .	1
I 've been playing guitar for over 25 years and been through many different style of tuners . This is by far the best I 've ever had . Not only is it accurate and easy to use , but it 's so convenient ! Simply clip it to the head of the guitar , press the only button on the unit and start tuning . Also , unlike other tuners I 've used , this tuner does a great job of filtering/ignoring ambient noise in the room . I can actually tune my guitar while having a conversation , even with the TV on in the room ! Pro 's : - Vibrant , easy to read display- No need for cords , chargers even when used on electric guitars/bass.- Simple one button activation- Lightweight - I leave it on my classical guitar all the time , especially after restringing.- Auto Shutoff ( also can manually shut it off , just press the one button a second time ) - Works for Guitar and Bass ( both acoustic and electric ) and violin - Also works on my Ukulele ! Con 's : Wish I had this 20 years ago ! Bottom Line : This is a no-brainer . The price , quality and easy of use make it a must have for any guitarist .	1
Cables are cables . They usually all work . And with Amazon , you will always find the best deals for the same quality .	1
i like it as the stars say ... great for around the house playing , but lately i noticed it does cut out on me ... when you strum it shuts down somrtimes , i am not sure if it is the battery or it just does not like the song i am playing ... when you turn it back on it usally works fine ... some other people have made the same discovery also ... but for $ 20 ... i 'm going to live with it , ,has a belt clip if you want to look really silly playing ... i just glued it to my pelvis ! ! !	1
I had for years been using Elixir Strings on myWashburn D10simply because I was accustomed to them and saw no sense in making a switch . I 'm glad I tried out these D'Addario strings . These strings are an excellent complement to my Washburn , which has mellowed out over the years . They are a fair bit cheaper but has a tonal quality that rivals that of the Elixir strings . I ca n't speak to the manufacturers claim of `` 4 times more life , '' but as of now , I 'd have to say these strings are a fantastic value for your money . Highly recommended .	1
In my opinion it does not hurt to have extra guitar cables around . From experience they tend to just die without notice . I have a feeling this one will last a long time . It is built sturdy and sounds really good.I recommend this product .	1
These picks far exceed my expectations , I mean how good could a pick be anyway ? These are the classiest , nicest looking picks I own . They look great , feel great and play great . Call me a snob , but I wanted these to match my Fender Stratocaster . Kind of like using a GM part on my 68 Chevelle..If you own a Fender and want to spend just a few bucks for a & # 34 ; feel good & # 34 ; gift to yourself , buy these.I love the color and texture too , they do n't slip or move around as you play .	1
just to let people know off the bat i can tell you these picks are small , and if you are used to big picks these might turn you off for a while . But trust me when i say that once you get used to these picks and you start using proper technique these picks will improve your technique rapidly.i never thought i would say that a pick helped me improve playing but it does . now when i try any bigger pick i even use those picks with more skill now because of these picks . trust me if you put up with these picks for a while and you get used to them you will improve or at least i and many other people agree . : D	1
Works amazingly so far . I am definitely proud of this product . Will be buying more in the future . Great Buy ! ! !	1
I can become VERY creative with this pedal and do a good many things in a great many settings.I have other musicians online who jam with me and I can really do more than a handful of things in showing them where I am going with a song.So many things I have developed.Great tool and good quality product .	1
Works well since I got it . I did n't change battery for more than 6 months .	1
I accidently ordered two of these , which proved fortunate because one did not have a battery when it arrived at my APO in Afganistan , where watch batteries are hard to come by . That being said , This is the most user friendly little tuner I have ever owned . I do n't have a particularly good ear , but I can tell when I am out of tune , and I have struggled with other tuners in the past trying to get just the right tune . I bought this for a brand new backpack guitar , and I had the guitar tuned up in less than 5 minutes after I clamped this tuner on the neck . These are cheap enough to buy one for every guitar and keep it in the case .	1
this pickup for the price is just as good as one that cost 4 tom 5 times as muchif your looking for one that wont break your bank but sounds good this is the one	1
Capos are a funny thing , there are some that work great and many that are n't so great . My capos include , Bird of Paridise , Paige , and Kyser . This is a very fast and easy capo to use , the tension adjustment is fast and easy . If you need an all around capo for a six string guitar , this is it .	1
Makes my guitar look great , from the fretboard , strings and body . Everything conditioned and polished . Great quality product , highly recommend	1
Really great quality item . It was delivered fast and there was no difficulty setting it up . It 's durable and I suspect will last me for the rest of my days .	1
I love these picks . Great for lead playing , and with small fingers like I have , they feel great ! Nice quality pick .	1
I installed these on a Silvertone SD10 , which is a dreadnought acoustic guitar . They are so much nicer than the strings that were on my guitar from the factory . If you are looking for a regular/medium string , these are real nice . Great product .	1
While it is just a stand , it seems to be sturdy and durable . Nothing special about it , but also no negatives that I can find either , than the fact that it does n't give my foot massages . XD	1
I love this guitar strap button . It 's a great alternative to the invasive buttons that have to be screwed in . I actually purchased it for my newMahalo U-35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pink . It works well for it 's stated purpose and appears to be of high quality . The leather is nice and soft and the button fits snuggly into the leather hole . Check out my user name stinkylungs on Youtube to see a video I made of me installing it on my new uke if you want to see it up close .	1
Awesome for $ 10 . Accurate with TV on in the background . This thing is just sweet , I just love it . Easy no-brainer .	1
In my opinion , D'Addario is the standard by which all other strings are measured . I keep trying different brands from the cheap to the boutique , and I always keep coming back to D'Addario . Extremely versatile , stable and they last as long as can be reasonably expected of any non coated string .	1
the mini amp did not arrive with the battery as it was stated in literature . good thing I had purchased the 9volt power adapter . I was really surprised at the output considering how small the speaker size . ideal for kicking aound house and small partyof friends . should already come with 9volt adapter with along cord . it would be worth the increase in price to have it come altogether . would purchase again ,	1
This is a great case that came TWO WEEKS earlier than the arrival date . In came in good packaging and I found no flaws when inspecting it . My Jasmine fits snugly inside of it , no bumping whenever I carry the case . The only problem I have is it smells terrible ! But that 's fine ; I just left it open on the deck for two days and the smell is not noticeable . Other than that , this was a great investment !	1
this is very inexpensive and works great for my home- wan na be purposes . it is not superloaded with heavy delay , etc . but it definitely gives you the effect . it links well with other pedals . the Battery wears out pretty quick and it does not come with a 9 v plug in . therefore , I would recommend spending a couple of bucks and get a standard 9V plug in on Amazon or at a local electronics store and not worry about the batteries always going dead.I like it enough that I will probably get a few more of this company 's petals as the effect is good and the price is right.for my limited purposes , this works great . if you are a pro gigging or on the road , you probably want to get a more versitile , heavy duty and expensive delay petal .	1
I bought this to tune my 12-string without using the end jack . The headstock is angled back the adjustments that this screen makes have made it easier to see and it is sensitive enough & # 8220 ; feel & # 8221 ; the tone of each string with only minor plucking . I use it on Chromatic but it includes : Bass , Uke and Guitar too .	1
Thee only flatwound strings I 've tried that sound significantly better than these are the Thomastiks , which cost twice as much , and they 're not twice as good . Maybe if I was a working pro I 'd buy the Thomastiks , but for me , the D'Addarios sound good , and last a long time.If you 've never played flatwounds , you might be surprised to discover that they far outlast round wound strings . That 's because what kills the sound of strings is gunk from your fingers and the air getting in between the windings and damping the vibration . Back when guitar strings were more a lot more expensive , it was n't that unusual to remove strings , boil them , and put them back on . Some electric bassists still do this . ) With flats , the gunk does n't get in between the wraps , and if you do n't break a string you can play a set for months.I have different guitars set up with different strings ranging from .010s ( my Fenders ) to .013 ( my archtop . ) Rockers playing .010s and .009s might be intimidated by .013s , but they 're not that much harder to play , and after a little practice it 's easy . Jazzers seldom if ever play six-string bar chords or bend strings , which means you just do n't need that much muscle anyway . Flatwounds are also generally set with a fairly low action . They do n't vibrate as widely as roundwounds , so they do n't need as much clearance.If you 're looking for that classic electric jazz guitar sound , flats are the way to go , and the D'Addarios are as good as you need . ( Rockers looking for that 60s sound might try the D'Addario flatwound .010s . Almost the same sound as the Pyramids , and a lot cheaper . )	1
Only reason i gave it four stars is it is advertised to lean back and mine does not . but it sounds great as ampeg always has , heavy duty built perfect for house jamming and practice amp .	1
Great little amp , but get a tube amp if you 're serious about playing guitar . It will sound a lot better and it 's not too much more expensive . Solid state just is n't the same.I 'll also say that it 's quite difficult to get a natural sound out of this amp without a lot of tweaking . Even then , you wo n't get a great clean tone . The Fender Champ X2 is a great alternative to the more expensive and desiralble vintage Fender Vibro Champ . Go with Quality and save yourself a future purchase ( resale vale is great on the X2 as well ) .	1
This is another great product by D'Addario - I have used several tuners like the regular Snark ( several versions ) , the Snark S1 Mini Clip ( also known as 'Son of a Snark ' ) , the Planet Waves Headstock Tuner , the Peterson SC-1 Strobo Tuner , the Korg HTB-1 and the Q7 Chromatic Headstock Tuner . This D'Addario Micro NS Tuner tops all those with ease . It is super easy to use and more precise than all the others ( compared using several tuning computer softwares and the Korg Pitchblack floor pedal on my tests ) . The rotation feature is great and the visual metronome feature comes very handy , like when programming a delay pedal with more precision . The clip that holds the tuner to the guitar is very good , holds very well to your guitar headstock ( does n't matther the brand ) and with stay snug there without damaging your guitar 's finish . It is very light and you will hardly know it 's there once playing - Highly recommended . Cheers !	1
I 've had this pedal for about five years . I own a bunch of other overdrive pedals , including the Boss SD-1 , TS-9 , a Klon clone , and a bunch of DIY pedals . The Bad Monkey is cool for a couple of reasons . First is the bass and treble controls . Most overdrive pedals only have one tone control , the Bad Monkey lets you sculpt both the highs and lows . Second is the mixer out . Not everyone will appreciate this feature but it allows you to jack the pedal into a mixer or audio interface with a `` speaker sim '' .The gain sound is ok , but what I do is use it as a boost by diming the output and turning the gain all the way down which slams my tube amp giving me a natural tube overdrive . This pedal will work best with a tube amp but some people may dig the gain tone on a solid state.It 's built like a tank . Ca n't go wrong for the price , IMO .	1
I have three of these straps more my Strats . Very comfortable and durable . I really like the metal link as opposed to the plastic link which hold the strap itself to the the leather button hole . Great product !	1
This was a great purchase . My son found exactly what he needed and at a price he could afford . He would definitely purchase from here again .	1
VERY VERY loud electric guitar amp ! As a bass player , I was shocked that 40W could be that loud for guitar . I ca n't raise the volume above 1 in my house . When you switch it to acoustic or bass mode , the volume decreases dramatically , but it is a great amp for guitar players who also play bass occasionally.Excellent top quality features . Beautiful sound for each of the different modes . The acoustic setting really made my cheap electric guitar SOUND like it was an actual acoustic . The amp simulation is top notch.Awesome value for the price ! Edit : I 've played through it more as a bass amp and after turning some dials and trying out the different settings ... .I 'm even MORE impressed . One of the reasons the volume for bass was so much lower was that the default gain is at zero . I brought the pre and post gain up to a reasonable level and BOOM ... .huge sound . I play with a 18 piece dance band and usually bring my Hartke kickback for that group . After experimenting more , I would not hesitate to use the Peavey for rehearsals and performances with that band.I still ca n't get over the fact that it is a 40W amp . The sound is enormous and clean for that much wattage .	1
If you want to do swells with your instrument , or make notes & # 34 ; cry & # 34 ; , this ' will do the trick . Smooth , reliable action and no noise too .	1
It works great , not much I can say beyond that .	1
These just happen to be my favorite.I always keep .46mm .60mm and .73mm sizes on hand . ( mostly use the .60 's ) I 've been using them for years and so will probably never change . I like the 'grippiness ' of them ... . I hate smooth picks.Picks are cheap so just keep trying different ones until you find one you like .	1
When I 'm in a apt . I need an amp with tube ( at least the pre ) and a cabinetOrange PPC108 1x8 '' Speaker Cabinetas small as possible , giving a decent sound and output ( w/o annoying around ) and Orange made my needs true ! ( I never ever expect to play at a stadium with this ! Obviously ) In my opinion , this is absolutely a decent Amp that respond to precise needs .	1
This jumper cable is a decent cable used for jumping from one unit to another when longer connections are required & a 10 ft. cable is too long . I would not depend on it for night after night abuse but , it just may last longer than I think . Planet Waves does make good products .	1
Cables are good , my only complaint is the connectors . The 1/4 & # 34 ; is not too bad at all , but the XLR end looks and feels cheap . I guess that 's because they are cheap . Very good price and good performance . No wierd signal buzz like other cables in this category . Overall , 4 stars !	1
I purchased this to replace my other adapter that did n't work . Whereas , this does the job . I 'm happy I purchased this and did n't have to invest in purchasing 9V batteries every time I wanted to play guitar .	1
Yes , you are paying a little extra for peace of mind and the reputation of Mogami gold quality . I found this to be a good investment if you are meticulous about your sound . Compared to my old cable , the Mogami Gold produced a more transparent sound ... you might have to do a side by side comparison to get the idea . When recording guitar , I am able to clearly hear individual strings while playing overdriven chords . No matter your playing style , this cable will work well with your sound .	1
Sturdily holds three guitars . Fits everything from my bass , to the acoustic or electrics , to the mandolin/ukulele , to the harmonicas in the case.Folds up for transport . Pretty adjustable too.I bought this after buying two of the single guitar stands from Hercules . I also have the trombone and sax/clarinet stand from them . All A+ at reasonable prices .	1
I bought this in a few colors so my other reviews are on as well . I like the thickness of this pick . Easy to hang onto when strumming . Love the tone I can obtain too .	1
Best distortion i ever used . It took me a while but i finally got that Preriphery / Protest The Hero Tone with this Plus my overdrive	1
Great strap for the price . Absolutely no complaints/issues at all . Light weight but sturdy . I was able to put strap locks on this strap with no issues and it works great . Comfortable as well .	1
This is fine as a general stick-on inexpensive pick holder . It does n't hold very many picks , but it really does n't have to . I would give this five stars except that I really prefer the Planet Waves LED key chain/pick holder over this . It costs more but has more functional value to me . If all you need is something very simple , and you have a surface you can stick it on , then this is fine .	1
Although this light is a little pricey in my opinion , it really gets the job done . I do like the fact that you can use batteries or a/cadapter to power the light . The nine led 's really light up my music stand . The carrying case that comes with it is well made & makestransportation & keeping it stored easy.R . Joyner	1
There are some things in this life that you do n't want to have to think about , and your tuner is one of them . You have enough to think about on stage without worrying about your tuner . It is fast , reliable and looks great on the pedal board . It is true bypass and does n't add a bit of noise nor suck any tone at all . Your brand preference will guide your decision , but do n't shy away from this well-made piece of equipment . I would buy it again .	1
I do own a few Behringer pedals and many are very good sounding for their price range , and this pedal will stay in my collection.I 've spent $ 200+ for a few of my pedals , but I order and try many other pedals within the same effects range , because some I believe are just to costly for what you get , and the sound quality usually are not that far apart.I would put this pedal in that category . This is my 1st compressor pedal and while I dint think I really needed this type of pedal , for the price I thought I would give it a try ... WOW ! The Behringer DC9 Dynamics Compressor Pedal greatly enhances the sounds of every other pedal on my pedal-board , plus I get a volume control knob that allows me to drop my amp output level to below where to amp is set . So I can go quiet on an apartment at late hours , with a 100 watt amp , that 's nice.So I would say the majority of people will absolutely love this pedal .	1
This pedal sounds great with my fender excelsior with it 's 15 inch speaker and also very good with my 1960 's danelectro tweed amp with it 's bright weber ceramic 8 inch speaker . I can use the entire range of the tone knob to go from aggressive growls at the low end to screaming lead tones at the other end , and it never sounds harsh . The clipping is sweet and musical , with a sound very reminiscent to cranked amplifier stacks with their front ends being pushed with overdrive pedals . Sometimes I feed this with my SD-1 or my Danelectro D-2 overdrive and it just puts it over the top . FOR THE PRICE , these pedals are outstanding . The QC may not be perfect , and there are duds out there , but I would say that it is worth the risk , as the circuits in these are just like vintage pedals although they do use cheaper components and boards and such . As long as you dont literally stomp down on the pedal and you dont drop it down the stairs , it will last long enough to make it worth your while . Also , the blue LED is somewhat bright and annoying , but it is a good indicator so I guess it does it 's job . Overall , rock on !	1
Not every tune needs tremolo I grant you , but when you need one , this will do the job and them some . Simple controls . The LED pulses with the beat of the unit giving you a visual of the unit 's settings at all times . 100 % silent switching . In a FX loop , there 's not a trace of hiss , hum , or noise in any form . In a chain running into an amp 's input , there is a slight volume increase . Not much , but a little . No big deal really , unless you 're a real tone freak . There is no change in tone or any form of loss when in use . Being a true bypass , it changes nothing when off either . The box is ultra solid . The jacks are all metal . The switch is stout . In short , this is a solid performing pedal that gives a nice clean , warm , tremolo that can not be beat at three times the cost of this unit . It it anchored to my board ! It is not going to come off because it 's that good . Besides , how can you turn down a deal like this and get a pedal that has a crouching pitbull on it ? ? ?	1
These strings I put on my Taylor GA4E . They had a very nice and balanced mids and highs . These strings fit very nicely for a acoustic guitarist that is playing with a bassist and supporting instruments . These strings fill and fit the acoustic spectrum nicely . Nice mids and ringing highs . Not a lot of bass . But very nice balance as I said . YMMV .	1
This strap is very well made . The leather is real thick and stiff which make is very unlikely to come off your guitar . Very happy with this low cost strap .	1
For me , I can click this in so it is a nearly perfect height . The padding is great , it is lightweight without feeling cheep .	1
This is a pretty nice and well built lite weight guitar stand but I have another that is a bit nicer and I paid about the same for both . This particular stand is surely made for a very large jumbo guitar .	1
I bought this strap because I thought the pattern was awesome ! The comfort is okay , I never wear it for more than a couple hours at a time . But ... just the design man , go planet waves !	1
These strap pins are fantastic . They securely hold the strap on your guitar very nicely . The oval shape is perfect . There is no need for proprietary or expensive `` strap locks '' . They are easy to install . These elliptical pins are great . Terrific yet simple concept . They also look great ! I highly recommend these to anyone who has a guitar . I will never use strap locks again after trying these . Great value .	1
Bought a Takamine 40 years ago . It was an exceptional guitar for which I paid $ 125 . Adjusted for inflation , that would be $ 800 when I bought this Jasmine.I got a superb machine for the money . Simply superb . It 's not my old Takamine , but the negative differences are slight , and there are only two of them three days into my acquaintance with this guitar.The first is that the finish is not as good . The sanding between coats was skimped , which means that the finish on the front has some texture ; the sides of the guitar are also a bit rough.The second probably flows from the first . The tone is a touch wooden ; it does n't sing as the old Taka did.Positives : the intonation is true at the twelfth fret , and it is playable ( and enjoyable to play ) with a slide . After the first tune-up of the strings , it stayed in tune.For its price , this guitar is a superb introduction to playing.A very young child , or a small woman , will find this guitar a bit large and deep for true playing comfort . For everyone else , it should fit pretty comfortably.The intonation is true at the twelfth fret , and it is playable ( and enjoyable to play ) with a slide . After the first tune-up of the strings , it stayed in tune.Any beginner , and more than a few cost-sensitive intermediate players , will be pleased with this guitar .	1
Not much to screw up . Good quality parts , on an essential product . Brain-dead simple install . And no surprises ; works like a champ !	1
I was a bit skeptical at first to purchase this . But its a nice cable ! No noise or hum whatsoever !	1
Have not had the chance to stick it to my guitar . So it is just used as a pick holder so my picks have some places to go . Can hold up to 11 picks of .50 thickness . I use Tortex Guitar Pick of that thickness .	1
I have tried many picks in my 25+ years of guitar playing and this one is by far the best . I have been using Dunlop for the most recent years , but these are the best . The Carbon Fiber of these Dunlop Jazz III make them as long lasting as you want - when playing rock ( slides and picking ) they are better than any other material , and still very comfortable for softer rythms and styles like blues or jazz . Their grip is excellent and they feel awesome . Got ta try them ! Highly recommended . Cheers !	1
Wow ! This little amp packs tons of tone & sound . Hundreds of presets that are going to take some time to explore fully . The clean channels are really clean & the dirty channels are just plain nasty . 75 watts is enough power to blow your socks off . Lots of bang for the buck here .	1
I really like this tuner but it is kinda bulky . Very obvious . Calls a lot of attention to itself , all GIANT and red.Still , I ca n't fault it 's tuning prowess . It 's quick and pretty on the money . It replaced my Roland Boss Tu-12h.Well more handy for tuning my sweet La Patrie nylon strung & # 34 ; Motif & # 34 ; Would buy again , but I 'd really prefer a more subdued color .	1
This is my second set of these . I bought the 1st set in the 1980 's and I 'm still using them on the guitar that they matched . ( black hardware ) . I was impressed with the quality of the 1st set and the 2nd set is just as good . Money well spent .	1
All I wanted was a simple tuner ... that 's what this is . If you just want something cheap and basic with only one button then this product is perfect . Pros : Works fast/accurate and can recognize full chromatic scale . Cons : Built with cheap plastic so it may break if continually dropped . Also , tends to get confused when there is interference from other instruments in a loud room . FYI : Snark makes more complex tuners ( Which are actually cheaper on amazon ) that also have 3 or 4 extra features .	1
These are the standard in guitar strings - they are well made , play nicely and are the size that most guitars come with from the factory.Do they have every bell and whistle modern strings come with ? Are they hand-wound ? Are they made with exotic materials ? No to all the above . These are a high quality no-frills set that is acceptable to everyone from beginners to the most accomplished professional.These days they make everything from coated strings of various colors , to pure nickel to pure stainless steel in almost every mix and match gauge imaginable . If you are n't a beginning guitarist you probably are n't reading this review , because you 've already played a set of these . You are off playing different brands and tech just to fine tune things , maybe trying out the latest coating or maybe just deciding that pure nickels have that vintage vibe you 're going for.But if you just need to know if Ernie Ball strings are any good they are . The bigger question for beginners is do I keep the gauge that came on my instrument , ( these for Gisbsons , Super Slinkys - pink package - for Fenders as a rule of thumb ) or do I try something new.In summary , for me these are the safe pick , the strings that I know will work when I just need a good set of strings at a great price . You really ca n't go wrong with a set of these .	1
Let me say this is a a great cable in every aspect.First , it works extremely well . No popping or clicking at all . Very flexible but solid feel to it . It looks better in person than in the pic too . And with the lifetime guarantee , you really ca n't go wrong here .	1
I already had one of these for the studio from another vendor and picked this one up as well . It was really old and dusty like its been laying around for years but that aside it works perfectly to put my camera right where I need it . Holds Zoom recorder as well with no issues when I am recording . This works perfectly to transform any mic stand into a more than worthy tripod .	1
The standard for mild , non-oily instrument cleaners . Leaves no residue , easy on old guitars ' finishes . I have used it for years .	1
After taking my guitar lessons ... I never knew there were soooo many kinds of flexibility or thickness of picks for guitars . My instructor told me that I need a variety to see which one or two felt good in my strumming hand , and to see if I could pick out some melody 's without too much problem . I realize the pick is not magical that it plays with out me doing the work , and I have been having fun trying all sorts of sizes , flexibilities , and strengths . Just go for the gusto and find what you like !	1
I own several tuners , and two Snark-2 tuners , which are great ( except they 're not low profile like theKorg Pitchclip Chromatic Clip On Guitar Tuner - Korg PC-1 -- please see my review of that tuner ) .So , since I needed another tuner for my ukulele , I ordered this time a Snark-6 . This one says , specifically , for a ukulele . I wanted to try it compared to the Snark-2Snark SN-2 All Instrument Clip-On Chromatic TunerThe Snark-6 and Snark-2 are identical , except for color . The Uke tuner here is gloss black , and the Snark-2 is matte red . Otherwise , the size of the dial/face , the clip itself is precisely the same . So , there 's nothing more ukulele relevant about the 6 versus the 2 . The tuning is chromatic , so it 's good for any specific instrument ( mandolin , guitar , uke , banjo , etc . ) .So , choose whichever color you prefer , and go for it . Sweet tuner . Superb graphics on the dial , colorful accurate , and inexpensive ( but not `` cheap '' build , like the Korg ) . Highly recommended tuner .	1
I purchased this to add basic effects to a small PA based on daisy-chainedPowerwerks PW50 Portable PA Systemheads and got a lot more than I bargained for.The effects are beautifully done . Reverb sounds natural and there is a wide range of choices for both reverb and echo . For the record I keep mine set at Club with the wet/dry knob set to a straight 12 o'clock position . Wet means more of the effect and dry means less.There is a mic gain on the left side of the unit , and the mic input ( XLR only ) has phantom power . The XLR out goes straight to your mixer . There is also a USB port for software I do not use so I can not speak to that feature.The unexpected bonus on this device is the tone feature , which I leave on . It adds a dimension to vocals that does not interfere with them , not does it alter them in ways that are mechanical sounding - you can set it for minor to major pitch correction . I suspect that most folks will want less of this than more.Overall this is a perfect addition to a vocalist 's toolbox because it is straightforward to use and relatively inexpensive . It 's also perfect for adding vocal effects to small , bare-bones PA systems . It transformed mine from essentially a loudspeaker to a true PA .	1
Iv'e tried a lot of thumb picks ( i use them for bass ) you no what that doe 's to them , these are the one 's i 'm staying with these thumb 's .	1
This stand is probably one of the most popular among smaller bands , jammers and home studio owners because I run across them everywhere . And like everyone else I wound up with a few of my own . Here is what I have learned during the four or so years I have owned and used this model : - For the money they are a bargain and work extremely well in home studios and practice spaces ( assuming the areas are not overly cramped . ) - They hold up under light gigging and jamming , meaning they are not transported more than two or three days a week.- Good stability inside , even with heavier microphones like theBlue Microphones enCORE 100 Studio-Grade Dynamic Performance Microphone . Not so good outside if there is a fair breeze.I lost one to stepping inadvertently on one of feet , which immediately broke , and another has started binding when I try to extend or collapse the center pole . Those problems are not necessarily quality issues since in the case of the broken tripod it was my fault and not the gear 's . As for the binding - I am sure that a good amount of grime has found its way into the tube after four years of use and transporting the stands . Had I taken better care of them those problems may have been prevented.For inexpensive stands these are hard to beat . However , I now use theSeismic Audio - Tripod Microphone Mic Boom Stand - PA/DJ/Band/Church/Wedding use , which I consider to be a superior stand for a small increase in price . Also , for outside use or when stage real estate is an issue I have found the old school styleOn Stage MC7201B Round Base Microphone Stand , Blackto be a far better solution .	1
For the price they are awesome strings ... . I like the sound ( I like a little heavier sound ) , and I 'm hoping the high E will hold up a little longer than the lower gauge & # 34 ; its always the first to go & # 34 ; . You cant beat the price on amazon I paid 9.50 at my music store but I needed strings ASAP , I will order back ups at this price .	1
great for carrying with you . works as it should . good price . I would recommend it if you need a table top mic stand or one just off the floor about a foot .	1
Bought this strap to provide extra comfort for my young son who has to hold up a relatively heavy electric guitar . Suggestions to make this better woudl be a slidable padding , and to have the padded area longer .	1
This is a nice , sturdy well made guitar stand . It is great for gigs as it is small and travels lightly .	1
For years I have used a different type of capo , this one is so much easier to use and does an excellent job !	1
Planet Waves makes good stuff . Take the load off your shoulder from that old Jazz bass , and get a padded 3 inch wide strap . It 's long enough to allow my bass to rest at arm 's length . I can adjust it to fit my acoustic guitar , which I hold much higher , and check out the little 'pick-pocket ' . I like these well enough that I have four of them .	1
Needed a stand to lift my PA mixer off the floor for safety and ease of use . For $ 20 , this is a sturdy little unit and collapses nicely for transportation . But it is a definite tipping risk if used at anything higher than the lowest height setting.I took the lead from reviewer W. Jones and `` removed the upper brackets and inserted them with the longest bars horizontal instead of vertical , and although my amp was more stable , I still did n't feel it was stable enough to set it on the highest setting . '' I am using at the lowest height and it is stable , but I highly recommend a heavy sandbag on the back if any other height setting is used.I give four stars for great value at $ 20 , will suit my needs very well .	1
This pedal has tone ! its very easy to use and program , I did not have idea on how to use it , and really quick I got it , it has a great interface , it sounds great , you just need some time to adapt and you will be creating your own tones in no time.The distrosion is great some people say they arent but I really love them , its a matter of taste and creating your tones , some preset may not be good for youThe downside it does not have the AC adapter but I knew this.The lights under certain light conditions are very bright , But this pedal is note heavy , well constructed and sturdy , I got the AC adapter so I dont have to be on the batteries all the time.This pedal has the whole package , effects , great tone , great distorsion and cleans .	1
No much to these things , but they are cheap and they work great in the studio . They shipped quickly and did n't break the bank .	1
Bought this for my guitar pedals and it works great and does n't cost much . I just attached it to an existing adapter and voila .	1
Easy install and great price . Shopped these for awhile and had to get all my guitars off the floor , bed , corners of room etc Installed in two minutes . Holds neck lightly - easy up easy down . Padded so does not scratch finish on neck . Will buy again .	1
While I have n't used a lot of capos in my playing , I have used 4 or 5 different types , and this is easily the best of that batch.While all capos require a certain amount of fiddling to get them to hold the strings down just right on each different guitar , this one was pretty easy to `` dial in . '' I had very little trouble getting a position which gave good clear tones from each string without having to mess with tuning.The action of the grip and release mechanism is easy , but it delivers firm pressure to the strings . In fact , the only negative I found was that the height of the capo made it a bit difficult to fret near it on the higher strings on some chords.Overall , this is a very good capo , and I can recommend it without hesitation .	1
i own two of these ... the first did not have a compartment door..so things just roll around inside case..not happy ... but this one is just fine.looks great ... no i would not take it on tour ... but as far as run around and taking lessons..its safe all latches match up well ... enjoy will order again	1
these work better than anything else I ever used to muffle drums and get out all those annoying overtones while recording , think this product came from outer space because man could not make a product so great that is so cheap that works so well .	1
Nice picks . A bit small for my preference . Great for picking , kind of harsh for strumming , Quality seems top-notch . Some guitarists will love these .	1
I got two of these for my electric bass and rhythm guitars . Great little stands at a great price . They are sturdy , easy to assemble and adjustable . I 'd suggest this to anyone needing a guitar stand .	1
I usually keep pick in my mouth when I do n't use them but sometimes I drop them , and at a show you do not have time to bend down and grab it , so this is a nice option to have a spare one , if you use bass picks , get this , it is bigger than the guitar version , much like the picks .	1
Large pedal board plenty of room for all pedals including octaswitch . The included velcro works well for me , I have n't had any pedals fall off yet ! Cioks PSU fits underneath with a couple of modifications . I 'm careful with my stuff so the soft case suits me fine , I can sling it over my shoulder and carry guitar/amp all at once . Plus it has a large useful pocket on the front of the bag . If you travel a lot the hard case will probably be better though .	1
Great tuner just bought 8 of them for X-Mas presents . Very easy to use clip on and go . The price was great . fits in your case . battery life is good . very versatel . Tune my Mandolin and Banjo with it.and they look really cool	1
I usually use 9s , but decided to try these 10s instead . I did n't notice much of a difference at first , but after a while I noticed that it 's easier to tune between the G and D string ( 3rd and 4th strings ) because the gauges are closer . Sound is just right for instrumental rock , shredding metal and delivering that Fatal Blow ...	1
I bought this for my son so he could record with it . He does stuff on the internet with other people musically and says it works good for him .	1
Excellent stomp box . You can dial it right in to get that SRV sound . Very sturdy and very well made . A must have for any blues player .	1
I bought this cord after returning a cheap one that I should 've known better than to buy . My son , who has some experience as a musician recommended the Hosa brand when I was seeking a proper replacement.I bought it for a small home recording setup which includes a Behringer C-1 Condenser Microphone and a Behringer Xenyx 302 Mixer , and both ends make a reliable connection to both the board and the mic ; the sound quality is excellent.An excellent value for the money .	1
I think a set of five is a bit overkill since i only needed three , but these are a direct replacement for the originals .	1
These are great cables . The only con I could give is if they go bad ... no opening up the ends to fix them , but in my experience they are durable . Most people are using these on a pedal board so there 's not a lot of movement to wear them down .	1
This stand works fine if you do n't need a shock mount . The base is wide and heavy enough to secure the mic well and defeat most vibrations . I ran into trouble when trying to mount a R0DE NT2-A mic on a shock mount . The low height ( 4 1/2 '' ) - which would otherwise help stabilize the mic - left too little clearance between the mic and desktop . If you think you might upgrade and someday use this stand with a shock mounted mic , you 're better off buying the slightly more expensiveOn Stage DS7200B Adjustable Desk Microphone Stand , Black.BTW , my copy of this stand also did not have the 3/8 inch male thread .	1
this pedal is simple ... i own 4 or 5 joyo overdrive pedals , .i love them all ... they all differ somewhat , , , ,i fell in love with this one the most , . , set volume and gain to maximum loudness that you desire , , , then back off your guitar volume and it cleans up wonderfully ... .and when you are ready to wail , just turn up your guitar volume. , , , ,and whammo , ... its a very non-colored sounding overdrive ... , ,its hard to call it any particualr sound ... its just really good and clear and powerful ... .	1
This bag fits my Epiphone Les Paul II electric guitar very well ... but no room to spare . The outside pocket is too small for sheet music , but works for small things like a tuner and short cable . I prefer a bigger pocket , but aside from that I ca n't complain . This gig bag looks really sharp , and has two shoulder straps for convenient carrying .	1
I was worried about dropping my guitar on my foot , or the floor . The strap would n't hold my guitar any longer . I wanted something cheap , something that do n't require to remove the buttons by unscrewing it , I was worried about damaging my guitar . So I decided to get this strap lock , it rocks and it works perfectly .	1
Had a guitar for years , , always tune it but never time to practice , it tells you what note is actually being played when your string is out of tune so you can zero in on the correct one better..	1
I bought these as back up stands and now use them all the time , they perform just as good as the better stands and I liked the 2 pack value ... Nice ...	1
If you are picky these are all eye candy ... nice flexible , easy to hold and I received on time at a great price .	1
As stated it 's a bit heavy which causes problems when used on a stand with a boom , but it 's a decent product at a fair price .	1
I purchased these cables for my Behringer 802 mixer & MXL 770 mic and these cables are perfect ! Finally get to have quality sounding tracks knowing I have the professional cables to back me up ! The best XLR cables you can find . Hands down .	1
I ca n't find a single complain about this amp . The amp modelling is fantastic . Plug in for a mic/CD/M3 player . Quality driver . I 'm not going to go through all the features that yo ucan read o nthe website . I used to play through a chameleon and separate amp in a rack to get these effects . Only thing I wish it had was the ability to save a custom sounds . But you ca n't ask for much more for the price of $ 399 . You wo n't be disappointed with this amp .	1
This is a rock solid throne that has a wide adjustment range for height and a workable range for the backrest.The height of the backrest is fixed , but you can adjust how far back it can be moved . I am referring to lateral motion and not a tilt angle . The seat itself has a nice , comfortable padding that is about on par with a mid range drum throne ( I apologize , but that is my best reference for comparison . ) Assembling is simple and fast . I had some issues lining up the seat height that stemmed from the need to perfectly align two outer and two inner holes in the frame and seat bar , but after getting a feel for the tight tolerances I managed to get it done with no problems.Another thing to note is this is primarily for guitarists . The foot rests are not going to be much used by drummers in particular , nor by keyboardists whose feet will probably be busy with sustain and expression pedals . However . this is still ideal for keyboardists because the seat is comfortable and the backrest promotes good posture.I used this with drums . but be aware that the seat will not swivel , so the front bar across the bottom can interfere with pedals and your snare drum stand - unless you move it back a bit.The final note is this is heavy and somewhat clunky to transport . It 's not a deal breaker . On the contrary , it will reduce performance fatigue because of the ergonomic design and that alone offsets any inconvenience .	1
This was exactly what I needed for the price range I could afford in a crunch . My old mic just was n't cutting it going into my computers USB audio interface.There are nice changes in sound texture from different angles . It is really sensitive to pop and breath so a pop filter is critical for vocals . It is recording my guitar beautifully.I 've even been able to record nice quick tracks for copyright recordings of both my voice and guitar . I 've set the stand low and angled the mic towards the guitars sound hole ( slightly back ) and sing into the top at about 45 degrees and back a little . I found a quick comfortable balance and the result is warm and clean.I 'm very happy with this unit ( price considered but I 'd have to pay a LOT more to improved on it ) . I 'll probably get another one . I kind of wish I 'd have bought that combo kit .	1
Enjoyable mic , has a decent frequency response range , nice patterning to not pick up too much ambient room noise . I usually have to do some post-processing on vocals , but in the genres I work in that 's not exactly a rare thing . Either way sounds way better than I would expect for a mic at this price . Have n't tried it for drums or guitar *yet* but I 'm impressed with it 's ability to accurately capture vocals . While it does n't have the warmth that some mics relay , I prefer it that way . It leaves a really clean , if slightly cold/flat feeling , that can then be warmed up in post production nicely.Good value for the sound , no complaints with the shock mount . Though make sure to be cautious with your mic placement , get a pop filter , and if you have a room with lots of ambient noise do n't be shocked if it picks some of it up . All in all a good deal .	1
wow wow I ca n't believe it working wonderful.I 'm using it karaoke online in paltalk.I did compairation with somes I have , it 's perfect vocal.I connected it with mixer Alesis 8 input.I wish it 's built with switch on/offRecomend to buyer . Thanks Amazon	1
These tuners ( including the red version ) are the best . I have many tuners , from expensive Peterson and Boss , Korg , Seiko , Quiktune , and many other brands , from standard tuners to a few different brands of clip ons . The Snark is the easiest and most stable to use . Even my young guitar students , who have had trouble learning to tune using other tuners that I love , have no problem tuning with this tuner .	1
This product does exactly what it is supposed to do at a decent price . I have absolutely no complaints . This is my first experience with the brand and I am not disappointed .	1
Bought this switch as the OEM for my son 's Bronco 40 which gives you an off/preset 1/preset 2 switching set up . Simple , light and does what its suppose to . Not built like a tank , but better than the cheap after market versions . Gives you lots of cable so that it is good and practical for real life gig set ups . Cable and plug are solid , thick Fender quality components . Worth the money .	1
this is my first petal of any kind . I had read that the Wah shoud be your first so I went with that . glad I did . this Wah petal is so much fun . you can make as many cool sounds as your imagination will allow . It is hours and hours of fun . the sounds are great . I have had no problem with performance . it works as it should . I highly recommend this petal . it 's price is attractive as well .	1
But unless you are new to guitar , you know that . These strings are more expensive because they are supposed to last longer . Really , I ca n't tell that they do . Or that they do n't . They sound great , and play great and I usually purchase D'Addario or Martin strings . Not sure if I would pay more for these in future , I play an average of daily to every other day depending on what gets in the way . Change the strings every couple of months . Just me at home so no big deal , if I were performing I would go through them faster.I 'm giving 5 stars because D'addario makes great strings . 'Nuff said .	1
THIS is truly the bestest bangest for your buckest ! I 've tried dozens of od pedals in the past , ( I hate this term ) boutiques and non boutiques before I finally stick with SS/BS Mini OD as my always-on pedal cos that thing is a supersonic bad ass since it could cover my needs on clean boost , edge-of-breakup `` clean '' sound , distortion , or even a messed up broken speaker fuzz tonez.. only with your guitar volume knob ! ( please note that you 'll need to have a treble bleed circuit to do this ) Okay back to this EHX , I 'm kinda tired of messing around with guitar volume knob on the mini so I bought this Hot Tubes as my `` clean '' breakup sound so that I could hit it hard with a cranked up Mini OD . And this , my friend.. JESUS APPROVED ! The point is , this pedal 's so great and has a great range of dirt.. also works awesome with your guitar vol knob as well for the gain range . It 's literally like an overdrive coming from a tube amps . I can be really fussy about od pedals but this one is a keeper ! PS : Look at the price.. do you really have to overthink on getting this pedal ? Just get it , try it , and see if you like it , jeez ! : - )	1
I always lose my damn picks , this helps . Hopefully I do n't lose this pick holder that would really suck because there is like ten in there !	1
nothing fancy , its plastic but the quality is by no means bad . it serves its purpose and is simple which i can not complain about	1
This is a great effect . I am very happy with it . Awesome engineering as Jim Dunlop 's MXR products has always presented . The true bypass feature and the high-end quality materials make it very reliable and dependable . This delay device is ( on my humble opinion ) probably the best delay out there . It is very sensitive and delivers as it should , with a delay rate from 0 to 600 miliseconds . Most units offer a max of around the 400 mark and are normally quite large in size and take a lot of space on the pedal boards . This pedal is just another little pedal on your board that will deliver . I am actually sure this will exceed all your expectations . Ships fast . Highly recommended .	1
A good quality cable to use while playing sitting , to go down to my processor on the floor in front of me . The angle goes up tight to the floor unit and out of the way and 5 feet is plenty . Great cable ! I use Fender 's 15 foot angle plug from the processor to my amp because stepping on the plugs can break the jacks .	1
The cobalt seems like it gives the strings a silkier feeling . Maybe it 's just me , but that 's how they come across . I noticed that these strings become discolored quicker than the stock steel , but do n't lose that new sound new as fast . I did n't have near as much string stretch with these either . I 'll keep using them , just maybe in a different gauge .	1
I am a long-time musician who has been through a lot of capos ; some that I hope to never see again : ) ... fortunately , things have changed for the better ... What serious guitar players have always needed is a capo that is smart and small , durable , quick change , one hand operation that also has the right tension to make sure there is no string buzz or detuning ... for a while , you could get quick change or tension adjusment , but not both in the same capo ... the last several years have seen manufacturers attempting to provide these key features in one acceptable capo ... now there are many choices out there at various price points and frankly , it gets confusing ... So why this particular capo ? First Planets Waves is a name I have come to trust to provide quality accessories at reasonable prices ... this NS Tri-Action Capo is built sturdy but it is very light and unobtrusive on the guitar neck ... one-hand changing is a cinch and it has a well place adjustable spring tensioner ... so far , this capo covers all the bases in a simple design as well or better than anything else I 've tried for the price ... One thing I did not expect is that , because of the design and tensioning , I can use it on Tenor Guitar , Banjo and Mandolin as well ... while I prefer a smaller capo for these other instruments , in a pinch , I can just clip on the NS Tri-Action and keep playing ... I am the kind of guy that when I find something in the instrument world that works , I stick with it for years ... it is possible that this capo may become my favorite ... I just really like the look , feel and features of this smart design ... looks like Planet Waves hit the mark once more ...	1
Great for the beginner !	1
Was a great problem solver for me but almost exactly one year after getting it the volume died . Useless now . I used the `` line '' input ( to tap into an aux feed that got recorded ) as it came off a live board . For the price I guess I should n't complain too much . Behringer often means trading price for longevity as the QC seems to be very hit and miss . So now time to decide ; do I resign myself to replace it every year or get something mo betta ? Note : this is a low end , but still `` pro audio , '' piece of a equipment . And while it truley does n't get super loud , for people who say it barely does anything volume wise I have to wonder if they are using it with home audio equipment ? If so , your signal strength going into the unit is likely well below the +4dBu `` line level '' signal that pro gear offers . Subsequently you are boosting a signal that is much lower to begin with . And as a result are getting poor volume plus the added `` bonus '' of increased distorion and/or floor noise when you do try and crank it up.Update : well it works some days and not others it seems- so a I keep it around for now as I am having more good days than bad days with it lately . Ca n't really see a rhyme of reason to it- connections do n't seem loose or intermitant or anything like that- I just either have good volume or it craps out ? ? ? It is in one permanent location , used exacty the same way every time- so it 's never a matter of a different configuration or using it with different gear .	1
For a ten spot , ya ca n't do better . Matte flat black finish is nice.Great durable foam contact points for cradling baby.Double dog dare ya to do better.You just can not . Excellent deal ! !	1
I have replaced my old tarnished screws with these . They fit great and plenty of screws . I am going to replace all my old screws with these .	1
Everything you need to keep your guitar clean and Polished and sexy ! no matter if you are a horrible player like me you will get all the chicks because your guitar looks sexy ! the girls will love you and the boys too !	1
I bought this to work with my 9 year old son . This will do many cool things , although I am not ready to turn him loose with it yet . I have had difficulty finding the autherision code for the included software . I have been using Audacity which is a free download . I would pay the price again in a hartbeat .	1
This is a simple footswitch that allows you to switch between two different presets on your Fender Mustang amp . It is very easy to use , and works exactly as advertised . This switch is not bulletproof , but works great for playing around with your small practice amp .	1
The One Spot is a great way to supply power to all your stomp boxes without a bulky power supply or a bunch of wall warts . Get it , you wo n't be sorry .	1
This mic stand does everything it says it will , and is adjustable in every conceivable way . In fact , the boom has a really nice adjusting lever , making it easy to loosen and tighten . The only drawback I found is the tripod configuration of its feet , making it easy to forget where you parked your big feet during live performances ; especially when you 're emotionally invested and the crowd is urging you on . I would much prefer a round base . Other than that , it makes for a great home/garage mic stand when you or your band is just kickin ' it . 'Nuff said .	1
Okay , so ... it 's small , easy to dial in a good sound , very inexpensive , made here in the US , and has a wonderful transparency to it.Add to that the different ways to configure it ( by using the internal dip switches ) , and you have a compressor as flexible as any I 've used for guitar at half or less of many cost ( which sound , imho , no better ) .It stacks well with the EP booster and another comp/boost in the chain , too.Whether you want to drive your amp a little harder or just squash your signal , this product is impossible to beat.I totally adore it .	1
These were purchased for my parts bin . They fit , they work , they are quiet and they wo n't make your life miserable . That 's all I want from replacment parts .	1
beautiful tone and durable string , nice tension , very good for bends , sweep picking and rakes . Did I mentioned great value ?	1
I 'm a professional musician and love these cables , they look great and perform great and feel a lot tougher than the rubber covered cables I 've been using	1
I really like these strings . Good sound and the feel is good . Not sure there is much difference in tension of lighter strings , however . I only bought one set , not three sets and have not had to change them yet after three months .	1
I bought five of these when they were being blown out for like $ 3 apiece , but even at the normal price they are a bargain . They are comfortable when used for an extended period of time- even with a heavy Les Paul . If you play an SG , these will help counter the dreaded 'neck dive ' that you get when using a nylon strap with those guitars . Incidentally , Amazon is selling these straps at about 1/3 the price you would pay at GC . Highly recommended !	1
I probably should buy another one for other guitars , but I carry in my electric case . I 'm sure the day I will need it , I will have acoustic with me ! I use different method for my bass , but this is perfect for 6 strings !	1
Inexpensive . Light weight yet sturdy while holding a guitar . Folds up and can easily be stored . Highly recommend this for the guitar player .	1
I was pleasantly surprised of how heavy the base was compared to what I was expecting . The adjustable stand also works great and wo n't fall on you or anything . I bought this and a mic/boom stand for my Samson SP01 Shockmount ( which the Audio-Technica condenser mic is on ) , however its connecting slot is a 3/8in female while this stand has a 5/8in male ( same with the mic/boom stand ) . So just make sure whatever it is you 're buying can connect properly with the stand . If not , just buy a cheap ( about 6 $ ) adapter like I did .	1
Great strings ! Used them for years -- always loved them . Put them on an Eric Johnson strat . Would n't use anything low quality for that guitar .	1
For the price these ca n't be beat . At this price it does n't hurt to have a spare one or two on hand for the inevitable emergency	1
My daughter has been using these strings for many years now and they work great . Excellent price and product is as described and price was right .	1
I 'm pretty impressed with it . I 've only used plug-in types of tuners prior , and this was a nice surprise . I ran this through my ukulele , electric guitars as well as an electric bass . I was blown away how it could tune my bass . It works quickly , and it seems pretty accurate compared to my Petersen . I would recommend it to anyone . Took one star off for visibility . Certain lighting and certain angles can wash out the display very easily .	1
Having recently purchased an Epiphone EL-00 I went about changint the bridge pins and bridge itself from the installed plastic units to Graph Tech 's Tusq material . It is hard to emphasize just how much they have improved the tone of what was a very good instrument to begine with . The top resonates with a greater sustain due to the vibrational transfer of the Tusq bridge and pins , the note to note defination went from very good to exceptional . This was one of the best modifications I have made to an instrument in many years of tweaking my instruments . I have a nut on the way to complete the upgrade ... I can barely wait . I highly recommend this product it will give your instrument a new voice .	1
sing that in a drivin and cryin 90s alt rock way . why ? cause that 's what this bad boy ( or girl to be pc ) does . It is instant ideas . The thing that makes this so simple and effective is you can simply record a riff ( or melody/top part ) , then create around it , loop by loop , or just one idea with another on top . As simple as this sounds , otherwise , you would have to record a track , then play over that , taking time and killing inspiration in the process.There are others on the market , to be sure . I had the boss looper with 2 pedals , and it was noisy on playback . That was years ago , and I could n't get rid of it fast enough ! I 've used delay pedals my whole life , and being a fan of shoegaze/dream pop , I have always had a love of layered guitars/loops , a la the church or the chameleons , or chapterhouse , lush , house of love , and stuff.I looked on youtube and read reviews for a while before my purchase , as I do n't have money to waste . This seemed to be the best choice for me . The use of this live , especially without the footswitch ( sold seperately ) , would be tough to be sure . There are some stop and start moments , as to be the case with loopers . The only one I 've seen that seems seamless is the boss one or roland one with like 5 pedals and is like 700 bucks maybe more . There are demos of a guy looping himself with different instruments all running into it . For the price , it should be and is great.This little wonder though , is fantastic . The price ca n't be beat , and it does n't suck up tone as some of the other ones do from what I 've read . The thing I would say is , it 's best for recording , and to use as an audio notepad in a way . You can use saved loops in songs , but since they are already formed , so it 's silly to start a song with 5 guitars in a dense dance ! my last thought on this , this is a secret , come closer ... ... closer now ... come on I wo n't bite ... ... ... .A VOLUME PEDAL ! that way you can layer with different adjusted levels and not bending down and fixing levels and such . sounds simple , but you 'll see . I am going to look for a decent one .	1
You have just simply got to try this little guitar stand . It folds up so small , and yet remains very stable in use . Adjustable in a snap , but if you even forget that , it will grip your instrument better than a metal stand . Anything can be knocked over , but this really works better than you might believe . Goood !	1
I purchased this PA after reading several reviews and was convinced that is was right for me . I like that it is small and can fit right into my backpack . I was using the ION system it just got to be to much to carry around . I go around to different venues and sing . I just started in April after taking vocals for a year . I love it so much I 've purchased this and my own Shure mic . B205D is a powerful speaker system . I love the crisp sound and now I can hear myself sing when I turn up the music . I needed something with EQ on it as well . you really ca n't go wrong with this PA/monitor . I would have rated a 5 except when I turn it up around 45 degrees it begins to hiss . I 'm not sure if this is normal or not . you see I purchased an open box speaker . The outer box packaging was questionable but once opened the PA itself was in prime condition no visible damage and all the materials were packed well . The sound is great . I 'm testing it out at home for now still have some time if I 'm not comfortable with the hissing . Hope this helps with your decision .	1
I bought this on a whim to use as a low cost tuner for my Hola ! uke ... and find myself using it on my six string guitar and four string bass as well . It tunes quickly and easily , with different colors used for when your too high or too low in pitch , and uses green as the color when you nail it , very nice and easy to use . It 's also very compact , easily storing in even the tightest of gig bags , even your pants pocket will do for traveling.I highly recommend this if your on a tight budget and can only get one tuner for multiple instruments , it 's a bargain and it works great . You ca n't honestly ask for more !	1
This is definitely a sturdy and well made stand - I have no fault with it about that . Solid materials , everything snaps and latches tightly . Good materials . Works just like it 's supposed to.I have two complaints about it , though.1 . The part that holds the music is n't as wide as other stands . I probably could have read the description and realized that , but I made the assumption that all stands are the same size . It 's just wide enough to hold two regular sized pieces of paper . It will hold bigger things , of course , but the edges will go past the edge of the stand . So it works , but to me , it looks unprofessional to have the stuff leaking over the edges . The ledge is nice and wide , though , so it can hold some pretty thick stuff . But if you are using quite wide materials , especially if they are loose-leaf , you will want to look for a wider stand.2 . Adjusting the height and tilt is difficult . To alter the height , one has to twist and untwist the tightening ring ( like one finds on microphone stands ) . It does n't just pull up or push down like the majority of music stands I 've encountered in life . Adjusting the tilt requires untightening and tightening a wing nut on the back , which is a bit difficult to reach . Unlike every other music stand I 've used that one can simply force into position . The good news of this is , though , that because everything is held in place with wingnuts or that tightening ring , everything stays right where one puts it . No slow sliding down in height , no slow tilting backwards.On the plus side , they are sturdy , and the feet can be retracted ( is that the word ? ) so that they are parallel to the stand , making moving them around or stacking them up quite easy . I love the fact that the feet do this.These are excellent music stands .	1
Hello , I bought a Epiphone Goth Studio guitar and I also bought this beauty . I 'm very satisfied with the quality of this case , as it makes my guitar looks very nice and very nice protected .	1
Since , as of right now , this is the only review of this product on amazon.com , I 'll try to answer any questions you might have about the EHX Pocket Metal Muff Pedal . This pedal is the model of simplicity ; a volume control , a distortion control , and a switch that changes the amount ( or lack thereof ) of mid-scoop . That 's does n't leave much room for tone tweaking , so `` tweakers '' beware ! That being said , Electro-Harmonix did a commendable job of pre-setting useable treble and bass tone levels that should only require minor tweaking of your amp 's eq to get it right where you want it . Playing through my Fender hotrod deville amp , I was immediately shocked at how good this pedal sounded . The bass was powerful and chunky , great for heavy metal palm-muting riffs ; the treble had a good bite but it was n't harsh ; and all three midrange modes sounded great , depending on the application : Want just a flat midrange for a punchy tone ? Just leave the mid-switch on the flat setting . Want a slightly scooped midrange tone for a good all-round metal tone ? Move the switch down to the low mid-scoop mode . Do you want to play Master of Puppets by Metallica ? The high mid-scoop mode is calling your name . This pedal offers quite a bit of distortion , but I was amazed to find that even at the higher distortion levels , my tone remained clear and defined . It did n't turn into a plastic-y , fuzzy mess like most distortion pedals *cough* metal zone *cough* will . I will mention that this pedal is n't the best if you 're looking for a more modern metal tone . You wo n't get a slightly fizzy , ultra-gain ( think Slipknot ) sound out of this pedal . Rather it offers a very crunchy , defined roar more characteristic of the pre-dual rectifier mesa boogie amplifiers.In conclusion , I give this pedal 5 stars because it does what its designed to do very well ; this version of the metal muff line is n't designed to be highly versatile and `` tweakable '' in and of itself ; get the metal muff with top boost pedal if you want a 3-band eq and a boost function . This pedal is designed to be a very simple , small box of pure classic metal tone , and that 's exactly what it accomplishes .	1
I recently ordered 5 different ukulele models while researching products for my senior adult choir at church as I wanted to give them a few options.Okina UK100 Soprano Ukulele with Rosewood Fingerboard - NaturalDiamond Head DU-150 Ukulele , NaturalMahalo U-30OR Painted Economy Soprano Ukulele ( Orange ) Lanikai LU-11 Soprano UkuleleKala KA-15S Mahogany Soprano UkuleleThe Okina , Diamond Head and Mahalo were all under $ 30 at the time and within $ 2 price of each other . Of the three , I thought that the Mahalo was the best offering both visually and in terms of tone quality . The Okina had a poor sound quality even compared to my own 20- and 40-year-old ukuleles ( which had the original strings ) . A string upgrade to Aquila strings helped significantly , but even then , the Okina still had a far worse sound quality at this price level.The Diamond Head and Mahalo both sounded better even with the stock strings , and each includes a nice ( for this price ) little gig bag . The Mahalo has the most `` island '' look to my eyes and the best sound . Much of the sound can probably be attributed to the strings which are more substantial than the Diamond Head 's . That being said , it still makes financial and practical sense to get the Mahalo since it 's so near the same price ( compared to the Diamond Head ) and has heavier strings already installed . I 've also reviewed the Lanikai and Kala on their own pages.On an almost irrelevant note , the Diamond Head was the only instrument of the 5 to arrive in something close to actual tuned-up string tension . It takes several days for these nylon strings to stretch and settle in , but I did n't have to retune the Diamond Head so much because it was already virtually in tune . This would not be my primary concern with purchasing an instrument for myself but may be a significant headache-saver for a non-musician parent purchasing a ukulele for a young child .	1
I 've been using these strings on all my guitars , electric and acoustic , since the mid-70s . I 've tried many others , but always come back to Ernie Balls . They tune better and they keep the `` new strings '' sound longer and that 's the main plus , but they just `` feel '' good . I play and practice a lot and I abuse strings ... these can take it and come back for more !	1
These come with a stereo holding bar and adapter for mic stand . They do need 48 V phanom power from your board or a mic amp . I 'm using a mic amp and these are the input to a paging system which I will review in more detail later . The 48VDC comes from the mic processor then cancels feedback and sends the paging audio to my amplifier which I will review as a set.If you do stereo recording , you ca n't go wrong with these - their self noise level is so low it is below that of a human ear . It sounds great , and setup outside with 140 dB of gain it really performs well hearing birds chirp from far away , rain drops comming down , and sounds you never would hear.Note : NEVER get these wet - you must have a cover over them for outdoor use in the rain.You will need 2 XLR cables for full stereo recording with the transfer bar , but you already know that .	1
Sound quality is great . I also have the very first JamMan with the add on 3 button footswitch . I wanted a smaller footprint so I purchased this . Do n't expect to run out and use it at a gig without practice though . In a band setting , your time has to be spot on when you are hitting to record , stop and playback . Slightly more difficult than the BIG JamMan Looper but very usable . This blows away the Ditto pedal by another manufacturer ... ... I had that one first and it is horrible to use ... .sold it.I am happy with it and use it live in a 3 and 4 piece band situation to cover rhythm parts when I am soloing and for harmonized double lead passages . Excellent quality . It has a lot of great syncing features but I do not use those . Find a youtube video to see all of its potential . Best looper for the money .	1
So , I ordered this to learn to play the banjo , because of the price and good reviews . It was delivered yesterday , and the first thing I noticed was that the neck was loose , and the strings were easily an inch or more off the fret board . I looked to make sure it was n't warped or cracked , and it wasn't.So I scoured the internet to find my problem , and most results said to tighten the metal rod in the banjo pot . So I took the resonator off , and found that it had an inch gap between the neck and the body , and naturally that scared me , but I tightened the metal rod , and it brought the neck down to the body , and brought the strings down to the perfect height.Now it 's a very beautiful instrument , and it sounds pretty good too , Granted , It 's not a Gold Tone or what have you , But it sounds at-least like a banjo that costs 2-3x this much . The only thing I would change is the tuning pegs , as they are made out of a cheap plastic , they do n't feel like they will break any time soon though , I just prefer metal tuning pegs . ( the part that holds the strings is still metal , I 'm talking about the things your turn with your fingers to tune it is plastic ) So , I 'm debating on rating it 4 stars or 5 stars.. I 'd rate it 4 because of the scare it gave me at first , but I think I 'll rate it 5 stars because of it 's looks , sound , and price . Yes , the reviews are right guys , do n't be skeptical , But be warned that you may have to do a little TLC on it , as I did with the neck . No worries though , Now I 'm learning my new favorite instrument . ( Also , the strings that came on it are pretty decent , but new strings sound a bit better )	1
This is a Very nice cable , I like this one better than all the other ones that I Own , Its thick and the sound is great . Then one day an Amp was bumped over in such a way that the cable end was broken or sheared off , That stunk	1
These lighter strings are still the best thing for guitar tone since they ran a wire to them . My other review was for the heavier gauge Cobalts but these sound just as good , regardless of P90 , strat single coil or humbucker . Great tone , sustain and flexibility . I am sold on any Cobalt gauge - head and shoulders better than any other string on the market and I have tried them all .	1
No moving parts . No high tech components . The ultimate in low tech . It 's a rubber stamp and it works for the intended purpose . I find this size useful but I guess it depends on the individual 's needs . Enough said .	1
I bought two sets , this is a great why if to keep your strap on your guitar , if you still what to keep everything stock !	1
It is just as described , I am happy ! Amazon always comes through , without a hitch , it was delivered as usual before stated time !	1
Works very well and is portable . Guitar leans pretty far back , but I 'put a sock on it ' , no literally , and now the guitar leans at the right angle . Not literally a right angle , but a very good angle . Why do you have to be so difficult ?	1
It 's the same as the other flavors , which all work fine , but it looks great with my new white Gretch .	1
This stand is very stable and easy to put together . Works perfect for keeping my guitar safe from being knocked over .	1
This is my second case from them . Build good for carry and balance . Brass color lock that comes with it .	1
I hope there had been a closer picture of the product.I was a little surprised when I got it because it does n't look as great as I imagined.The white lightning is stamped on the black strap , the same goes for the GIBSON name on the end of it.Maybe it will get better looking in the long run .	1
I am not one to spend a lot on batteries so this was a no brainer . It has worked great now for over a year at least . I had to look it up and I have had this for 3 years tomorrow .	1
GLS continues to supply top quality cables at a reasonable price . I have been happy with all my purchases from GLS to date and will continue to use them whenever the need arises .	1
I did a lot of research and I finally found the right capo.. It is a little bit pricey , but you get what you pay for ... It is made from a very good material and I have been using this for years ! ! ..There are some others capo that are less expensive , but most of them are built with plastic and some will hurt your guitar.. This capo is made with stainless steel and you can adjust the tension.. I like this and I highly recommend this capo to any guitar players regardless of their level . Good Luck .	1
I have a small format 10 channel mixer for my acoustic and small gigs and it has no built in effects . It also gets a little bit noisy when using the EQ on the two mic pre channels.The Mic Mechanic allows me to dial in foot switchable effects right on y pedalboard , where they should be for a solo act or when your running your own sound . I typically leave the & # 34 ; Tone & # 34 ; button on at all times , as it gives a nice eq curve and mild compression . Effects are easy dial up on the selector and can be customized by using the modifiers ... ( read the manual ) . The correction works pretty well for me , but someone who is a bett vocalist may not need it , in which case , you can turn it down . I typically run mine around 12-1:00E thing I do n't like about this pedal is its 12v power consumption . It can be phantom powered , but if I engage phantom power on my mixer it is on for both mic pres And I use the other often times for a second dynamic mic when playing as a duo . It can run off the Sanyo Pedal Power without issue however and I often use it on my acoustic pedalboard with a compressor and delay/reverb for my guitar .	1
I 'd give this baby six stars if I could . My prior practice amp ( a Vox ) was very nice , but finally went south and required replacement . I was looking for something with a great tube sound , as most of the solid-state amps that I 've used ( mainly fenders and line6 stuff ) just do n't get there . I was actually looking at the Fender Blues Junior and headed to my local GC to check 'em out and listen side-by-side . The first time I plugged a Strat into this guy in the store , I was blown away ( and that was with all of the Jimmy Page wannabes cranking different amps all over the store ) . I 've got ta say , part of me was hoping to rationalize the extra buck for a Blues Junior , but the Bugera actually sounded better . The only one left in the store was the floor model , so I grabbed it.Got it home and cranked it up and here are my observations : - It 's solid and heavy . It 's still a small-fry ( slightly bigger than most 15w amps out there ) , but much heavier.- The construction is great . I think I read some reviews that knocked the construction , but from the handle to the floor everything looks like it 's built to last.- The sound is even better at home ( without the GC cacophony ) - Adjustments are minimal , but enough . The tone adjustment basically takes the tone from fat to sharp . I 've run my Strat , Tele and Taylor T5 through this . I think the hard bodies get the best blues tone , but I can get a really nice clean tone from my T5- The headphones sound great . I was really surprised by this . I would have thought you needed the speaker to get that great fat tube tone , but sounds awesome through a pair of good headphones- The price is self-explanatory , but that 's really the part that blew me away . This amp would sell for double the price tag .	1
I use this soft flexible cable between my 48 volt phantom PS , and the mic connector to my system because it need not be long to do its job . No audible hum detected when using this mic cord , either . Feels solid , and will probably last for many years to come .	1
If you want U2 kind of sounds then this is a good entry into this type of sound . Thing i dont like is a poping sound when you tunr the time knob . For the price and home use its a good pedal for someone on a budget .	1
There are n't enough uke straps out there for a good price . This one is great . I take away one star because the padded part could be a bit smaller , lighter .	1
Behringer does n't have the best of reputations , but some of their gear does a great job at the price . This is one of them . This gives me plenty of clean volume to run my headphones . I run a project studio with an Apogee Duet as my interface . I needed this because sometimes I need to monitor something while another person in the room is recording/monitoring a track.My main headphones are Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro , Sennheiser HD 555 , Sony MDR-V6 , and then I have some others . All of my headphones are comfortably driven by this headphone amp with plenty of gain on tap and I get very good volume , and even at the exact same volume as the input , I find that the sound is improved by using this headphone amp . It 's hard to describe , but it just feels a bit fortified and a little bit stronger . I 've had a Presonus headphone amp before that cost many times as much as this little Behringer headphone amp and the sound was no better.The volume pots are very smooth and there is no noise that I can hear that is introduced by this amp . Make sure you use a quality sound source because this will faithfully amplify anything that goes in . For instance , if I run a cable from my iMac 's built-in headphone output to this amp and turn up the volume , I can hear a little buzz and random digital sounds , but that 's not the amp , it 's the source . Running the output from my Apogee Duet , the sound is very clean and strong.There are some annoying things about this amp . Obviously the external power supply is annoying , there 's no on-off switch , and it 's light enough that when everything is plugged in , it does n't want to stay in place . However , that 's nothing that Velcro tape on the desk ca n't fix , and the rest of the problems are stuff you have to live with when you get something that does so much for less than the price of a decent pair of headphones .	1
I bought this amp to replace a Squier SP-10 that came with my guitar . The Squier had no effects , just a clean channel and an overdrive button . I could n't afford a bunch of pedals , but I wanted some effects so I could get cool sounds from my electric guitar . I saw the reviews for this little amp on Amazon and decided to give it a try . It is Awesome ! For such a small amp , the output is plenty loud for practicing at home , and it runs on batteries , too , so I can take it anywhere . The effects are better than I 'd hoped for . This is certainly not for the pro who performs onstage or with a drummer , but for an intermediate level guitarist ( like me ) who just plays for his own pleasure or to please his family , this is the amp to get . It has several modeling functions and you can choose between chorus , flanger , phaser , or tremelo while still adding either reverb or delay . I 'm one of the growing number of retirees who decided to pick up the guitar and learn more about it now that I have the time . I do n't need the deafening stacks that the kids like . I love this amp .	1
Picks are personal thing and even then everyone seems to change once in a while . I really like the feel of this hard little pick with the round edge , which gives a warm round sound , but if you like to have the bluegrass banjo sound , all you need to do is file down one edge to what you 'd like and you can have it all . Great pick , I recommend it .	1
very comfortable , lightweight , strong . Good stitching , leather ends and adjustable for short or tall . Affordable and comes in many colors .	1
I think these are great for the price they give you . John Mayer uses these picks and hes one of my favorite guitarist so I am sticking with these .	1
Bought for home use , bought the musicians gear 13 '' gooseneck to go along with it for playing guitar while singing . great mic stand for the price .	1
The Pignose is not the world 's best travel amp , or portable amp , or practice amp . It 's not very good for vocals , it 's inefficient , what with its 40-year old design , and it distorts way too easy . There are far better amps for most purposes from Boss and others that deliver a lot more clean volume , thanks to modern class-D amp technology , and a variety of digital effects to boot.BUT ... there is one area where the Pig prevails . If you 're looking for the sound of a big overdriven amp in the studio , or miked on stage , the Pignose will give you that sound for less than the cost of one good quality overdrive pedal . By opening and closing the box , you can get a range of cabinet sounds from the open-back Fender to the classic Marchall sealed cab , and everything in between . Frank Zappa recorded a lot of his guitar parts using nothing but his SG running into a Pignose , and he got fantastic sounds.Beyond that , it 's cool looking , reasonably rugged , and even has pegs that allow you to hang it from a guitar strap . Every rocker needs one .	1
Dang that 's metal . Were the first words I said when plugging this thing in to the line . With a wide range of sound and versatility with just one pedal and two buttons is awesome . The only issue was with some manufacturing detail . The input and out put jacks are screwed up and nearly broke my cables when trying to set it up for the first time . The buttons were way to stiff and made a horrid crunch the first time I used it and after talking to amazon it turns out that just seems to be how it is . Be sides that its metal , nothing more nothing less . Razor sharp high ends or some butt draggin muddy slop of sound either way your covered with this pedal .	1
Although this mic is now considered primarily an instrument mic , that was not always the case and I 've actually preferred this same basic design for live vocal use since 1970 when I bought my first one which was then known as a `` Shure Model 545 Unidyne III . '' That mic got stolen about 2 years ago , but remarkably was still working at the time it got boosted and I was still using it when I needed one with an on/off switch function . I 've owned or used countless modern day SM-58 's and SM-57 's along with dozens of other mics over the years from all manufacturers . I have a fairly deep baritone to bass type voice and I do n't need to get closer than about 7 or 8 inches to a SM-57 . To me the SM-57 sounds similar to the $ 469 Shure SM-7 studio vocal mic if you put a windscreen on it and get about 2 inches away . I 'd only use an SM-7 in a studio environment though because they are slightly more fragile and over four times as expensive . By design the SM-58 's require you to get much closer to the mic to get a full range sound than with the SM-57 's . I prefer the SM-57 's over the SM-58 's for vocal use because they sound crisper on the highs and they sound fuller on the low end . The SM-57 sounds more natural on vocals and never sounds muddy or muffled . The SM-57 has one of the most pronounced proximity effects of any mic I 've ever used . If you tend to shove the mic down your throat you may benefit from the less dramatic proximity effect of the SM-58 . If you are ever going to use an SM-57 for vocals I 'd recommend buying the Shure A2WS windscreen with it . That genuine Shure windscreen fits precisely and locks securely onto the SM-57 . The SM-57 will pop like mad without one . The only possible drawback to the SM57 as a vocal mic is that there is no model available with an on/off switch these days . I ca n't find a modern SM-57 with a switch anywhere . However , if you 've ever tried using a mic when you forgot that the switch was in the off position it probably just became a liability . For my money , the SM-57 is the best all around microphone of the past two generations for stage use and some recording purposes . For studio vocals I 'd use an SM-7 , which really does n't sound all that much different from the SM-57 when the built-in variable EQ on the SM-7 is set the way I like . The SM-57 and it 's predecessors are to me the best all around microphone since 1970 and certainly the most enduring and durable . You can not go wrong unless you get too close with no windscreen .	1
Unique product offering new kind of protection from fingerprints , dust , oxidation , squeaks , or & # 34 ; gummy areas & # 34 ; . 2 or 3 drops on a cotton ball and treat several guitars . This is a thin viscosity lube that shines your woodgrain better than new . I do n't like greasy feeling products on my guitars so Dr . Duck 2080 Ax Wax is designed for my needs . I threw out my Gibson spray . Too oily . Dr.Ducks Wax is worth the extra $ 3 . This bottle will last a lifetime . You could use it on your Johnson if you wack off the finish .	1
Recently I was looking for some heads to put on a set of Starion shells that I modified . My original plan was to use a set of Attack heads on both the resonant and the batter side of these shells . That decision was based mostly on price . Not completely though as I have used the Attack heads for resonant heads with very good results . The Attack heads that I bought though are single ply . To me that make them great candidates for resonant heads but I think a two ply head is better for a batter head . I gave the Attacks a shot on both sides but I was n't completely happy with the sound and felt a two ply head would just be the better way to go.In the past I have used Remo heads for batter heads almost exclusively . I still very much like the Remo Pinstripe heads but decided to give these Evans heads a try just to try something different . I am very happy I did ! These Starion shells now have a very nice sound with lots of resonance . The most noticeable difference between these G2 's and the Attacks is that the tuning range seems to be much wider . The Attacks had a very narrow tonal range where they resonated . The G2 's seem to resonate everywhere ! From very loose to moderately tight they have very nice sound and resonance . I have some Moon Gel damping pads installed to cut down on some of the resonance but doing it this way instead of choking the drum offers a much better sound . By adding , removing , or moving the Moon Gel pads around I can control exactly how much resonance the drums have without having to change the heads tune.I should mention that I am still using the single ply Attacks for the resonant side . With the G2 's on top and the Attacks on the bottom these shells sound great ! Also , on the bass drum I have Attack no ring heads on both sides . I also have a pillow in there for damping and this bass drum sounds just amazing ! So , the Attacks have their place but on the batter side I am very impressed with the sound , tuning range , and ease of tuning of these G2 's . If you 've never tried them , give them a shot , if you have you likely already know what I 'm talking about !	1
I have many lengths of these Hosa cables and have neverhad a problem with them.I am not an active musician , so have not put any of them throughthe riggers of what happens on stage ; so I can not comment on thistype of usage.In my over 40 years ( 10 of them on stage ) I have come to realize , thatyou should ALWAYS have extra cables ( just like strings ) with you , aseven the most expensive cables will sometimes let you down .	1
I was looking for a thin crash on a budget and I gave this company a try and I couldnt be more happy..I had reservations at first but when I installed it on my set and used it today I was very surprised.. It hasa great hissing crash that lingers a bit as a much more expensive cymbal would have . This companyputs out a good cymbal and I have a combination of all of the top line names on my set .	1
I bought this pick holder because I hate putting a pick between my strings to hold it and because you ca n't play with a pick in your strings . I originally thought this thing would be kind of large and go all the way across the headstock . Boy was I wrong . The picture is misleading . This thing is tiny and barely goes across three string . It wedges under neath two strings and you can put two picks ( maybe more if they are thin ) into the wedges on top . Stays in place well and is very convenient.Only negative is I do n't know how long it will hold up . I think maybe a thicker rubber rather than this foam rubber would have held up better . I can see this thing eventually losing tension in the pick holder wedges and dropping picks .	1
This is a fun pick . I play a lot with my fingers and thumb and thought I 'd give this a try . Its great ! I love the tone of this pick striking strings . I love the way it transmits the feel of the strings . More organic than plastic picks . Yes it might crumble on you if you play too hard . I think if you play as hard with this pick as you would with your thumb you 'll be fine . Its a lot of fun and for such a little price can open your playing to different tones for your instrument . Worth a try .	1
I am not going to say this pickup is the best thing since sliced bread , but it is built solidly and built to last . It is simple , practical , and cheap . There are obvious advantages and disadvantages to that . You do n't buy $ 150.00 pickup for a $ 200- $ 300 instrument . Being able to plug in and be self-sufficient ( in most rooms , especially at open mics ) is easier and better than relying on a mic , especially for beginners , because it takes skill and discipline to stay within the mic 's sweet spot . Also , some rooms/PA's/hosts do not work well when trying to mic an instrument . At least a pickup like this has the potential for keeping the sound front and center . ( I will experiment with different instruments & write more about the quality later . ) That said , there is only one piezo element , unlike a K & K ; pickup , for example . So it is limited in giving you optimal sound , no matter where it is placed . Also , in case you can not tell from the image , the soldering connection and wires are exposed on the jack , so it can only be used inside your instrument , which means drilling a hole .	1
This thing is amazing . Love the sound It produces.Well made , like a tank . Real quality.Expect to be using this without any problems for a long long time .	1
Well it 's made nicely , but output is not strong , sensitivity brings notes together , on the bright side but there 's little ciean sustain , i 'm going to work with it more , that 's compressor 's .	1
Blocks noise perfectly , priced better than the local store . fit very well my mic . Awesome ! Great for an amateur , just like me	1
I needed a 9-volt adapter to use with an Danelectro N10B Honey Tone Mini Amp . This was recommended and I am happy with the product .	1
Seems sturdy enough , and no noise issues , so I 'm pretty much satified with it ; it does n't leave the house so I 'm not asking it to handle a lot , but with reasonable care it should last a while .	1
I 've had this for nearly a year and I have no complaints . Works perfectly . Sounds awesome . Lots of gain , tons more than my Boss SD-1 w/the Monte Allums SD808 mod . If lost or stolen , I 'd buy another . Highly recommended .	1
The other reviews for this foot rest called it sturdy and well built . They were right . It can be adjusted to a number of different heights to suit your particular needs - and based on the design of the stand it will stay where it 's put . One of the best parts is that while it is stable enough to be the main foot rest where I play my guitar it can be collapsed flat and it easily fits into a bag or backpack - probably around half of the thickness of a chord book , although heavier , as it is steel with a rubber tread on top . It feels like I will own this for a long time - a well priced , good value.Edit2/2013After owning this for around a year and using it every day I find that it still looks and works like new . I recommend it highly .	1
I 'm happy with this purchase . I bought it during the Black Friday sale . It works for what I use it for . When not in use , it just gets put away . Does n't take a lot of space .	1
This inexpensive pedal kicks ass , provides everything from subtle spring reverb to VAST cathedral-like reverb . The 'Space ' setting is unique in that it adds an interesting modulated overtone a couple octaves above the sounded note , providing a strange harmony . Some people pick on Behreinger because they 're stuff is ( still ) cheap . I admit that two of their pedals ( of the 10 that I have bought ) underwhelmed me . This one is a keeper !	1
For the price , this is one of the best pop filters . It easily clamps onto my stand and does n't move around after I place it . However , there is one problem I 've had with it . It can easily lose grip of the arm holding the filter . What I mean is that , if I pick up the mic , the arm will swivel away . Granted this was caused by me dropping it once , but before it was fine . So for a good price you get a filter that works .	1
I was upgrading all the chrome on a MIM and put this on . Looks better than the plain one . Includes the screws .	1
This Fender amp is the perfect size to practice or take along . It sounds great and I like the headphone and MP3 player hookups . Good value .	1
This Levy 's Jacquard strap is well made and comfortable . It was much cheaper here than any other place on-line or at a brick and mortar . Arrived quite quickly , but a tracking number would 've been nice . Otherwise , no compaints .	1
Not that it 's a huge deal - but I quite prefer this capo over any other capo I 've used . It just has the most solid build quality and the simple pull style of loosening and tightening works better and more quickly than the type that `` snap '' into place.I own several of these now and whenever I mis-place one ( which happens too often ! ) I come back to purchase another.If you 're looking for a capo I highly recommend using this Dunlop model .	1
Bought these for home karaoke and they work great . I also have a weekend DJ business and these work well professionally . Why spend more ? My DJ business includes up to 4 Shure wireless mics at around $ 500 a piece but these inexpensive Nady 's seem just about as good in sound and performance ( very few drop-outs if you stay within 30 feet of the receiver ) . I 'll probably start taking these on gigs since they are so affordable to replace if they break .	1
I bought this for my 1974 Martin D-18 for recording on my PC . So far it is working great . I have a Behringer 802 mixer already and I just plugged the guitar into that . It works perfectly . This guitar is very loud without a pickup , but to get the sound into my PC for recording I either needed to use a mike or a pickup . I chose the pickup . I got too much background noise with the mike.Update : I started to get a loud buzz in my sound system and scratched my head a bit trying to figure it out . I had played my guitar about an hour before without that `` buzz '' being a problem . I discovered that if I turn the guitar a certain way the buzz went away . Then I remembered that the only thing I was doing differently was that I had turned on another overhead light since it was dark outside . I turned that light off and the buzz went away . My pickup was picking up interference from the new type florescent bulbs in the light . I 'm glad there is nothing really wrong with the pickup . ; ) After using the pickup for awhile I have noticed that the 5th and 6th strings are n't as loud as I would expect ; also the 2nd string is louder than all of the strings . I 'm not sure why . It 's not a big deal .	1
All I can say is , , , You should try a set of these Elixir Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings for yourself . You will not want to go back to any other set of strings . I 've been using Elixir strings for many years . They have better feel , sound , and last longer than all other brands I 've used playing Guitar . Elixir has excellent quality control too . I 've never had a problem .	1
I have always liked these sticks . They are solid , look good and feel good . You will always get quality from vic firth . Only downer is they seem to break faster then some sticks such as Vaders .	1
I chose the patriotic design for obvious reasons . It is lovely . Clear shard silk screening . The capo itself is really good . It is very snug on the strings .	1
Right size , well made , and these do the job . I prefer them at 90 degrees , so these are just right .	1
My guitar playing wife loves her super slinky strings . They sound wonderful and cost very little . What 's not to love ?	1
Nice foot switch for the mustang amp . Able to switch from clean to distortion quickly within a song easily . Great quality .	1
great product for the price , I mean they are guitar picks and medium picks at that . Nice gloss finish and the designs on them is pretty cool	1
beyond stoked ! bought so i could teach my son bass ... i cant believe how much sound comes out of this box . ampeg will always build my bass rigs , however big or small	1
Another quality product from Hosa . Just what I needed for an insert patch from my mixer to EQ . I always like slightly longer length as I can always zip tie back but hard to stretch ! No noise from this cable !	1
These are outstanding strings that sound great ; just a littler softer ( to my ears ) than the standard Martin strings . They last longer and are worth the difference in price over regular , non-coated strings .	1
Very versatile tuner . It automatically tunes to the string so you just pick and tune away ! It also shows you chords in case you have forgotten them . There are other things you can do on this tuner and for the price it is a great buy !	1
Was very pleased with JP 600L PB acoustic guitar strings . I wipe the strings with a Planet Waves microfiber cloth each time after playing and it seemed like they would last forever . Plus the tone of the bass strings was improved over the D'Addario EJ16 light I had been using that were installed by the factory , so I kept replacing with like kind . 600L is the exact same string gauges.I read a review on Shorline Music ( an Amazon affiliate ) about the John Pearse 710 NM PB and after trying those I like them even better than the 600L . They keep most of the same bass strings as the 600L ( A , D , and G ) but add some strings from the medium size : low E ( .055 replacing .053 ) and high E and B each increasing .001 , from .012 to .013 , and .016 to .017.I had a concern about my ability to bend the B string using little finger only in blues F chord position - no problem.The improvement in tone is in all the right places . Very nice . Yet the overall tension of the set is increasing only very slightly under 10 pounds total , from the 162.2 lbs . for the D'Addario light.I play fingerstyle only and this set is said to be ideal for fingerstyle offering a balanced tension across all strings.I suppose things are always subject to change , but for now , I am amazed and delighted with these strings . You would n't think a simple string change could make much of a difference , but somehow these do .	1
These are great patch cables . They make a strong connection between pedals and do n't sacrifice any sound quality . I 've been using many of these , every day , for quite a while and they are still working great .	1
This pedal is a must have for any pedal board . I love the overdriven sound of this pedal in that it has a distortion element but not so distorted single notes are lost in the fray . Thirty some odd years and counting and still one of the best .	1
they are cheap to buy and they are nice straps for an acoustic . I am not sure how they would feel on a heavy electric	1
Delivery was Amazon fast , installation took all of 2 minutes and we were making music . It has worked perfectly from the start and as continued without a flaw for the last 6 months , and we expect it to continue for years . For the price you ca n't go wrong . Mic sound is pristine , no noise , we use it for vocal recording in studio , run it off an M-Audio Mixer Keyboard which lacked Phantom power . Top Recommendation .	1
These strings last and they moderated some of the booming I get from other strings . I use the EXP Phosphor bronze on my other dreads .	1
This case is very durable , nice heavy duty zippers and pockets for storage . The 20mm is perfect to protect instrument during travel . The red piping in the picture is more maroon in real life .	1
Hey it 's a pick , it 's 10 to a bag ... .I lost one already so now I have 9 . I my world that 's good stuff .	1
These Fender 10 foot Guitar cables are by far the best bang for your buck ! Every part of these cables are quality .	1
Nice and thick , the adhesive is very strong . I have used it on microphone electronics to shield out RF noise . If you do n't have the shielding grounded , or in a continuous loop , it wo n't work . If you hear hum , it 's not the shielding , it 's your technique .	1
I only use this as a tube amp for vocal . For the price , I can drive 2 mics , and fit it in a 1U space . The tube sound is good enough for live performance for as long as I do n't crank it up too much , it also helps with the gain of the SM58 as it 's much lower than my other Line6 mic . I used to have multiple Studio Projects VTB-1s and ART Tube Pacs but their tubes seem to have died due to old age , and I mainly cared for the tube feature in them , so stepping down to the MIC2200 is fine with me.If you want to get warmer vocal sound , and do n't want to invest too much for it , the MIC2200 is the way to go , imo . However , buying Behringer products always require crossing fingers ( and hope that they last ) . So I 'll update should I encounter problems .	1
I was looking for a strap locking designed button for my acoustic guitar . These work great and look sweet too . Their shape keeps your guitar securely in place , but is also easy to unhook when your ready . High quality product and very easy to install . Just what I wanted .	1
I have tried so many brands of guitar strings in the past 20 years . I just keep coming back to these . The sound is n't quite as bright as the phosphorus bronze , but it is more of a acoustic guitar sound , anyway . These are clear , high quality and come sealed in tight plastic so the strings are n't exposed to air until you open them . Because of that little `` difference '' they do stay clean much longer than the brands simply wrapped in paper . I just ca n't think of a single complaint .	1
This is an excellent gig bag . Plenty of compartments for all of your accessories . Well padded and has enough carrying options . A good buy .	1
None of the problems on/off that plague the Cry Baby . Better sound too ! People are sold on that because of its association with Hendrix . But THIS is the original , and the best . Obligatory .	1
Very comfortable strap . The cotton is soft and does not cut into my neck like some nylon straps do . Seems sturdy and is holiding up well so far .	1
These ( and the extra lights ) are great strings . They felt so good on the guitar after the old set that I had . Now I 'm stuck replacing them often because I love the feeling of new strings . They play great , have nice action and tone . I use them on a Yamaha acoustic and the two together sound great .	1
Now I can create charts no the fly quickly and have perfectly straight lines . 5 frets allows enough room for more complicated chords or even scales . A must have for guitar teachers IMHO .	1
My Hartke 410VX Cabinet was designed by an idiot ... .9 million pounds and no casters ... not even holes for them . Who invented this thing , He-Man ? Anyways , I bought these casters , got out the drill , and punched a few holes in the bottom of my amp , pounded these in , and now it ROLLS . Sadly one of the holes wasnt drilled quite straight making one caster a bit crooked so the amp veers to the right when I push it like a car missing a wheel . But its still better than carrying this beast everywhere my band is playing . Of course , we practice at the drummer 's house and in his basement so I still have to carry it down and up his stairs , but that 's life .	1
these heavy gauge are the main strings I use . Detune great , good harmonics , great presence , I use them across a whole range of genres , from Death metal to Blues to Funk and beyond !	1
If you are like me , my research for a guitar connection to my iPad left me with choosing between the iRiffport and the Jam . I recently purchased , and then returned , the iRiffport . I am very pleased that I purchased the Apogee Jam as a replacement . Here are the reasons why:1 ) The connector on the iRiffport ( the one that goes into the iPad ) is not a strong connection at all ; it feels as though it could disconnect at any time . I have a stand to put my iPad on when jamming such that the iPad is in landscape mode , so the cord feels as though it will come out of moved the wrong way . With the Apogee Jam , the connector is just like the iPad 's connector , except it ALSO has the `` prongs '' that come out of it , securing the connector into the iPad . To remove the connector from the iPad , you need to squeeze the buttons on the connector to make the `` prongs '' go in so it can be removed ... very , very secure . I use the `` Gumdrop '' case on my iPad , which has a flap that goes over the charging port when not being used . This flap feels pretty tawt when it is open while the charging port is being used . IMPORTANT : if you have such an iPad case , like me , I certainly feel that the Jam will provide a much more secure connection to your iPad over the iRiffport . In fact , the structure of the iRiffport connector was so large , that I felt that it did not fit well through my case . On the other hand , the Jam 's connector is the same small size as the iPad 's original connector . This is also something to consider if you intend to use your iPad in portrait mode on a stand with the connector on the bottom of the iPad.2 ) Probably the largest reason I prefer the Jam over the iRiffport : you can hear sound directly from the iPad . With the iRiffport , you MUST use headphones or attach external speakers . I tried headphones with the iRiffport and playing the guitar was very awkward . Nonetheless , with the Jam , I could attach headphones or external speakers to the iPad if I chose to do so . I wanted something that could make my iPad an amplifier for easy mobility around my house , without having to purchase another amplifier or external speakers . With the Jam , I have this.3 ) The Jam has a gain meter ( i.e. , an LED ) and a gain control . The iRiffport does not . When not being used to measure the level of the incoming audio , the LED lets you know if you are connected to the iPad , but not to any software ( blue light ) , or if you are connected to the iPad AND to a software application ( green light ) . There are no batteries needed for the Jam or the iRiffport.4 ) I personally like that I can use my own guitar cord with the Jam . If the cord breaks , I simply replace the cord , not my iPad connection device . The iRiffport uses its own cord , and the connection to my guitar did not feel as strong as my `` normal '' guitar cable I used with the Jam.5 ) Although a fairly minor point , it is nice to know that the Jam is advertised by Apple ( look at their website and their Garageband video ) . And , since I have Garageband on my iPad , I was pleased to see that the advertising material on the Jam states specifically that it works with Garageband.So far , I 'm very pleased with the Jam .	1
I 've been using Nanoweb and Polyweb ( no idea what the difference is ) Elixirs consistently for years now on my Martin Jumbo Cutaway.I periodically try out other brands whenever I see something that might compete , especially when another `` extended life '' or `` coated '' string is released . I would happily bail on Elixir at $ 13 a set if someone offered a cheaper option that worked as well . In fact , I was quite optimistic about the $ 9 D'Addario EXPs until I heard their tone begin to evaporate after a few days like any other string . Nothing that I 've used up to this point has gotten close to challenging the quality of the mighty purple box.The sound you get from these on Day 1 is crisp and beautiful as expected . That 's not where Elixirs kill the competition though . It 's after 20 hours of play that they show their strength . You will still hear fresh , bright tones from them when any other set would have already crossed into the dead zone . In fact , I typically start breaking them before they begin to sound too dull . I play relatively aggressively and use palm-muting constantly , allowing skin oils to eat right through the strings at the bridge.Saying that the tone lasts 3.5x longer ( as stated on the box ) might be a stretch but there is no question that you get at least double the life out of these at less than twice the cost of alternatives.If you are an occasional player or a music shop owner , these are a no-brainer . The coating is extremely effective at combating the effects of time and oxygen exposure . For the everyday , aggressive player you will simply get better tone and longer life.One nit-picky point of criticism : the packaging is an issue for me . WHY would any manufacturer still utilize tree-killing paper envelopes that allow strings to get stale ? I 'm seriously asking ! I 've got to be missing something here . A shred of plastic sealed around all 6 strings is greener , more cost-efficient , and it keeps the strings fresh ( thank YOU D'Addario , I 'll never leave your electric strings ) . I would happily buy Elixirs in bulk if I had faith in their shelf-life . Complaints about these snapping prematurely are probably valid , happening when someone gets a set that 's been sitting around for a while . Think of them as a perishable and buy them from places that move a lot of units ( like Amazon : )	1
This compressor is a must have for my bass guitar rig and is used often in my other musicians ' electric guitar rigs . It 's very basic - two controls and one toggle - but gives quite a bit of punch and allows for a much stronger signal . Both my jazz bass and my Precision Bass sound great through this pedal .	1
Between the blue and the yellow , I have my needs covered . These have a weird feeling when you first get them , like they have powder on them . But within 10 minutes of using it , it 'll stick with you much better . I love these picks .	1
I have had these on a Les Paul for years and just purchased some more for the rest of my guitars . Does what it says it will do - keeps your strap locked on . I have had zero issues with these . The installation takes 2 minutes , and has stood up to countless hours of play . Highly recommended !	1
put it in my Fender dreadnaught and only wish i have held out for the the next step up in quality with the mic as well ... Love it to death , had it pertinently installed and love the sound and the versatility . the built in volume knob it a GREAT tough . I could go on , but there are reviews on you tube that will do a better Job than here .	1
These Dunlop 88 mm picks are the right size , not to big or too small . Been using these for years . Always good to have extras on hand and put into the cases . They never wear out . They are not too stiff or too flimsy . They work good for the sound on the strings . Easy to hold on to .	1
I bought these nickel wound guitar strings for my son . He says thses strings are strong and durable and projects a good sound quality . I purchase these strings a lot for my son ... you ca n't beat the price for these quality guitar strings . An added plus ... they 're made in the USA .	1
I 've had Behringer mikes before , and currently have a couple of XM2000s , which are very reliable and comparable to Shure SM 58s . I saw this three pack of 1800s for $ 40 in a hard case and could n't believe it . I hooked them up right beside the 2000s , and while there is a little difference , it 's not much . The 1800 has a little more high end , but it 's easy to adjust the tone for slightly more bass . The presence is also boosted a little on the 1800 , meaning less reverb should be put in the mix to avoid a tinny sound or the possibility of feedback.For now , I 'm using the matched 1800s as the main mikes for our vocalists , and keeping the older 2000s as backups.I bought the 3 of these for less than the price of one SM 58 . Although the Shure ( and the B 2000 ) is better , the difference is hardly noticeable once the tone and presence are compensated for . I can afford to buy another 3 pack for complete backup.A wise choice for the budget conscious .	1
I 've been using D ' Addario strings for 20+ years to great satisfaction . These flex steels are excellent . Bass tones , response and resonance are superior to my ear . You ca n't go wrong with these guys .	1
Warning the tuners have two bumps instead of one . When I looked at the picture it looked like there was only one but there is two and I didnt find it anywhere in the description . Anyway it just lost one star for that I still put them on my guitar and it looks bad a @ # ! ! ! !	1
Pros : works really well and is easy to use . The sound quality is excellent and bypass works fine , too . It is amazing how you can add layers upon layers without any loss of quality.Cons : it takes a bit to get accustomed to the timing , not lest because the switch is somewhat sticky and requires some extra effort , which has an impact on the timing . Also , the LED is placed too close to the switch , so you tend to cover it up with your foot . They should have put it higher up right next to the dial.Overall impression : The positive aspects completely outweigh the minor negatives . It 's a great and inexpensive looper .	1
No sign of wear and tear . and the holes are really tight , minimizing the likelihood of the guitar breaking free occasionally ( it never once came undone in all these months , not sth you can say about all guitar straps )	1
It 's a good quality case . I would n't check it as luggage when flying , but it 's small so bring it as a carry-on . It 'll protect your mando just fine .	1
Behringer pedals are the value leader in effects pedals . I have four of them and my latest is this compressor sustainer . It is very low noise and perfect for acoustic guitar and bass when leading music in a church setting . I 've had more expensive pedals over the last 25 years of playing , but it 's hard to beat the price features and quality of the Behringer pedals .	1
Great heavy picks , amazingly cheap price . You really ca n't go wrong . I lose my picks continually ( Bermuda Triangle in my Laundry ? ) , and this has been great to have an endless supply ...	1
Very happy with it considering the price point . I 'd buy it again in a heartbeat as long as you do n't need a hard case . Great for the knock around uke though .	1
Does what a strap should- holds guitar fine and is built well for five bucks . I like the unique pattern on this thing too . Came in a timely manner , what else is there to say ? Made in Canada .	1
These and Reds are my favorite acoustic strings . These are a little brighter than Reds and are best for live playing . The strings are well made and I 've never had an issue with quality .	1
What to say about this except that they mounted properly , came with the right screws and I didnt have any issues . LOL	1
I bought this to tote my POD HD500 around . It fits snugly , but well . The accessory pocket can fit the power supply and the plastic Line 6 expression pedal . The shoulder strap makes me feel important . it respects my arm 's desire for freedom of movement . My only qualm is that it 's Gator brand , and gators remind me Florida . I 'd rather just pretend that Florida did n't exist .	1
This is my second Fender Polish Cloth . They are basic , but that 's all I need for a quick wipe down of my instrument after I 'm done playing . The only slight negative is the fact that they tend to unravel around the edges . Even though this has happened to me , it did n't keep me from buying the second one . The fact that they are basic and inexpensive is good enough for me . It gets softer with time and use . Overall I have to say that I 'm satisfied with the Fender Polish Cloth .	1
I prefer this design that is fitted to hold the exact size of a diatonic compared to the style that is made to fit any size . Great quality , lasts forever . You wo n't be dissapointed .	1
I ordered this as a spare and at this time , I have n't used it . My microphone came with it 's own cable and this was for a & # 34 ; What if & # 34 ; situation . I gave it 4 stars on just expectation .	1
Its one great modeler , i like the tweed that old tube sound and mic position on cabinets.I am using this with bass , gives you a really clean treble and distortion if you like also , try it with bass you will like it.rock on .	1
Yes , it 's cheap plastic . Yes , the battery life is very short as this unit sucks the life out of a battery in a couple of hours . Yes , the battery is difficult to replace . However , this is the best sounding cheap reverb pedal on the planet . I solved the battery problem by using a 1-Spot 8-outlet pedal power supply . It does n't sound nearly as cheap as its construction or price might suggest . Everything from simulated spring reverb to endless caverns is here , and it all sounds great . It even has a `` modulated '' reverb , which is a reverb with a slight flange/chorus affecting the reverb signal only ( not the dry signal ) which is their version of the Holy Grail 's `` Flerb '' setting . This is about 1/3 the cost of the Holy Grail , and the foot switch should hold up well under normal stage use ( unless of course , you are an elephant ) . For all the complaining I hear about this and other pedals with `` cheap plastic cases '' , I have yet to hear about anyone actually breaking one while using it . Behringer pedals are hit and miss , but this one is certainly a hit .	1
Sounds a lot more than what you expect , this is my 2nd Honeytone ( one at home , one at work ) . You can use it with batteries or with a 9V adapter , it has a clip to hang it on your belt or wherever you want , it also has a headphones input . It gets way to distorted at high volume , but come on ... it 's a $ 20 amp ; it does what it has to and does it well .	1
These strings fit the Bill perfectly for `` MY '' desired sound from a Yamaha LJ-16 Acoustic Guitar which has been `` Doctored '' with Bone Saddle , Pins and nut . When I decided to put the money into the guitar , it was my belief that the Elixir Strings would continue to provide the sound and feel that I like so much in the LJ-16 and after all the work was completed ... ... that proved to be true to form . I did move to the Medium for a little improvement from the Bass side and it 's a most outstanding sound from a medium price , hand crafted guitar . Elixir has the best ( most comfortable ) feel , to me , of all the strings that I 've tested and these provide the best ( for my liking ) sound on this guitar . Try them if it 's quality sound that you 're looking for ... ... ... ... ..These are great ! ! ! !	1
These trees came in Fender packaging and fit just as the old ones did and look the same . They have the same locating pin in front of the screw and are the finishing touch in refurbishing my guitar .	1
I bought it for my church and the drum sounds great ... I love The quality and the sound ... Buy it without doubts	1
It 's really hard to beat this product for the price . I found it sturdy , well built , and a great fit for my guitar . I really appreciate the low , wide stance , which is great insurance against accident prone guitar players such as myself !	1
This is a great cymbal stand sturdy , tight , well made , using it with a 18 & # 34 ; crash and does not move or rattle , amazingly well constructed stand for the price , going to replace my other flimsy stands with a few of these , great product . I am not a giging drummer and do not take apart and dismantle the stand at all , but it is a great stand for my studio/practice kit . Being honest do n't know how it would be for a gigging drummer , but for what I am using it for , more than does the job .	1
Nice padded seat , well constructed . good padding for comfort , I go 190lbs . Heavy duty base , lots of adjustment if needed . love Amazon , why shop anywhere else ?	1
The mic has loud voice in my Karaoke . The stand makes my setting professional . You feel different when there is a stand holding the mic .	1
Aquila strings will never let you down . Highly recommended by all serious Ukulele players . Italian made , need I say more .	1
It 's obviously modeling the boss super chorus but still sounds almost as good just not as clear	1
I seem to have problem with getting it to & # 34 ; hear & # 34 ; low E ( of all strings ) but it is very compact and convenient to use .	1
I 've been using HOSA cables for quite a few years and find them to be professional quality and very dependable without being overpriced . I particularly like the right angle plug . It works well on most guitars except Strats and Strat style guitars . That 's still not a problem because I simply put the right angle plug in the amp and the straight plug in the guitar . This cable is far more flexible than plastic coated cables . I 'm very pleased with it and recommend it .	1
I love BOSS pedals . I owned a DS-1 ( Distortion ) and a MT-2 ( Metal Zone ) for years , and loved them both . This one , is a good `` meet in the middle '' of those two . It 's great if you want some really good bluesy distortion , or you can crank the color and get some thick distortion.As always , this pedal is very well constructed and sturdy . I love it .	1
Clayton 's rule ! Been using since they debuted and will never change to anything else.Long lasting and great tone besides.Awesome.yes , indeed.khjghjjh hgkjhgk	1
TC makes very high quality pedals , and this thing is built like a tank . I 've had it for over 2 years and done many gigs , and a couple tours and all my TC pedals are in perfect condition . Now for tone , this overdrive is a light overdrive and works really well for me when I 'm leading worship n my band , we play heavier music , so I was messing around with this overdrive so I could use it there as well , and I discovered that if you try to use it as a boost pedal , it makes your tone really muddy , but if you send a dirty tone ( overdrive or light distortion ) into it , it screams beautifully .	1
I bought this for my teen son for Christmas . He loves to play his bass and sing along . He had a different Shure mic and it was totally flat compared to this particular model . Nice and clean sounds , plus it seems pretty sturdy . We did get him a mic stand and it fits on it perfectly and stays put . Shure knocked this one out of the park .	1
This amp cable is perfect . It fits my need for practicing . It 's just the right length for sitting on the couch , strumming daily . I would like this one for each amp I own so I 'm not always taking it from amp to amp . I will buy some more of these.The cable also looks nice and completes the Fender look . I would highly recommend this and give it a no-brainer 5 star rating . I have nothing negative to say about this .	1
I 've been playing for more than 30 years . There are a lot of great products out there and I 've tried a lot of them . I have to say that the feel and tone of these grey Dunlop Gatorgrip 2mm picks surpasses the Dunlop yellow gels , Fender 351 X-heavies , and Golden Gate or Dawg mandolin picks . This is just my opinion , but I hope you 'll check them out because I 'm sure you wo n't be disappointed !	1
for the price and options u can not beat this pedal , i just sound great with acoustic or electric guitar . thank u guys your pedals really kick butt !	1
I had a custom-made pedalboard , made with wood also , it was great in therms of protecting my pedals and with the space but maan it was heavy , only with 7 pedals and that was getting me problems with my back and shoulders ... with this i have 13 pedals and i wont say that its not heavy bcuz it is , but is the same weight but i got 13 pedals ! ! Thats a huge difference ... . the only thing that i maybe dont like is the bag , i know it wont last A LOT OF TIME , but in general is the best pedalboard ive had and i wont change it.. maybe for another bigger like the pt3 but still gon na get pedaltrain ... the best	1
I have a lot of guitars and do all the work on them myself.A couple of secrets to installing the mike pickup : After you drill the hole , and are trying to figure out just how to get thejack into place from the inside of the guitar , do this ; Get a guitar/patch cable and run it through the hole you just drilled until you can grab it throughthe sound hole . jack into the AXL and then pull it out the hole using your cable . You may have to dothis a couple of times to get the jam nuts set for the right depth , so having a way to make this processeasier is a big help . Also , I did not use the giant endpin collar that came with the assy , as it just takesup a lot of thread space to accomplish nothing.Finding a sweet spot on smaller guitars/ukulele/mandolin 's can be close to impossible because the soundhole is actually so small , you ca n't get your hand in , and finger length is as far as you can go , so in most cases , go in the direction of the low E string side as this is what is typically lacking on the smaller instruments unless you have Jimi Hendrix hands and in that case , congratulations.Finally , on Travel guitars ; GET RID OF THE GIANT STRINGS THAT COME ON SOME OF THESE THINGS ! My SX traveller came in with 11-54 's and I could not even hear the low E string . I had an old set of electric 10-46 's I took off of a BB King Lucille , and just for the heck of it swapped them out ; Man what a difference ; actually so much difference that I really did n't need the AXL I just installed even though it 's a fun addition.As far as an amp , I have a little HoneyTone that has been feeling out of place alongside my very large amp arsenal , and just may have found a home , as it is about as small as you can get to go along with the Travel guitar .	1
These work much better than standard stamped trees . No problem with Ernie Ball strings going out of tune quickly.I did notice in Guitar Center , some of those spendy & # 34 ; American Strats & # 34 ; have the cheap stamped out trees , and non-locking tuners .	1
I bought this for my hercules fold up stand and it works great . There are 2 light sources and each has a choice between 1 or 2 lenses for brighter or softer light . The plug-in accessory is great , and my pedal board has an outlet . It runs fine on batteries also . Very pleased .	1
Quick release around the neck strap system . Unbeatable for acoustic , especially since so many acoustics are neck heavy . I would recommend this to anyone . & # 8203 ;	1
This mic works great for recording vocals on my Mac using Garage Band . I also wanted to use it on my Xbox 360 to play Guitar Hero and Rock Band , but it 's not recognized by either game as a mic . That was surprising since it 's a USB mic . It is a tiny mic ; it 'll fit completely on your palm , but it can record very loud noises very clearly . It is also very sensitive when set to room recording . Excellent product .	1
I use these in my home studio as INSERTS and they work great . No complaints.On a side note , I always clean all my cables with CAIG DeoxIT Gold G5 Spray Contact Conditioner 5 oz.and hightly recommend it to all musicians , you will hear the differnce . I also spray a q-tip and and clean all the jacks on my guitars and instruments .	1
Excellent ! Mother 's Little Helper ! Highly recommend this item . It a rubber like stuff and will not damage the instrument . A Must .	1
A bit heavy and does n't fold up to be very compact but its not like there are any better options out there so ... Would love an aluminum one that could fold up real compact but ...	1
I always buy the gross pick package and this is a damn good deal . Never had such colorful ones though : ) If you need picks do the math . It pays . ships fast as always .	1
I 've used so many guitar cables over the years that I lost count . It 's hard to find a tough , low noise cable for less than ten bucks anywhere , but this one is the best one out there for the price paid . Its made well , with strong plug ends and a thick yet flexable cable covering that I love . I use it for all of my equipment connections , and it simply works with no problems and no noise that I could detect . Try it out , you 'll discover the same as me and my band mate 's have , that this is the best cable for the money on Amazon !	1
I bought this and am very satisfied with the quality and construction . One of the features I like is that it just does n't take up too much room , and can be placed in its carrying bag which makes it wasy to store.Over all a nice easy to use poratble music stand .	1
I had just bought an electric acoustic and while I was ordering that I just went ahead and picked one of these up as well because I figured what the heck it 's under $ 20 and maybe my full size acoustic might work well with it . So I got it and th only thing I had an issue with is that it slide around a little too easily , but , it does work well . I recommend it for those who are looking for a simple solution to making their acoustic , electric so that they can play it through their amp .	1
Bought bass case for strat , wanted extra space.as the lining is q memory foam and holds the instrument gently in place it also acts as the lid for the open space.I keep several music/note . Books under the head stock.other reveiwer complained of the excess space but that 's what I wanted . It did have chemical smell but as I open items in garage , near trash can for the packaging.it aired in a few minutes . Totally happy with service and product .	1
I recently bought this for my first electric guitar and I thoroughly enjoy it . It has a lot of power and noise behind it . It is a little starter amp , just in case the picture was a little deceiving . I cranked it up quite loud and it produces clean sound without terrible distortion . With distortion , it sounds great . It is a solid piece of work , and it makes a great practice amp and possibly a great starter amp .	1
i like these kind of picks because they have some grip to them , normal picks i use slip out of my fingers some times but these dont.if you hate droping your pick while playing , get these .	1
quiet , almost hum free - clear respose - no volume control does n't befront me because i use it to record & to play thru a PA where either I or someone else keeps the volume under control . It tends to be bass heavy , but a slight eq revisit more than compensates for that . I had used one in the past , this is a more solid unit & fits movement free in the soundhole of my guitar & also in two others i use here and there . great job . great value . got herre quick in a nice little carry bag & I will update if problems come later - do n't see why or how tho	1
This design is a big improvement over string swings ' past designs head stock fits snugly in the well made cradle . quality wood constructtion and the rubber material used feels nice to the touch . I will buy more if I get another guitar .	1
I have always hated tuners ; I would rather use tuning fork on the A string and go from there . Most tuners are too cumbersome and require large batteries or external power ( pedals ) . In addition I could n't use those on my acoustics . Snark solves all of these problems . The display is colorful and easy to read and hides neatly behind the headstock . There is also a visual tap metronome that shows a beating heart in sync with the tempo . I can easily move it from electric to acoutic , and Amazon 's pricing is so low I am considering getting one for each of my guitars . This is one of the few 5 star ratings I 've given any product on Amazon and I rate a lot .	1
After years of having a large , awkward tuner I was thrilled to learn about this modest little clip on . So much more discreet to do a little last minute tune up when you 're already on the stage.I love that the lights are bright and easy to see , unlike one previous tuner I had that was very hard to read . Dark grey letters on a light grey screen . Even better is that the light colors are different for flat , sharp and on-tune which makes it even easier . May not seem like a big deal when you 're tuning alone at your house , but when you 're on a stage with other people doing a lot of last minute adjustments and your attention is all over the place , those little details really help.The only real drawback I see in the design is that there is no place on the head of my 6 string acoustic where I can conveniently clip this without it being somewhat in the way of the tuning knobs . Not impossible , but not terribly convenient , either . It was seemingly designed with an electric style in mind where the knobs are more often in one straight line than on either side of the guitar head.The $ 80 tuner I bought 20 years ago is a Sabine , and quite frankly , 20 years later it still works as well as it did when I bought it . In fact , the price has come down and I bought another one to keep in a different guitar case . Now that I have this one I still use the Sabine more at home , but like this one better on stage because it 's low profile . Looks more professional and I like that .	1
Works great for what it is designed for	1
Every time I have ever used a desk mike , I 've always had to lean into it because the stand was too short . This little stand adjusts about six inches , so it 's possible to get the mike right at mouth level without bending over .	1
awesome patch cables for your pedalboard . they are not as rigid as your typical patch cables which works for winding in and around pedals easier and you can twist and angle them however you want without stressing your input jacks . love Planet Waves gear .	1
This is the # 1 mic you should get , recording or live , instruments or voice , it always come through with a great sound and seems almost indestructible.looking forward to work with it on future projects , ca n't believe it took me so long to get one of those	1
For 30 bucks this mic is great ! I have garage band and needed a mic for voice and room recording , well this mic does it and them some . The different modes are distinct and perfect from podcast to vocals and for room jams . It comes with a long cable , rotating bad , and a nice carry case that fits in my pocket . BUY this mic , for 30bucks you will , be surprised	1
First it tunes very accurately . Second its low profile , I keep it tucked under the head stock , the crowd ca n't really see and I it is completely usable if I need to quickly tune during the set and my ears are n't cutting it . Third , buy it if you are looking for a new tuner .	1
I 'm a big believer and long time user of many different types of visual tuning devices . I play guitar , mandolin and ukelele . And this inexpensive tuner is the best one I 've ever used by a long way . I 've paid a lot more for a lot less . It has an option to use either an internal vibration sensor via the clip or a built in microphone . The dial is easily readable and adjustable to a wide range of viewing angles . And it has the fastest and best response of any tuner I 've ever used . It does n't require a loud volume to `` hear '' the tone . Finally , it does n't seem to wander around trying to attune itself to the note you just played , but it does instantly sense very fine differences in that tone . If I detune by about 1/16th of a turn on my tuning machine ( an difference I ca n't hear with my own ear ) , this device detects it immediately . All in all , this thing is a whole step up in accuracy in tuning .	1
need to learn to read , since I have bought two other sets with a wound C string , , so bought these because I was having alot of trouble with my tenor uku my wife bought for me for Xmas , , have since made a new nut and saddle to fix ( ok bandaid ) a high third fret which also I have sanded down and now is lining up with the others..	1
Versus the Godlyke , I 'd say this is the better purchase . Though the Godlyke product claims 2000mA of power ( 2amps ) , this is slighlty less at 1.7mA ( 1700mA or 1.7amps ) . Anyway , if your drawing that much juice using your pedal board , you may want to re-consider what you are using . The product itself is plastic , but seems solid , I believe it will hold up to repeated use no problem . Being plastic though , you do have to be careful not to drop it or have it stepped on or rolled over , etc . I do like the fact that it does have a heavier gauge wire than the Godlyke product and seems slimmer so it will fit more readily into '1 spot ' as advertised . The heavier wire means that when someone rolls in their 4x12 cab your power supply cable will have a higher chance of survival . The extender that comes with is good , seems about as generic in length and space between connections as you can get . I only wish it came with two of them . I am using a Pedaltrain Pro board and at 32.9 inches , it will require a pair of the extensions to get to all the pedals . The combo pack also includes some other adapters for those odd pedals that refuse to conform and use 1/8 '' power connections , some 9 volt adapters for pedals with out any external power . One thing I have not checked yet is the actual output of the supply . A lot of companies think that if their voltage is 'close ' to 9 volts , thats good enough . The reality is that this is an indication of poor quality control and lack of intrest in producing a quality product . You will find some higher end devices specifically warn NOT to use anything higher than 9 volts so 9.6 volts is n't 'close enough ' . Anyway , while I have not checked the output of the adapter yet , I did fire it up on all the pedals I could power with the one extension that came with and everything worked nice and quiet . It is amazing how having a good quality power source can help eliminate some buzz and other 'noise ' from your signal chain . I 'd buy this again and in fact I may buy another just as a back up . It is a tad pricey at thirty bucks ... feels more like a twenty five dollar item given the all plastic construction but , all in all , a good buy over the competition .	1
That 's why I got this ... I needed light without the heat ! It works fine . Just sorry it 's a little pain to keep taking battery out if I want to use the AC connection . Other than that , it 's fine , and pretty well constructed . Seems to take a few bangs without problems !	1
I like a lot this pedal . It 's has a deep overdrive . I 'm using 18Vdc to supply power , and it deliverys a fat overdrive . I 'm using a TS808 in front of OCD ...	1
I have a small apartment in a small but densely populated apartment complex - space and noise is an issue . As a beginning guitarist , I contemplated a small amp but decided on the Mini Tone Master ( because in my apartment , the smaller the better ) . Also , I had no need for ample volume or a variety of controls being at the level that I am ... I just wanted something no-frills that was small , compact with enough quality sound to help me as I practice . The Mini Tone Master delivers well.I was pretty surprised at the range of sounds the little guy can produce ( from distortion grungy to a softer bluesy tone ) . It does not come with a power adapter but we already have on in the apartments and works well with that or with a battery . Battery life is also pretty good . I 've had the same battery in there for several months already , playing several times a week and sometimes leaving it on accidentally for a day or two and no signs of battery drain so far.It is a little frustrating sometimes , as another reviewer mentioned , to remove the distortion but with enough fiddling , I found a setting that was acceptable to my ears.While I did n't need volume , this little guy can be loud ! No weakness there.I also plugged an acoustic-electric classical guitar into the mini tone master and it also worked surprisingly well .	1
I have found that everything Schaller make 's is Grade A- # 1 in My book . Made in Germany ( NOT China ) these locks are fast and secure . I like the way they slide on & off which if Your like Me having to change Guitar 's during a show or just at home , the change is smooth and safe . No dropping guitar 's around here ! ! ! I have them on all My guitar 's .	1
Noisy as any compressor but after using it I do n't wan na go back to not having one for my setup .	1
I needed a cable to go from my mic to the floor , just to plug in a delay effect ( our PA does n't have an effects loop ) .This is just what the doctor ordered.I just toss it in my gig bag with my vocal effects pedal and run the regular XLR from the pedal to the PA and I 'm in business. [ ... ]	1
I love my Levy 's Jacquard Straps . They are colourful . I have purchase 2 to see how they were . This one to match with my black Ovation 1861- Balladeer and another to match with my Ovation Maple top CC44 . I now have another one for my new Ovation 12 String CC245 just ordered this week from Amazon.The straps were chosen to match with the guitar colours and my wife thinks that they are awesome and will certainly be talked about by the ladies around when I play my guitars.They tightly fit around the guitar buttons and the shoulders . I have no regrets with the purchases and I truly recommend those straps to anyone .	1
My son has been a guitarist for seven years and loves these strings . Not a single one has broken since he started using these three weeks ago . These strings tend to repel the dirt and dust even with heavy play the strings look very good . He has been getting less callous on his fingers . The tone produced by these stings is very good especially considering the low price . My son has a very heavy hand but these strings are well made and withstand play from any style .	1
These are really cheap strings but how they sound ! ! really good ! ! obviously not for serious live performing but for playing with friends or just rehearse , these are the ones !	1
Fast Fret , or at least some kind of string cleaner is a 'must have ' for anyone who plays guitar . Because , if you think about it , strings get really dirty over time , and this product solves that issue . : )	1
While I do n't have a ton of experience with pedals , I really love this one . Keeps your guitars tone but you can add some fatness and a mild to fairly substantial crunch and adds some nice sustain . Although this is a tube-overdrive I actually think it sounds better with my solid state amp . It is nothing real drastic but that is exactly what I was looking for , a nice robust boost while keeping your guitar tones integrity . For the price I do n't see how you can beat this pedal . I also have a Digitech Jam Man and it is awesome . No complaints with this outfit .	1
For those of you going for the folk singer look , or if you 're afraid of drilling holes in your guitar , this is definitely the thing to buy to strap your guitar .	1
Cost efficient . perfect for a guitarist who loses or wears out picks easily . like it alot . will probably buy more next year ; )	1
I have heard good things regarding this pedal so I was always interested , but never pulled the trigger on purchasing it . When a buddy of mine who happens to be a professional musician began talking about it , I said I think I 'd better check this out.IM GLAD I DID ! boys and girls time to break open the walletsgreat tone and drive within this little boxyou 'll be adding it to the board just like I did	1
I really like this tuner . it works very well . once you understand what you are supposed to be looking for on the tuner ( ie. , the moving black squares to no longer move ) , then tuning is a simple and accurate thing . it works great on all of my guitars , acoustic and electric . comes in a very cool metal box which protects it nicely when traveling or not using it . it cause a few bucks , but I think it is so much better than the other less expensive clip ons , that it is worth it .	1
This bit of leather and a button spared my acoustic surgery to add a second strap mount . I am happy with the function and it looks good in combination with an Ernie Ball strap . The raised star on the button adds a touch of design interest .	1
I have purchased about 5 of these in the past 4 years . I have found no major issues with any of them . Expect to do a small amount of fretwork , such as filing and finishing some of the fret ends , checking the frets for crowns , filing those down and polishing the frets . As with any neck , even the high dollar ones , the truss rod will likely need minor adjustment after it is strung and set up . They come unfinished but well sanded . I sand a bit extra , but one could spray it out of the box . I like to use 3 coats of amber and 6 to 9 coats of clear lacquer , satin or semi gloss . None of these are select quarter sawn wood , but they are an excellent bargain for anyone wanting to build a guitar or replace a broken neck on an instrument .	1
What can you say about something that you need but is really insignificant in the scheme of things . I needed it and it works simple as that	1
... is a must if you have any of the Danelectro/FAB pedals . As anyone who has one of these pedals knows they eat 9-volts like candy , this is the solution . You get one of these and hook it up to a power splitter ( Search for Visual Sound One Spot Multi-Plug 5 Cable ) and you are good to go for up to 5 pedals ! No more battery swaps , no more searching for a 9-volt every 5 minutes ...	1
A great item for the price . Comes in two pieces and is easy to assemble . You only need to put in the two screws that attach the head to the stand . Each screw has a wing nut that you tighten by hand . It took me about 3 minutes to put together with no directions . It looks to be very solid and goes much higher than many other stands . Its also pretty lightweight and as I said the head comes off with two screws if you want to break it down for traveling . I am very satisfied with my purchase .	1
I compared this side by side with two other reverbs-1 ) The Boss '63 Fender reverb2 ) The Electro Harmonix Holy Grail.I found the EH- Holy Grail the most natural sounding and the simplest to operate with only 1 knob and one switch.The TC pedal did sound nice , but to my ears slightly sterile by comparison to the Holy Grail.I thought the Boss pedal sounded pretty bad.Pros of the pedal : - several settings and with all the knobs , highly adjustable- mono or stero ( 2 inputs , 2 outputs ) - standard 9 volt power supply jack used by most pedals- I liked the spring reverb , and the `` mod '' reverb which was lush.Cons : - Sounded a little sterile compared to EH Holy Grail , but close and still good- I thought the number of different reverb settings was actually overkill and just there to look like it did a lot . To my ears , the rest were less distinctive.-Priced at $ 150 , seemed a little high although I know there are other pedals that cost more.Overall a nice pedal , I ca n't really ding it for the cons above so I still gave it 5 stars . I had to compare a couple times to the EH holy grail to make my decision . In the end , the grail was cheaper , simpler and sounded more like a real reverb tank in my opinion .	1
I purchased one of these about 6 months ago for my partner who is a musician because we had no recording equipment in the house . We did n't really expect much except a quick way to record ideas.It 's simple , easy to use and has outstanding quality of sound . We 've used it to record acoustic guitar and vocals with surprisingly good fidelity . We 've recorded whole ensemble practice sessions with the mic which it 's really not designed for and still had reasonable results . Our friends who are musicians ( and even an audio engineer ) are quite surprised and impressed with the quality of sound we get.I 've even ordered a second mic for my computer to use with skype.To sum it up , this mic is cheap , easy to use , portable and with fidelity that will surprise you but do n't expect it to be a full home recording studio : )	1
these dunlop straploks are amazing ! never had them fail on me , and always gave me a good piece of mind knowing that my guitar is safe from hitting the floor on stage or at home , they stay secure when done properly , I 've looked at other strap locks and tried some others but the dunlop ones just seem to work , and work well .	1
This is 10 watt walkman size guitar amplifier . The controls are Volume/ off , Tone , and overdrive . It also has a headphone jack . In my honest opinion , it is a good headphone amplifier to use when to need to practice without disturbing people around you . The speaker sound is fine for a clean sound ( like jazz , or country ) or semi distorted and more ( rock ) . If your looking for an small amp . that will do metal this may not be for you . Defintely get the Danelectro DA-1 AC power adapter instead of batteries because you may go through them quick . Overall it 's pretty good .	1
These are great guitar straps at a very reasonable price ! ! I bought 2 to try them out , and I intend on buying more ! !	1
Works as advertised . I was a bit skeptical when the product arrived , but I just set up my acoustic guitar with this product and it does work . Pretty simple , even if you 're `` technically challenged . '' Easy to use . Have n't gigged with it yet , but I can imagine that this strap `` is n't going anywhere , '' regarding its functionality . Not a `` pretty '' product , but good stuff .	1
the snark series of tuners are the best small tuners I have found , I have both the the SN-1 and SN-2 for my guitar and mandolin respectively , when buying be sure to get the correct one for the instrument you are going to use it on , if not sure which , get the SN-2 ( red ) one it generally will work for all instruments .	1
I 've been using Dunlop Nylons for almost as long as I 've been playing guitar ( twenty one years now ) . I find the .60 's are just a bit too thin , but for more chord strumming style playing , such as playing rhythm , the .73 's are perfect . They are flexible , but not flimsy . The tips will wear down after a while as with all picks . I estimate that a solid thirty to forty hours of playing is all you 'll get with a pristine tip . However , they 're definitely still usable after that . One other advantage these picks have is that they never break . So , i dont see how you can go wrong .	1
It is a little light if you bump it anything that you store in the top goes everywhere when the rest falls on the floor . As long as the guitar is on it works great .	1
My first Kala Ukulele had these strings on it from the factory and I 've never switched brands . Everywhere you read , these are the strings to have !	1
This little stand collapses and sets up so easy . Holds my guitar perfectly . May buy one for my dad next !	1
These D'Addario Medium Acoustic Guitar Strings come as individually packaged sets of three , with the necessary six strings in each set . Being new to guitars , we had no idea how often the strings would need to be replaced so this three pack seemed like a good starting point.The strings are good quality , produce accurate tones ( according to our auto-tuner ) , and have held up well.Highly RecommendedCFH	1
I would n't recommend tuning these strings to E however , because the intense amount of tension it takes to tune these to E can cause permanent damage to the neck that not even the truss rod can fix . The highest I feel comfortable tuning these to is E flat . If you are doing anything at or below Drop C sharp , these strings will work out great for you .	1
Nice overall , with a good sustained ring from the steel strings ( 1-2 ) and a bit of a metalic sound on the wound strings ( 3-6 ) . I like the sound I get on my Yamaha acoustic .	1
When I plugged this into my computer and keyboard , it said one MIDI device detected , but I was not getting sounds from my piano onto my computer . I simple took the MIDI in and the MIDI out and switched them , and the problem was instantly solved . If your MIDI is not working right , try what I did , switching the cables to the opposite side . Sounds ridiculous , but it might save you a bit of time . : D	1
Fine product ! i 've been using it for 1 monthno dirty thread or any issue with itleather is bit tough at first time	1
It 's hard to find a good clip-on tuner that 's accurate and visible in all situations . The Snark SN-8 ( B ) is my favorite so far . It 's really bright , more accurate that other Snarks , and ( despite other reviews saying it breaks easily ) I 've found it to be sturdy enough considering how flexible it is . Again , it 's a clip-on tuner so do n't expect razor-sharp accuracy . But it does a good enough job for what it is . It 's quick and convenient . If you need something more accurate I recommend investing in a good pedal . I 've found the swivel to be a nice feature that makes it easy to see the display . I do n't typically use the metronome feature , but it 's nice to have it . Overall , my favorite Snark model and my favorite clip-on tuner .	1
Using this for a PRS electric guitar with satisfactory results . Easy to set up . Sturdy enough for repeated use . No worries about using this with an expensive instrument . Simply put , it 's well made and works great .	1
First of all , 20 ft is not too long . Better to have a little bit of extra length than too short . The cable works fine and is very flexible . Also looks nice and is easier to track than plain black ones . Recommended !	1
great stuff to have for a great price & # 8230 ; i like it ! highly recommend to everyone must have for those who loves to play guitar .	1
Thsese are the perfect size for my Jazzmaster . Too bad the seem to get dirty so quickly . Maybe my hands are just sweaty	1
I bought this for my Taylor 714 . It seems to keep things humidified very well . I like the idea that it takes moisture out and puts moisture in as needed.I have replaced packs twice . I have not had any problems with the packages leaking or creating any problems in the guitars .	1
These patch cords work like a champ . I use them with my pedal board , and have n't any issues with signal quality . They give some versatility in their length . I can move the cords around without having to move my pedals too much . The colors ... .well ... ok , they 're a little odd , but for the price , I dealt with it .	1
Trying out a few new types of picks and different weights . I found this pick very responsive , flying through the scales on my Les Paul . The pick 's weight was perfect . It 's durable and easy-gripping .	1
I 've read some complaints about this unit . Maybe those folksshould shell out an additional $ 300 for something better.To the rest of you , with the 99 storage units , this is a great tool.My band , I to be exact , uses this to store backing tracks for songswe play . For instance , one of our songs has a difficult drum track.I just loaded the whole pre-recorded track into a slot.Or , one of our songs has a train whistle in the background . I loadedthe effect into a slot.Or , another song we do needs birds tweeting and children laughingand playing in the background . I recorded the track and loaded it intoa slot.Basically any instrument or sound effect accompaniment you need , butdo n't have someone else to play it , you can play it back using this device .	1
The BAD MONKEY overdrive pedal does not produce `` Crazy Train '' metal distortion . It is n't made to , and thus if you buy it for that sound you 're off target . ( If that 's the sound you want , I recommend : DigiTech TL-2 HardWire Metal Distortion Extreme-Performance Pedal . ) What the BAD MONKEY produces is delicious , bluesy overdrive at a highly competitive price ( it currently sells for $ 49.95 here at Amazon ) . Unlike so many overdrive/distortion pedals , the BAD MONKEY has independent ( and sensitive ) dials for treble ( `` high '' ) and bass ( `` low '' ) , and using them can greatly affect the resulting sound ; they are by no means token dials . In particular , the bass dial can be used to increase bass to an amazing degree ( especially when using double-coil pickups ) ; it 's easy to achieve a `` fat '' sound with this pedal . The pedal does not come with , but does accept , an external power supply ( i.e. , an adapter ) . It can also be powered with a 9V battery , which is installed under what 's literally the pedal portion ( just as in BOSS pedals ) . The BAD MONKEY is made of metal and can be used as a weapon if so needed . It seems extremely rugged , again like BOSS pedals . I have several overdrive/distortion pedals , but I find myself turning to this one again and again . My impression of the BAD MONKEY is based on using it with [ i ] an Ibanez guitar with good double-coil pickups , [ ii ] an Ibanez guitar with good single-coil pickups ( similar to `` soapbar '' style , or P-90 , pickups ) , and [ iii ] a Fender Mustang II amp . It works well with both single- and double-coil pickups . If I lost my pedal , I would order another right away . I 've been playing for over 30 years and can say with confidence that this is a great pedal .	1
I have purchased two sets of the Mini Locking Rotomatics . No more winding string wraps around the tuning post . Fastest string change ever . Insert string , wind about a half turn , and the string is locked in the tuner . No more slipping out of tune . Rotomatics will go on every guitar build I do .	1
The delay pedal was inexpensive and it works . I dont find a lot of variance in the adjustments , but it does the job it was made for . The case may be plastic but it appears quite rugged .	1
I actually own an even dozen of these . I 've never had any issues with them marring the finish on my acoustic guitars . They work great & you ca n't beat the price . I think I paid around $ 4.95 for most of the ones I purchased . Although these are great & I will continue to use them as needed ( e.g. , when playing ) , I just replaced these today with Swing String Wall Hangers . I freed-up so much of my floor space by moving 12 guitars to the wall that I was actually excited about all the free space ! ! !	1
This is an amazing guitar for the price . I wanted a classical guitar to round out my collection . The guitar has good tone and action . The built in tuner is a nice addition because nylon strings stretch when they are new so you have to retune frequently . The guitar stays in tune nicely after the strings are broken in . The pickup works nicely but is a little sensitive and loud . The guitar sounds good both acoustically and amplified , but I prefer the acoustic sound . The finish is a bit more orange than pictured . You could spend a lot more money on a classical guitar and not end up with a better guitar than this one .	1
Great strings , I use Ernie Ball strings on all 7 of my guitars , both acoustic and electric and never had a complaint . I have experimented with others but always come back to them .	1
The MXR Phase 90 is a classic stompbox popularized by Eddie Van Halen . At present , I own an MXR Phase 90 , a Boss PH-3 Phase Shifter , and a Line 6 MM4 Modulations Modeler ( with a few phaser patches ) , so I can compare these three units.The Phase 90 has a single `` Speed '' control that sets the rate of the phase , so it is simple to use . If there is a single knob , that is a good indicator that the manufacturer feels pretty good about the sound of the unit . In this case , I agree.The MXR Phase 90 is by far the cheapest of these three units . In my opinion , it also gives the best sound within its capabilities , and actually seems to boost the volume slightly . The Boss PH-3 gets a slight volume drop but it is workable , and the Line 6 MM4 has a volume drop that for me is hard to use on a guitar pedalboard because I usually do n't leave modulations on for an entire song , but turn them on/off in different sections ( unless its a chorus ) .Of the three , the Phase 90 has the least versatility . You can imitate the Phase 90 sound on both of the other units ( the Line 6 MM4 does a slightly better job ) and both the PH-3 and MM4 have more sonic possibilities . Also , the Boss PH-3 will give a lot more spacey extremes than the Phase 90 which stays in a `` normal '' range . But again , of the three the MXR Phase 90 sounds the best of the three at what it can do.Bottom Line : ( 1 ) A classic pedal at a great price ( 2 ) Great sound & slight volume boost ( 3 ) Simple to use ( 4 ) Limited sonic possibility , `` safe '' or `` normal '' guitar sounds ( no crazy extremes ) ( 5 ) Beautiful bright orange color , you ca n't miss it ( 6 ) Compact size does not eat up pedalboard space	1
Works amazingly well , is very precise , and easy to handle . I have seen other devices that would get confused about frequencies and jump back and forth between different notes . Not so this one . It is a great , reliable tuner .	1
I 've been playing guitar for over 30 years both teaching & performing and never used a pedalboard . I used to carry the FX 's in a briefcase and setup the ones I needed . I 'm old school when it comes to these boxes ... I run compression , wah , overdrive , super-overdrive , delay & reverb pretty much in that order . Sometime I use a phaser or a tremolo ... I also have a few distortion pedals laying around as well but do n't use them much . I currently have 8 pedals setup on this board . I have room for one maybe two more . The board itself is built like a tank and travels well . The bag that comes with it is road worthy for local gigs but I would n't take it on tour without a metal case . I did go ahead and Velcro down all the pedals that I always use leaving a little room for add ins . Be sure you want to Velcro down the FX chain because to get the best , most secure , it wo n't fall off the board when you pick it up off the floor ... I found that I had to remove all the rubber feet from each pedal . The Velcro is very strong and may test the durability of some of your cheaper pedals . Use great care when removing them from the board as you can easily rip the backs off of some of them . Low end wah pedals and boxes made out of plastic be warned ... .Boss , MXR , Mod Tone and other high end , well made pedals work best once set on the board . You can run any number of power sources to it . There is plenty of room for all my needed connections ... I leave the choice of that to you the reader.At the end of the day it 's easier for me to move my FX pedals around and setup on the gig is in minutes . Plus it looks much cleaner and gives me a little more room on tiny stages and less chance of tripping over a cable.. I 'm very happy with this product and would replace it should anything happen to it .	1
I gave this product 5 stars , simply because it did exactly what I bought it to do - reduce unwanted noise to my amp . You will have to play with the controls to get the exact settings where its not clipping your sustained notes off before you want it to . It does n't cut noise while your playing , but when your not it comes on a kills the noise . There are two lights on the pedal , one for the on and off and the other comes on when the pedal is working and reducing noise . If you have it set to high or to sensitive , it will not recognize the end of your sustained note and noise . So play with it and find your personal setting because I 'm sure every guitar and pedal board are unique in the sounds that start with your guitar and go through your pedal chain and out your amp . The NR300 works and as soon as you understand how it will do the best job for you , you will be happy with it . Oh , and if you switch it to Mute , it works as an on and off switch.. You also can not beat the price -- --	1
Schaller strap locks keep your guitar in place . They have been around a long time and hold up well with time . I also have used dunlops , which are nice as well , but these seem to be the better product IMHO .	1
it ok , its hard to use the bottom 1u space because of the angle , the gear must be very short to fit the bottom space before hitting your mounting surface ... .11u rack , not 12u ... .	1
Very comfortable . The soft yet thick leather ends will really protect the finish . Heavy duty but soft on the shoulder . Not cheap quality at all . This will definitely last a long time .	1
does really good with a fairly heavy microphone , adjustments stay in place without constantly tightening , works exactly as it should	1
This is the best deal ever my first pedal was a zoom 505 gfx and it was really electronic and synthesized sounding alot of echos and stuff . Honestly the best effect it held was the phaser/jet pipe effect . I got this today and man it sounds so crisp clean and evenly distorted . It does the job distortion and sustain best buy for a best price ! ! bodow ! ! ! from Trinidad ! !	1
It 's D'addario , you ca n't go wrongGreat quality and I am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand . Thanks	1
This was an impulse buy . After playing the guitar for many years I thought a ukulele would be a fun addition , and I was right . This one proved that you do n't have to spend big bucks for a nice instrument . It has a great sound , appears to be good quality and well made , all for a very reasonable price . At first it did n't seem to stay in tune for more than a day , I decided that it was likely due to new strings as it seemed to improve after a few months . If your a beginner and am looking for good quality without spending a lot , this is a nice instrument .	1
I love these picks . They last a long , long time and are surprisingly easy to grip . Currently my go to picks	1
Came on time . Work great for my needs . Geart for set-ups and take-downs . Does lengthen the strap a bit but works .	1
I like Ernie Ball strings . They are less expensive and seem to retain their integrity longer than the other brands I tried . I change strings every two weeks . I tried the rest and returned to the best .	1
I needed a few extra cables this year for a few live sound events . For the price point I was worried about buying `` cheap cables '' . This are a great value for your buck . The only thing I did n't like about these ... the cable ties suck ! haha ... If you need some quality `` cheap '' cable , these are for you !	1
I got this for my daughter , a begining guitarist , she has been playng for 3-4 months . She absolutely loves it . The product works perfectly and is durable . The downsides are it 's a bit awkward to turn , but easy to get used to . It is very hard to accurately cut the strings .	1
They have a nice thick sound , bright enough to be clear , good mids , nice bass notes , clear trebles . I like em .	1
I was n't expecting much from this pedal but it has been a pleasant surprise . I use it to zero in the tone of my Alvarez acoustic for live shows . The pedal is quiet and solidly built . The price is great too .	1
This is what these things should cost and this is how they should work . I will be trying this out in a chain of effects ( as the single power supply ) so I will report back if it can not do that . Works as expected for 1 to 1 pedal power . Enough said .	1
It arrived in a small package with 3 main pieces in it ( the base , the bottom fork and the top fork ) and it did n't take much assembly to put it together . It does a great job holding the guitar upright and makes it look a lot nicer as well . I will probably buy a couple more of these.The only downside I can see so far is that the foam padding is rather thin . I hope this does n't eventually have a hole wear through it , but over time I could see it happening . I suppose by that time I could find some replacement foam and fix it myself though .	1
These are good picks and produce a great tone . They 're better than most picks at sticking to my sweaty fingers .	1
Does what it 's supposed to do . Very sturdy feeling . Pretty sure I could strangle a person with it if I had to . I 'm not a dangerous person but you know , when people request wagon-wheel ... ... .	1
Really a nice upgrade ... especially for the price . They did stick up higher than the plastic pins , but I had read that they would . At least I know that they fit snug . Really look good !	1
This is a great invention . I have five different guitar effects pedals and a loop station all attached to this . It really saves on batteries and extension chords . It is well worth the money .	1
I tried this but ended up going back to Tortex . I like the satin finish on the Tortex better and the way it bends . The Ultex has a little brighter attack though and wears out less quickly . Ultex sounds more like the Fender celluloid .	1
For the money , I doubt you can beat these microphones . I just needed something for occasional outdoor shows and did n't want to spend a ton of money . So far , so good . I will say that the first shipment had a bad mic , but Amazon replaced it for free and paid for re-shipping , so I am happy about that .	1
Nice cables for the price . Nice to have a good name on them , and very useful for my band 's mixer rack setup .	1
To be honest , I was looking for a pedal that would give me distortion similar to Megadeth 's first album KIMB . So far I havnt got a perfect setup on it yet , but ive got close enough to it . This pedal is great , only a couple notes I should make about it . Do NOT buy this pedal if your expecting to play classic rock , or just rock in general . This pedal is for metal . The battery drains like a MF . I dont understand why . The only possible explanation I can think is that I leave it plugged into guitar and amp , but ive had other pedals that wouldnt drain the battery unless its TURNED ON . I prefer just to get an AC adapter and not use batteries . Other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal .	1
I use these cables to go from the balanced outputs of my digital piano ( I have a pro model with XLR outs ) to the inputs of studio monitors or audio interfaces . Works every time . Balanced signal is so much better ... no more issues with ground loops or other problems . Just clear as a bell.They were cheap and the build quality is fine .	1
I love these string swings ! My guitars are now out of their cases and up for display . I have 3 in my home : 2 for guitars and 1 for a ukulele ... and I 'm planning on buying 25 of them for my school ukulele program . They look great up on the wall .	1
I 've never had one of these pots fail on me . Never had one go scratchy . I 'm sure they will , as most pots will , but I 've either been fortunate or these are very well made pots .	1
I know that you can easily change strings without paying for a tool to help you out , but honestly this thing is worth every penny . It cuts your changing time down drastically . You do n't really know how convenient it is to have the peg puller , winder , and wire cutter all in a little tool until you actually have them all in a little tool . Not to mention , it 's very rigid and it certainly seems like it 'll hold up for years to come !	1
I borrowed a friends MXR to try and liked the added sounds it gave me . It filled a hole that was missing . since 80 % of my board is Behringer pedals I looked at Behringer first and was delighted when I found the PH9 Classic 90 . Side by side with the MXR , there was n't a hole lot of difference and with the Behringer 's added swirl switch , gives you a few more options . It also is made of metal for all of you that constantly criticize Behringer for their use of plastic in there other pedals . ( I 've read a ton of reviews and still have n't heard of one breaking because of the plastic ) As far as value to money spent , This pedal is again at the top of the list . Oh ! It also sounds great ! ! ! ! !	1
The only complaint I have about this is that there 's no clip on the back to hang it from so as to keep from knocking it over . This probably does n't matter to all of y'all though . Other than that , it 's a very nice machine with a flashing light and two & # 34 ; click & # 34 ; options . Easy to use and quality built . ~Pegleg~	1
I really did not expect much from this rag . I just wanted a good quality lint-free / scratch-free cloth to clean my stringed instruments before and after each use . I was totally surprised that it actually works this good . Removes all the crap on your shiny finish without having to spend time constantly cleaning with guitar cleaner . This will probably help protect your finish over the long run too.You may wonder how you can get excited just over a cheap little cleaning rag . This thing rocks ! It picks up every smudge , smear , & print and leaves nothing behind . It 's an amazing little cleaning tool , and I WILL replace it if/when it ever wears out . If you are like me , and you want your instruments to look clean & grunge-free onstage , you should check out this little wonder . You can just keep it in your pocket and wipe it once between songs if you want . Does n't get any easier . Great product ! **********************A note about the mixed reviews . I REALLY wish Amazon would separate the 3 different cloths instead of lumping them into one product page . It really is n't fair to the actual good product to have it 's rating artificially lowered by bad reviews for a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ITEM . It also causes confusion to potential buyers because they have to sift through every review to find the ones that apply to the actual product they want . When I go to the product page for the AMAZINGLY GOOD micro-fiber cloth and see horrible reviews about fraying and lint , it makes me sad . I have had both of the other items , and this micro-fiber cloth is NOTHING like the other 2 . This item has sewn/seamed edges that will not fray . It NEVER leave lint behind and it removes fingerprints & smudges and leaves only a nice clean instrument behind . No scratches , no lint , no hint it was ever there . My guitar always looks brand new after using this cloth , and I use the thing almost every day.I got on this rant bc I came here to replace mine after giving it away to a friend who fell in love with it . I told him I would just get another . Then I came here and could n't remember which version I bought , and the negative reviews seemed to be talking about a completely different item ( leaves behind lint ? ? What the crap are they talking about ? ) ... turns out they are talking about a completely different item . I looked up my purchase history and found I had bought the Micro-fiber , then I placed an order for 2 more ( 1 for me , 1 to give away , again ) .Putting a single item type on a page and having selectors for size or color is fine of course . Putting an apple and a lemon on the same page ( literally ) and lumping bad reviews for a horrible product in with great reviews for a wonderful product is just an error that needs to be fixed . At least now if you managed to find this lone clarifying review hidden among the dozens of other mismatched ones , you know what version to buy and which to avoid.Anyway , /End rant .	1
You cannnot go wrong with Elixir accoustic guitar strings . Taste in strings is difficult to discuss as what appeals to one may not appeal to another . However , you can not go wrong with those strings . I highly recommend them . I like their mellow sound which will last longer than other strings I have tried .	1
There is no shortage of `` Tubescreamer clones '' on the market for guitarists in search of that warm overdriven tube sound perfect for blues , jazz , and rock . The DigiTech Bad Monkey is one such example . But the Chinese-made Joyo JF-01 Vintage Distortion just be the best , and it 's half the price of a TS-9.About the manufacturer - Joyo hit the market a couple of years back and has now released about a couple dozen pedals that utilize their own form factor ( very similar to an MXR in size and switch ) but `` cloning '' the circuitry of well-known classic and modern boutique effects pedals . Some people jump to conclusions about Chinese products , but do n't just take it from me - do your homework . The response to these pedals has been overwhelmingly positive , and there are great vendors/distributors within the U.S. that test them out and can ship them to you within a few days . I 'm definitely a fan of Joyo products.As for the `` Vintage Distortion '' itself , people have said it 's based on either a TS-9 or the ( more expensive ) TS-808 . Frankly , while the latter is apparently warmer ( and less mid-range heavy ) than the former , I 'm not sure there 's any significant difference . I played this JF-01 side by side with my TS-9 , and it 's probably one of the more exact `` clones '' in the Joyo lineup . For example , the Joyo `` Ultimate Drive '' is an excellent ( higher-gain ) overdrive pedal based on a Fulltone OCD , but you can still notice differences in the resulting sound and settings required to get there ( some of which are arguably BETTER than the original ) . With the settings matched , the JF-01 performed almost exactly like the TS-9 in level , gain , and tone . There probably is little more gain available on this pedal with that knob cranked full , which is n't a bad thing . It 's very responsive to your playing style and , again , it sounds like a Tubescreamer.I 'll probably be keeping my Tubescreamer , if only because it 's an iconic pedal that performs well . But it 's superior in name only - if I had to use the Joyo Vintage Overdrive in its place , I 'd be no worse for the wear . 5 stars , highly recommended !	1
Well I did n't expect much due to the price ... But trust me this thing is really good ... I 've tried EH nano grail . I own the holier grail . I 've heard the boss verbs . And I really like this one . Save your money this pedal is good enough ... I 'll make a video and post it soon ...	1
Addario strings are ok.. Although like beauty it is in the eyes of the beholder ... Aquila seems to be the most popular now . I have used both and I am satisfied with both ... I play the soprano , concert , tenor , and baritone . Each one different in it on right ... Also play the the concert scale banjolele.. Only been playing the uke for 5 years and the banjo for 10 so it is only IMHO . Be aware though that 10 years experience can mean 1 year experience 10 times : ) ) ) )	1
I put these on a Parker . Great that they have uniform tension . Took a bit to get used to , but they are very playable . vlues , rock , country . Nice strings .	1
This thing is dead on the money when it comes to tuning . It has many features I have yet to utilize , but good to know they are there if needed .	1
This shelf is so convenient and so often used that you would think that it should come on every music stand . It just slips on to the lower shelf and creates a smaller shelf for pencils , pens , clip on tuners , capos , etc . It pays dividens in not cluttering up your book shelf so that items go spilling to the floor every time you adjust a book or turn a page . I love how a pen , capo , or tuner clipped to the top lip of the shelf serve to keep pages firmly in place until your book is & # 34 ; trained & # 34 ; to stay in place . A must have , five star item .	1
use the cloth often to polish my guitar . The fender logo makes it look legit . Recommended to one and all .	1
Practical , useful for drum kit . Tilts to match personal requirement . Fits easily onto cymbal stand and , importantly , holds in place during performances . Prof Mike Haller	1
Well , to date , these Snark tuners have got to be one of the best tuners I 've ever run across.I highly recommend them , especially the ones with the built-in vibration sensor .	1
I 've never really owned a fuzz pedal before , but have tried a few . Out of most I 've tried , I 've come across the Big Muff the most . It did n't really strike me as a good flavor of distortion to have until recently . Even my Boss Hyper Metal HM-3 is considered by some to be a fuzz pedal by some folks , but it is n't 100 % there , certainly.My budget being what is it right now , I did n't want to spend a lot for a fuzz pedal . There are loads of fuzzes available for $ 100 or less , but this model is essentially three pedals in one . That 's what attracted me to it , along with a few reviews in YouTube . Not to mention the bargain basement price.The three modes can be accessed via a switch on the right side of this pedal . The two fuzz modes ( in my view ) do n't perfectly emulate any one pedal , but are extremely useful nonetheless.FUZZ 1 is a creamy , midrange filled sound . It does n't get too bright , until the TREBLE knob is pushed past 3 o ' clock . This fuzz could make even anemic single coils sound rich and thick . With humbuckers , it 's actually quite clean in silences until the gain is past about 2 o ' clock . I love the way this fuzz sputters when notes and chords decay . It seems to work best with power chords ( root-5th note ) , and single notes . If you play complex chords , you 'll hardly notice them ; if you try to play them , use as little gain as possible.FUZZ 2 is more in line with the Big Muff . It has a scooped midrange , which makes things sound dark and sinister . With the increased bass and treble , complex chords work slightly better here . This fuzz also has more sustain than FUZZ 1 , so it buzzes longer . This makes it great to use alongside a guitarist that 's using a looser sounding high gain tone that is n't necessarily fuzzy . ( Head era KoRn comes to mind for me ... ) The third option is ultimately what made my purchase worthwhile . BOOST . This mode is a clean boost with a flat midrange level . It actually distorts a little , but that 's only after cranking the EQ and GAIN knobs all the way up . The resulting buzz does sound a bit like a slightly overdriven non-master volume amp ( or a master volume 's clean channel fully cranked ) . Still , throughout most of its gain and volume range , BOOST does a good job of staying clean . This would be great for pushing an amp into overdrive , or extending the gain of a heavily distorted sound . It might also be useful for a tiny volume boost for cleaner guitar tones , or just to maintain a stronger signal for a path full of effects.Overall , I like the tones this pedal spits out . I 've only had it a few hours , but I love what I 'm hearing so far . The build is similar to the other Behringer pedals I have , a NR100 noise reducer , and a TO800 , their overdrive that sounds like a Tube Screamer . With this more recent pedal ( built on June of 2010 ) , the knobs seem slightly sturdier than before . I 'd still not abuse them too much , though . As always , really abusive stompers might want to look elsewhere ( or find a way to put the guts inside a custom built tank ) .You ca n't go wrong with the bright blue LED , either ! Makes it easy to see on a dark stage , along with the dayglo orange pedal color .	1
it sticks on forever and holds lots of picks . It does exactly what it says it does . its also very cheap .	1
My picks fall out way too easy while i 'm playing live	-1
Not really bright enough . Both bright and lower light levels are exactly the same . I would look for something else if I did n't already have this . OK for reading a small book in bed , but does n't cover the sheet music brightly enough .	-1
In my experience these cables were not great . The connectors rattle , they are made of cheap materials and the cable subsequently had a ton of line noise . I ca n't expect miracles at that price-point but I certainly expected better . I avoid this brand of cables .	-1
The fact that it is passive really kills it . I just could not get any sound out of it , I tried multiple placements . I finally just bought a guitar with a pickup in it . Not worth the money , or the extra hole in your guitar .	-1
Arrive , in trashed packing , but the worst was that it sounded like a piece of chalk on a blackboard ... certainly NOT professional quality or any quality that I would give it .	-1
Okay , Color coding is a GREAT idea.Divas will not use the red ball windscreen.Why ? Because , from a distance it looks like they have a clown nose.No kidding ! I have had several tell this to me and my sound tech . So save your dough , buy any color but RED.Diva 's ! ! ! ! What can I say ?	-1
I bought this to use with my keyboard . I was n't really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals . It does n't work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano , which is what I 'd always used . Does n't have the same feel either . Nowhere close.In my opinion , a sustain pedal like the M-Audio SP-2 Sustain Pedal with Piano Style Action or other similar pedal is a much better choice . The price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better . The only thing I 've found the Yamaha FC-5 Sustain Pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where I keep my electric guitar pedals .	-1
The TASCAM TH-2000 headphones are like putting a pair of studio monitors on your ears ! They are great ! Excellent bass response ( not muddy at all ) , tight mids , and clear highs . To boot , they are extremely comfortable as well . The foam fits nicely around your ears , conforming to the contours of your face . They are adjustable , so if you have a huge head you can still wear these . The only drawback that I can see , and I do n't really even consider this a negative , is the coiled cord . Some people may not like that . All in all these are great headphones - I have listened to all varieties of music with them , monitored recordings with them , etc ... excellent ! By the way , they also are pretty good at cancelling extraneous noise in the background , making the music come out clearer . Kudos to Tascam for making such good headphones ! May 12 , 2014 UPDATE -- -- -- These headphones quit working after just a few months of working properly . I have a couple pair of inexpensive behringers that have lasted through more abuse and are still working . What a disappointment ! ! !	-1
I 'm another reviewer who has , upon personal inspection , discovered that the rear leg of the stand is too short to provide staedy support for any beloved guitar . I returned it.I 've & # 34 ; First Act & # 34 ; brand stands similar in appearance but more intelligently constructed .	-1
Amazon and TC Electronics will not tell you that you need a 9V Power Supply . I did n't see any warning or advise in the Point of Purchase , nor in the package . This is an unfair practice from Amazon and TC Electronics .	-1
I bought an Ibanez Concert size uke . The body is 2 inches wide ( less than the 2.75 inches stated for this stand ) . My uke does not fit well in the stand . Why ? The twin forks at the base that hold the instrument are both too narrow , and the curve downward from the stand is not proper for this uke . Thus , any uke that is concert size or greater . So , most ukes do n't fit well . They fit , just not well.I did , and you will likely need this advice , remove the bottom fork , turn it upside down , and reinstall it ( no tools required ) . Now the `` curve '' of it is upward , and the uke better sits on it . The fit is improved . Not great but better . One stand ca n't fit all instruments , but my full size guitar stands hold most all guitars . This small stand does not hold most all ukes.Although its neat how it folds up , like the video here on Amazon reviews , it is very heavy for its size . This is not a lightweight stand . At all . Surprisingly heavy , and not one that you will be lugging around day to day in your uke gig bag , trust me.I wish I got the Hercules standHercules GS402B Mini Stand . All Hercules stuff is superb , and my friend has one for his uke and says it 's sublime ( I do n't own it , myself , so I just present this so you can research it and it 's reviews on Amazon ) . I own other Herc stuff , and it 's all ideal , and for a few bucks more , I could have had that lifelong-use stand instead of this one . Oh , well , for once , I got cheap . And got burned for it.All in all , not great , this tiny stand . One stand fits NOT all . Perhaps a violin or something would be better on this stand , but I think the general shape of it is less than ideal for most instruments . You may think you can bend the lower forks , but it 's hard to do , will require a vice , and if you see on the Amazon pictures , the lower fork just sits in two plastic grooves , so if you splay it out like it should be , you 'll change the way it fits in the grooves , and thus it won ; t work at all . It 's just an imperfect design . My take on it , your mileage may vary . Bye bye .	-1
This is an update to my original review because I have now fully tested two of these capos . I 'm truly surprised by all the good reviews here . I 'm not sure how it 's possible . I 've already outlined below in my original review that these are not Jim Dunlop capos . I had purchased two , which I have now given away to student players as I can not use them . I tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar . The E string buzzes when the capo is applied and no amount of adjusting the capo would stop the buzz from occurring . Both capos had this very same problem.When I received these capos , I noticed right away that they were not the same excellent quality as actual Jim Dunlop capos . The craftsmanship was visibly lower quality and the materials used are a lesser quality than official Jim Dunlop capos . The rubber has a strong odor and there is no brand-name printed anywhere on the product . As a professional musician , I need to purchase reputable brand-name products because I ca n't afford to have my gear failing during performances . I have no idea about the future performance of these capos because they have no apparent brand , and no measurable reputation . When I contacted the seller , they were not honest with me .	-1
I purchased this as my first guitar slide . I loved it for about one month , then it fell off my finger and shattered into tiny pieces . I almost cut myself ! I will never buy a glass slide again , I recently bought a Dunlop brass slide and love it . The difference between glass and metal is that glass is a muddier , mellow tone , and glass is crisper , louder , and does not break . I would not suggest this to anyone . The metal ones are about the same price , they do n't break , and sound way better . There 's a reason ALL pros use metal ! The review below is wrong . Slides are meant to cover your ENTIrE finger , all the way to the tip . You do n't bend your finger to play slide . You retune your guitar to an open tuning . Just thought I would point that out .	-1
Works as advertised but the keys are stiff . Pads take too much presure to activate . Nice that I dont need another interface to connect it to my laptop.After the first few uses the USB socket broke and fell off into the unit rendering it useless . Wrote to dealer that was listed as selling it to me thru Amazon only to have them tell me the wrong seller was listed . I had registered it with AKAI already so I complained to them and they sent me a new one . I had to pay shipping back the old one to them even though it was a defective product.Not recommending this product .	-1
I bought this because -- hey , a wireless mic for $ 13 ? Why not ? I *might* be able to use this in a public address system -- the connections all work , and it makes sounds , but the static is unbearable no matter how much I fiddle with different , the adjustment screw in the receiver ... nothing works . The audio is always clipped . Do n't even think of using this for music .	-1
I bought this pedal as a companion to my Roland AC-33 Acoustic Amp . The pedal on its face looks like a good piece of equipment and feels quite sturdy . However you do have to use a 9 volt batter to make it operate . This is totally unnecessary for a foot-switch . The worst part is the leads on the battery connector ( 9 volt ) were not properly soldered or had shorted out . The only way I could get it to function was to let the 9volt battery dangle just right and connection would be made . For the rather high asking price and the limited function that is needed ( i.e . all that has to work are two switches and a battery ) you would think that Boss would put out a better product . I also found that the battery cover was extremely cheap and was difficult to close , leading me to believe that the durability of the cover was in question . I would HIGHLY recommend that you look to another maker for a switch or consider constructing one yourself with readily available parts that can be purchased on this site .	-1
bought for my son to do game capture voice overs . the first day it was fine , if a bit sensitive , by the third day it was broken . cheap to buy , but cheaply made .	-1
Based upon some of the other reviews , I feel I got a different product , as it did n't fit the descriptions given by others . I ordered two of these , and both were very thin material , not sturdy at all . Second , both straps were not adjustable to 59 & # 34 ; . Both mine measured 45 & # 34 ; from strap button hole to strap button hole , fully-extended . They are useless to me , as my guitar , a dreadnought , covers the middle of my chest when I put it on . I believe I was given a substitute product , since when I ordered these straps , the price was just $ 1.00 , and now they 're back up to $ 4.95 as I write this . I 'm really sick of these Amazon substitutions . For what I paid , I wo n't bother returning them ... not worth the hassle . I will donate them to a local music teacher who has students with smaller guitars . Very disappointed . Warning ... if you see a price drop below $ 4.95 , do n't buy ... it 's probably not the product that 's described here .	-1
I bought this capo thinking it would look slicker without the clamp handles sticking out but what I found is that although it looks cool , it 's complicated ( which for a capo is saying something ) . The release lever makes it difficult to get a good amount of pressure on the strings and nearly impossible to put it at the top of the guitar when not in use.Bottom line : If you do n't mind the extra effort and do n't plan on keeping it on your guitar when not using , then maybe you will enjoy it . For everyone else , look elsewhere .	-1
I ordered this product to use for personal recording , and thought ... what could possibly go wrong ? I ordered it `` New , '' and it definitely shows signs that it not new . First , the package was stapled , that 's right- STAPLED together in a way in which you could tell the product had been opened . Then , to make matters worse , there is a hole in one side of the fabric . When I order something new , I expect it to be new . Based on this product alone , I would not recommend buying from this seller .	-1
another item never received but i would not use anything over .88 mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase .	-1
Behringer pedals are really cheaply made and the feel amazingly light , cheap and unable to take the riggors of gigging . I just did n't want to spend $ 100 on the Boss version , but you get what you pay for ! Another thing that I hate is it 's really hard to change the battery , unlike the Boss pedals . save your money and steer clear of this one . I also bought a Behringer power amp for $ 200 that lasted a few gigs befor it crapped out .	-1
It did not perform . Looks cool , but thats it . Very large and inconvenient . Would not recommend this because I would not recommend the blue yeti .	-1
I thought it was my jack for a while , then I noticed it would n't stay in any pedal . There is no `` click '' assuring that the cable is in place ... and there 's a reason for that , it is n't ! Slips right out of every pedal I have . Not reliable .	-1
Nice looking gooseneck , threads are clean , fits well . However , the gooseneck is too flexible and will not hold up a mic ( Shure SM58 ) without collapsing . Better try another brand , or spend a buck or two more to get a better product .	-1
Unless you tune to only standard tunings this thing is garbage ! I tune my hellraiser to d then drop to c and it will not register . the needle either flops around constantly or just does not display the proper notes .	-1
I even called Dunlop to see if these lok strap systems would work for an electric acoustic . The guy at Dunlop told me `` oh yes , they have been specifically designed to work with electric acoustic '' . That is NOT the case . I purchased multiple units , and it will cost me more to return to Amazon than it 's worth . But basically I know have hunks of plastic that I could use to make a sculpture ! Because of the bottom pin being the plug in for electric pick up , the thickness causes a problem and this plastic do hickey will not fit.If anyone out there has a solution for securing the strap , please reply to this feedback.What really frosts me is that I called Dunlop and apparently their customer service folks do n't know their products well enough to be recommending product . It 's called , TRAIN your people ! ! !	-1
So heres the thing that no one else wants to say . The thing is built like a piece of s*** . It jingles and rattles and parts are always moving around . I used this 3 times and it shorted out . The lights started flashing and it got hot . I called line 6 and they determined it was bad so they opened a `` ticket '' . FYI if you want to deal with the worst customer service in the industry just call line 6 . Not only do they not know what they were talking about but in the backgrounc I could hear them lauging and joking like there was a big party going on . I wish I would have never bought this but hopefully I get a new one soon . Well see how helpful they really are .	-1
I purchased Elixir strings after hearing them repeatedly recommended at the music store . Put them on my Eko Ranger XII acoustic 12 string . Have 2 problems with the strings . First , the bass E ( 11th string ) broke while tuning it up . Had to go to music store and buy a single replacement string ( not Elixir ) . I have changed strings many , many times , so I am convinced it was not my stringing , but a weakness in the E string itself . Second , the high D ( 8th string ) seems `` dead '' ; it does not `` ring '' as it should and as the other high strings do ( though none as much as other 12 string sets I 've used ) . Considering these strings cost much more than others , I certainly am disappointed in them . Hardly matters if they last longer if they do n't sound as good .	-1
This is a pretty decent thing for practicing your guitar through your iPhone or iPad . But if you want to use it for any recording at all , even demos , I strongly recommend going for the iRigHD . The HD sounds waaaaaay better , and the build quality is great . This guy , not so much . There was always a bit of noise with my old iRig , and it seemed to get worse over time . It also felt kinda fragile and chinsy . If you look , you can usually find the HD somewhere for $ 80 ; a $ 50 difference is significant , but the jump in quality ( and likely longevity of the product ) is definitely worth it . I upgraded and would absolutely do it again .	-1
Well ... its a stand.. its super cheap and i do n't mean the price . the edges are sharp and the piece that holds the neck of the guitars is leaning too far back.. i stuck some cardboard under the rear post to help keep that back brace more up right and no leaning back . its going to work but i bumped the bottom with my bare feet and it cut me pretty well . Instructions were ok.. came with more parts than what were required ... all holes filled and i have of of each part extra.. the guitars do not sit very well in this stand ... i will use it until i can find a better one.. it will get replaced.. i really should send this POS back to Amazon . the concept is great but the execution of it sucks . it folds down but not sure i would use this as a portable stand.. there are better options out there for something portable . this stand is worth 10.00 tops ... if i had it to do all over i would save my money .	-1
The only instrument this works well on is my Yamaha guitarelele which has nylon strings , for steel strings I want more pressure , I advise getting the NS Capo that is not `` lite '' , I prefer that one above this model .	-1
I tried this in front , in the middle , and at the end of an effects chain , as well as by itself , plugged into the effects loop of my Mesa Boogie Mark V amplifier . Whenever it is in the path , as soon as I engage my effects loop , the signal level drops considerably . It did not matter whether the pedal was on or not . The chorus effect is good , but I do n't want my volume to drop every time I turn on my effects loop . I have the loop balanced with all of the other pedals that I use , so I ca n't raise the send any more .	-1
the cable hisses , crackles and pops right out of the package . save your money and buy a better cable . i will buy cables locally from now on so i can easily return them if they are defective . i would definitely not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone else .	-1
They say 2-4 months , I 've never come close to even a month . Usually 3 weeks and they are toast in a guitar case not opened more than twice in that 3 weeks . If it sounds too good to be true , it usually is . I do n't recommend these .	-1
Be careful ; I have a small recording studio , so we put our cables through a lot , and these guys just do n't last . They were fine for the first few months , but then they started to die like a murder mystery . Seriously , one after another they would just go , for no apparent reason.Fine one second , and then it would just go horribly staticky . I actually had two blow at one time , and thought my PA was shot . Thankfully , it was just these cables . NOT GOOD . Spend a little extra on another brand . These have been my favorite : GLS Audio 25ft Cable Cords	-1
I purchased 2 of these items to use with my band for the guitarists . I was disapointed when I mounted a Shure sm 58 mic on it and found that the goose neck would not stay erect . These are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics . They may work on very small and light weight units but for my needs they are totally unuseable . It would have been helpful to include the suggested weight that this goose neck would support in the sales description . I wasted my money . Do n't waste yours . Perhaps viagra would be helpful ; - )	-1
If you 're a metalhead , STAY AWAY ! ! I tried this on multiple metal pedals and the peavey Rogue G10 blows it out of the water . This thing sounds like CRAP with anything distortion . It 's GREAT for jazzy blues and an ultra clean tone though or that classic fender crunch . But if you demand metal , get far away !	-1
Far too slippery for my fingers when I shredding and the tip wears out way too fast as well .	-1
As the title states , this is a lightly padded duffle bag , nothing more . If you 're toating between practice with an instructor , it 's okay . I purchased it for that reason ... and I 'm an adult , so I can be careful . This bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage . I would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag . It will prevent my guitar from scuffs , dings , dent & dirt , but that 's it.There are better gig bags at a comprable price and the only reason I gave it two stars was becuase of the dirt cheap price .	-1
Unhappy with it , actually I already replaced them . The method of attachment is poorly designed , it does n't matter how tight you screw the two sections of the lock with the catch balls , the thread slips and my guitar almost fell down to the ground in a couple of occasions . Expensive locks too .	-1
Our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago . Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body . I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass ... not good . My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend.The problem with the design is there 's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that 's screwed into the body unscrewing itself . We 've tried applying bar soap , petro jelly , and a spray can based dry lubricant ... . none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.We are switching to the Dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero 'unscrewing ' force.We tried to make the Fender/Shallers work but just could not . Maybe we 're all too active on stage but we can not tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us .	-1
The travel would be tolerable for a sitting position ... , but I stand in front of a mic on stage . The pedal generates a lot of & # 34 ; noise & # 34 ; so I ca n't use it . You get what you pay for . King Vox and Dunlop High Gain , both passive , have passed the test , and I 'm pretty picky !	-1
I have three mic stands , with this one being the fourth . I STILL have three mic stands because this one was absolutely horrible.1 . The top mount would rarely stay fixed and kept dipping down.2 . The bottom clamp never did secure properly . It kept opening up even without a mic on it . The weight of the stand itself stripped it.I sent it back without hesitation .	-1
soi f you want to turn Distor t off , u can not .dig ? it s always on ... alwaysif you like hard rock that wayu need this tiny gig thingie	-1
Ok its cheap . You knew that when you bought it . I really thought it was going to be more then one since it said assorted and showed a few in the picture . It was only one and it was red . Broke with first use .	-1
Years ago I used the Clayton & # 34 ; small teardrop & # 34 ; picks . I could n't tell from the picture , that these were full size , and I did n't check the size in the description . I still had a few of the small ones , so I used them as templates , to cut these down . I would have rated them higher , if I could have used them as is . It 's my own fault for not looking at the specifications . I purchased two six packs of Clayton Teardrop picks , but found Dunlop 423R60 0.60mm ( Orange ) Tortex Small Tear Drop Guitar Picks , 36-Pack which are a lot cheaper .	-1
Purchased it to use on a 00-28 slotted headstock Martin and it just did n't fit well for me . Also found it extremely difficult to attach and remove . A string style worked a lot better , was a lot easier to attach and remove , and provided a lot more options for where it good be placed .	-1
Although this is a very solid feeling pedal and the output and sustain knobs worked , the attack knob ( the control for how much compression you want to apply ) did absolutely nothing . I even checked it in my recording software by looking at the waveforms and there was no change at all regardless of the attack setting.Perhaps my pedal was a rare defective one , but none-the-less I returned the pedal back to Amazon and will search for another compression solution for my pedal board .	-1
I bought this for my Canon Vixia HF G10 Video Camera and a Shotgun Mic that I recently purchased for it . I needed a 12 & # 34 ; wire for it to be a perfect fit from my mic ( which is mounted on the Mini Advanced Shoe ) to the microphone plug on the Video Camera ... The wire on this thing is *not* 1 foot long . the actual wire is under 8 & # 34 ; long itself . I would have returned this thing but it was cheap enough that it was n't worth the hassle ... I 'd have rated it 1 star , but I tried it on my Nikon D3200 ( Shoe mounted Shotgun Mike ) and it worked out ok . Still a tight fit though ( since there 's only 8 & # 34 ; of wire ) ... I 'd recommend anyone looking for a short cable go with a 2 ' adapter ; worst case scenario , you can zip-tie a loop instead of getting angry that it does n't fit.Also , not sure if it 's the wire ( so this did n't affect stars ) but I hear a hiss when recording . Again ; unsure if it 's the way the wires are stretched out to the max on the DSLR or not ( or my shotgun mic ) .	-1
A great idea , but pure crap in terms of functionality . if you do n't have something heavy on the flat end , the rubber piece moves , and before you know it , your axe is on the ground . I saw some pictures of putting a 12 ounce can on the flat part as a counterweight , but I 'm not so hot with that idea , especially if the can is open . The lip need to extend down longer , and *something* needs to be done on the bottom of the flat portion to stop this gadget from moving around . If I had a permanent place to mount this , I 'd gorilla glue it down , but that then defeats the beauty of this being mobile and I 'll get an extra guitar stand instead . Good idea , but it does n't work .	-1
I did n't expect this cable to be so thin . It 's easily 1/2 the thickness of any guitar cable I 've used . Not sure about long-term durability or signal loss/interference . If I had the foresight I 'd spend a couple extra bucks on a thicker cable . Still , it works and was inexpensive.EDIT : 6 months later and it 's dead already . Wire frayed at the right angle jack . You get what you pay for .	-1
I honestly do n't see the purpose . It does n't seem to have improved my experience with my strings on my guitar . I 've used it a few times , but do n't see the benefit.Edit 5/30/13 : After coming back to read the other reviews , it 's obvious what happened : This was shipped to me completely dry . There was no grease/lubricant qualities . It was like a dry erase pad . They need to improve their quality control . I 'm changing my rating from 3 star to 1 star . They HAVE to find a way to fully secure this gap or maybe consider enhanced vacuum sealing packaging.I would suggest if you receive this product and it has n't dried out yet , to place this product in a air-tight ziplock bag to reduce the likelihood of this drying out .	-1
This is a cheap piece of junk that does what it says , it distorts , You want something to make your guitar sound like junk , this will do it . Why pedals that make your guitar sound like a piece of junk are the most popular is beyond me . This is not a boutique Distortion pedal like Hendrix would use . Boutique and distortion are an oxymoron.These things are built with heavy metal , it should last , I kinda hope it does n't ( just kidding ) , you want distortion , you got distortion	-1
A dull , inept version of a TubeScreamer . Just sounds flat and boring . Not very inspiring . At all . ( Then again , I never did really like TS 's ) ... ... .	-1
The handle and spring strength make this uncomfortable to place on the guitar , and I feel rushed to clamp on the capo because it 's unpleasant to use - hurts the fingers . It 's cheap and easy to use . It 'll do the job , but I do n't like it .	-1
This is more of a toy than a good pickup . It functions but does n't sound great . What did I want for this price anyway ?	-1
Pretty disappointed in the color . As the review title indicates , what I received is more of a 'black chrome ' or dingy stainless color . These are simply not going to work with the MOTS pickguard I purchased them for . Perhaps they would blend in better on a black , black pearl or tort pickguard.I ordered another package from another vendor and got the same result . Perhaps it is a large factory shipment that is 'bad ' . Some are very dull looking . Very disappointing , really .	-1
I should have read the reviews carefully - it 's definitely something different , but not sturdy at all , rubber bits come off as you strum , and there are complaints of skid marks on strings and fingers . Ouch ! I 'm much happier with my Friday the 13th glow-in-the-dark picks - that is an experiment that worked ! And who cares about hard pick sounds anyway ? If you want something that sounds like your fingers strumming , why do n't you use & # 8230 ; your fingers ?	-1
Stopped working all by itself . Fresh battery did n't help.Fortunately , I 've another , plus a Korg and an two Intellitouch . ( I 've 2 fiddles and 3 guitars ) The Intellitouch is simply `` champion ! `` .	-1
For some reason , this one just does n't hit the notes right . It looks like it should tune more precise than other models but the tone is way off for mine anyway . I have tried it several times and it just does n't tune right . Then I recheck with my other brand and it 's not even close . Maybe I just got a bad one ? I like that this one shuts off automatically..but again , it 's WAY off tune.I did like the style , size and color ... ..but it does n't work right so it 's like running with a flat tire ...	-1
I have a Taylor 710ce and this strap had to be forced over the top connection near the neck of the guitar . Rather than ruin the finish of the guitar I just got a different strap . Plus the nylon slips very easy which is not a plus for me since I had to keep correcting the position of the guitar to where I liked it to play . If the nylon is not a problem for you and the ends fit over your guitar this strap is very well made .	-1
The small e-string and the g- string both broke on the ball end while tuning . I have n't broke a string while tuning in 20 years , never ever had one break on the ball end.Luckily I bought the three pack.But I ca n't recommend this product .	-1
This gadget works fine to connect an electric guitar to an iPad or iPhone or a computer , but the particular one I received has a defective input socket for a 1/4 inch audio plug . It does n't snap in place . Just sits there waiting to let the plug slide out . That makes it fairly useless . I may have simply gotten a defective one .	-1
If you only want to use this thing as a detune effect to add a static , non-oscillating , chorus like effect , it 's fine for that . As an actual pitch shifter though , this thing is awful . All the pitch shift settings sound like they 're 30 cents sharp . This is especially awful sounding when used as an Octave effect . I suppose I could have opened it up to see if there was an adjustment pot inside but I did not want to void the warranty so I just returned it . It 's hard to believe that nobody at the company could hear how badly out of tune this pedal is . I 've read the same complaint about their Pure Octave pedal also . This is really too bad because all the other pedals for Mooer seem to be quite good . I own their Reecho Delay pedal and quite like it and I 'm also tempted to get their Green Mile pedal.If you 're not that sensitive to pitch inaccuracies , this pedal maybe fine for you but I doubt that many will find this pedal to be satisfactory.One minor quibble about the rubber padding used at the bottom of these pedals . It does not stick to the adhesive on ANY of the Velcro strips I 've tried to use .	-1
It was Not what I wanted . When A Person has a low Income We can Not afford what We can Not use . I was looking for what Is called Shimmer most Reverbs do Not have Shimmer as the RV600 Because Digitech called Shimmer , String Swell and Volume Swell Is linked to the Violin Sound It cost Me 30.00 Its called Slow Motion for a reason because It has to be played slow to hear the effect the only way to hear It Is with Over Drive being played on the high Strings . It might be good for playing with a Bow , I have No Idea because I can Not afford a Bow .	-1
TC is very overrated.Many pedals I have out performs this in my opinion . The vintage BBDs ( MXR Vintage DElay , Morley 70 's echo ) for example just take it . But for newer pedals I liked the MXR Carbon Copy and Ibanex DE 7 much better .	-1
Good grip , but too flexible , and the description says nothing the thickness or the flexibility of these picks . Probably good for strumming , but not good for lead .	-1
It seems to do nothing as an effect and draws power reducing the volume on your instrument as well as the amp . Not sure if it is just a broken pedal or if it is just junk . When received the package did not appear to be damaged , but I have tried it on 3 different amps and i get the same results regardless of the amp or the instrument .	-1
I am a long-time musician with lots of experience with tuners and stringed instruments ... wanted to like this ... but ... First the positives : - Looks great- nice , easy to read display- the screen pivots in almost every direction to suit your needs- the clip seems sturdy- tuner is compact- nice priceNow the significant disappointment : - inaccurateThe settings were on A-440 but every time I tuned an acoustic instrument with this thing , the tuning was sharp ... I tested this not only by ear but against other tuners ... very disappointing ... I have used the old Planet Waves tuners for years and had settled on them as the best choice for the price ; however , since D'Addario now owns Planet Waves products , they have discontinued the tuner I like and only offer the NS Mini Tuner ( it has its place I guess , but I much prefer the larger one ... too bad they made this decision IMO ) ... I have n't settled on my new tuner of choice yet so for now I will keep using my old Planet Waves models ... Bottom line , no matter how nice the Snark is in many ways , the primary function is to help the musician tune accurately , not only string to string but to a standard A-440 ... having failed that requirement , it is useless for me , especially in a band situation ...	-1
I 've been very disappointed with this tuner . When I 've used it the needle keeps jumping all the way to the right ( sharp ) then back to the left ( flat ) . I have two ( 2 ) other tuners I bought from Wal-Mart and I always get accurate tunings from them . I bought this KORG because it 's a brand name and the Company has an outstanding reputation . Even though my tow ( 2 ) Wal-Mart tuners are older , they both still work better than this KORG .	-1
I do n't know who designed the leg feature of this thing , but they need to go back to engineering school . When you unlock the legs to put them into their useable position , they 're quite difficult to pop open , and once opened into place , you can see distinct spots where the paint has worn off , because the fit is too tight inside the upper body of the stand.It 'd truly be nice to come across a good stand like this that used button locks to hold the legs in place , and that had more of an upright angle for the guitar . I just do n't like the features of this stand at all .	-1
I have had 2 of these tuners ( you 'd think I 'd learn after one ) . They calibrate okay , it 's just that they tend to break where the swivel ball fits into the socket of the device ( both of mine broke this way ) . To me , for the price , it 's made cheaply . Try D'Addario instead ; love their tuners .	-1
I really wanted to like these , but they 're a frickin , lint-catching sticky frickin ' mess ! They went from my wife 's snare back into the holder in a New York Minute , have never seen the light of day , and may have been thrown in the garbage . Save your money . We use a heavy stoneware coaster with a cork back to quieten her snare now .	-1
I really wanted this to work , but it does n't . Do n't bother , it does n't mute the strings at all . One star , just for it getting here on time .	-1
My problem is that I am used to playing Hohner Golden Melody and Special 20 harps . I guess I should have paid attention to the other 1 and 2 star ratings . These harps have no volume . Do n't waste your money on them . I guess the only thing worth having is the case , but the case has no handles or carry strap.5/25/14 - I said the case had no handle , well I take that back . There is a little strap inside that prevents the case from opening flat . I was able to fold that little strap outwards and then zip the two zippers up to it . With one finger I can carry the case with my quality harps inside .	-1
Disappointing ; was looking for to receiving these.But ; mostly they are unplayable . Leak air badly . Easier learning bagpipes than these things.Save your money and get some harps that actually work.Decent case though .	-1
If you are looking for a 100 % leather mandolin strap , consider another strap . The outside surface of the Planet Waves strap is leather but the inside surface is some kind of man-made material glued to the thin leather part . I will be ordering the Levys `` Leather Mandolin Strap ( Walnut ) '' .	-1
The picks work well with bass , but they are just too thick to use with ukulele . The pics also shed easily , making your instrument dusty in no time .	-1
in the old days , we used tobe able to buyall 6 NYLON clear strings ... .now tis almost impossible ... .with these strings on even a cheap or semi decentclassic geeetar ... .one will prefer playing on the hi 3 treble strings ... very nice , resonant , and clean ... not shrillbutwhat is that garbage metallica with the other 3 supposed to bebass strings i dont know ... Again , like someone else NOTED the OBVIOUS > > > > > sound transition from the nylon to the wire wound nylon is GIGANTIC.This makes the move from the D to the G string too noticableCANT THEY EVEN MAKE 6 strings that sound similar for the same one guitar even ? makes it sound like 2 different geeetars totally ... sucks bad now.oohthanks man	-1
The technology is fine but the attachment to the instrument is n't very friendly . Snark rotates to any position I want , but Intellitouch ends up being upside down . It works fine but it 's inconvenient .	-1
In fact , I do n't think this Hosa GTR215R cord lasted 2 hours . One step on the cord and it came apart . This purchase is the very reason why I 'm looking to buy a wireless system . Maybe if you 're using this to run a PA I would recommend it . But if any performer is hard on their cords I would n't recommend this item ... .but to be fair , I would recommend wireless to any performer . You 'll end up saving money over the long haul .	-1
I purchased these picks , because I play bass in an alternate punk metal band . We play drop tuning and playing with a plastic or nylon pick creates alot of noise . I was hoping that these picks would stop the pick noise . They do n't make that annoying plastic to metal sound , but they are very flexible . I need to have alot of pick speed . These slow me down way to much . The other reviews I read stated that these were like rigid picks , but no they are not . Too bad as i had high hopes.Good picks if you do n't have to tremolo pick , not very good if do have to .	-1
These came stock on my Jackson Kelly KEXMG . All the other guitars I own have Schaller buttons on them and I have one main strap I use for all of the guitars . I figured since the guitar came with them I would try them out . Not twenty min later I was removing them and putting Schaller buttons in their place . Here the 3 major reasons I did not like them over Schaller:1- Bulky . They stick out too far and on any guitar with a strap button on the back it jabs you in the stomach or below ! 2- Problems engaging . I would push them into the receiver and they pop back out . It was n't until I forced them in while pushing the button that they went in a stayed in . Schallers click in and you know they are ready to go.3- Cheap . They just feel cheap . Thin metal is used in comparison to the Schallers ; which have a very heavy and solid feel to them.For a few bucks more I 'll stick with Schaller 's . I have been using them for 10+ years and have never seen one fail .	-1
This is my first guitar belt , it is not a good fit , the connection to the guitar is far too thick , I try to not remove it too often as it is highly inconvenient and hard to manage . Other than that it is usable , sort of , but I am thinking of getting some kind of metal hook instead , the thick leather is so unpleasant to deal with .	-1
I thought something was drastically wrong with my guitar but it was these strings , they buzzed and move so much they hit every metal on every fret .	-1
Lets face it , in general string winders are pretty much all the same right ? WRONG ! I went with this one because I trusted the Dunlop name . What a let down . on the second guitar I used it on the handle and the head separated , sure you can press it back together , but after separating several times on every string , it gets a little old ... .quick . Already ordered a different one to replace it . One thing I cant stand is inferior tools .	-1
I wanted to like this . I really did . The idea of an amp this portable and cheap just made me think , & # 34 ; Perfect & # 34 ; . However , the unit I received was cr @ p , and I 'm going to assume it was defective and not blanket all the positive reviews with dispersions . The one I got kept cutting in and out . You might be playing a solo line and you might hear about 75 % of the notes or something . And when holding a chord , the sustained sound would cut out after a few seconds . Frustrating.I did weigh whether or not to try a replacement unit . The so-so sound and overall quality however did n't compel me to give it another go . Bummer . Any suggestions for an amp of similar size and portability ? Cheers	-1
From the product description , I expected something far more robust than this unit . By and large , I 've had great experiences with Behringer pedals , but this reverb unit is the wimpiest I have ever used in 40 years of playing - no stronger than the reverb in a 5w First Act amplifier .	-1
I give the product a 4star for doing what it is supposed to do . I give it a single star because it failed two weeks after the return period . Generously , I 'll give it 2stars . Something like this really should last at least a year or more . Cheap parts/manufacturing ? 50 cents a day is not a good deal for a device of this nature .	-1
Do n't buy this Chinese piece of crap if you really need a three guitar stand . It is barely workable for two.It is easy to set up , but the way the neck brackets are arranged you are only going to get two guitars comfortably on it and even then guitars can still slip off the stand even when you tighten the little rubber thingies on top to hold the neck in place . And you absolutely have to keep that tight or your guitar will at some point turn sideways and fall to the floor/ground.The best thing these stands are built for are V Type guitars such as my Jackson Rhoads as long as you can put them back to back . For Les Paul and Strat type axes , their rounded lower bout curvatures make them prone to slipping on the narrow , stick like feet of the stand , especially when they are new . You ca n't tilt the feet up to try to lend more stability to the way the guitars hang because the feet wo n't support enough weight to make that possible . So this thing utterly fails in its designation as a three guitar stand . If you just got ta buy something from On Stage , get the double hang because there is more separation between instruments and so it ends up being better balanced . But really , you should just pass entirely on either the triple hang or the double hang.This is definitely a case of one gets what one pays for .	-1
The velcro itself is insanely amazing . Its so amazing that its stronger than the adhesive backing . If you have an alternative means to adhere this velcro to its surface with a strength stronger than 10 men , then by all means , use this stuff . In the end , you just ca n't make velcro this strong for use with a pedal board . Once together , it raises the height of the pedal very uncomfortably . I can not think of a practical application for this velcro .	-1
I 've ordered two of these kits in the aged white , and each one has had severe scratches and scuffs all over the tremolo cavity cover plate . Literally to the point where it looks like someone dropped them on a concrete floor , accidentally stepped on them , and then decided they were good enough to send out for sale . The knobs , covers and tips are all in great shape , however .	-1
I bought a Glaesel Bridge & this Glaesel rubber mute together . I bought this because it was cheap and had so many good reviews . The mute fits the bridge fine , but compared to a brass mute ( which of course works VERY well ) this mute seems to do absolutely nothing . There is almost no discernible difference in playing the violin with or without this mute on . Also , the mute can affect your playing so certain notes screech or stutter or produce other undesirable noises.If You want or need a mute for practicing quietly ( as many of us do ) , I suggest you buy something else . This item does not work and is a total waste of money . I tried this mute on a regular acoustic violin as well as a new Electric Violin bought here on Amazon ( FYI , that cheap little electric violin is an awesome & fun item ! *Just make sure you buyThe Original Peg Drops by Ardsley & aGlaesel Self-Adjusting 4/4 Violin Bridge Mediumwith it ! ) .I consider this mute completely useless since it does not do anything at all . It does *not* mute or lower the volume of any violin in any noticeable way .	-1
Bought this rosin to see how I would like it . I have a very light hand on the bow , so I like a rosin that is on the aggressive side . This is not . Since all fiddlers have their own styles you have to deal with trial & error .	-1
Tuner works great . Both by vibration and mic.Only real problem is the fact that the joint between the tuner and the clip is really weak . Mine broke off ... not even a year old .	-1
Purchased these for a new Heritage H-575 arch top . A few months later , the high E string unwound from the ball end . Overall good strings , good sound -- this set simply did n't last very long . I will replace with 12s however . For me the 11s felt a little loose . The 12s will likely improve the sound of the jazz box . I have 12s on an Epiphone Joe Pass model . I 'll be curious to hear how the 12s sound incomparison to the 11s .	-1
A very boring , dull , uninspiring Pedal . Do n't waste your time with this . A Boss SD-1 or Digitech Bad Monkey are far better options for this price range .	-1
Barring any interference from any other devices or radio stations broadcasting on the same frequency and any manufacturer 's defects ... the unit does what it was meant to do . I do however question whether the word `` Pro '' should apply to this system . Although the 1/4 inch mono plug that comes with the receiver offers the ability of plugging directly into most powered speaker systems or to a mixer , the overall quality of the audio brought back memories of mornings standing outside the classroom with my schoolmates and listening first to the national anthem being played and then announcements coming out of the pa system . The signal does experience some fading when the transmitter is moved about . To its defense , it is fighting against a radio music station broadcasting at near band frequency which can be received if the transmitter is off or further than 25 feet away.After playing with the device for a couple more minutes , I noticed that any movement whether I kept the receiver and transmitter stationary and I moved about my home or moved just the transmitter about severely affected the quality of the reception . Even the length of the mic cord , whether wound up or straight or even just gathered around the sending unit had an adverse effect on the sound output quality . YIKES ! ! ! Perhaps its because of the competing signal its receiving from another source which I previously described above . I 'm afraid this would not be a very usable and dependable device for my purposes . I 'll probably be returning this unit asap .	-1
I bought this unit for a friend , and I could compare with others overdrives I already have . I think the MXR Badass Custom Modified Overdrive or Way Huge Green Rhino are better choise .	-1
Really wanted to like this one , because I loved the price . There is no way this is true bypass . The one I got was defective out of the box , and so when I checked , I saw the circuitry did not support pass through . Maybe it is because I received a defective one , but I still would n't try this brand name . I am now stuck saving up for a Full Tone or something .	-1
I would think it would be reasonable to assume that this would fit a Squier Bullet Strat , but the holes did n't line up , it did n't fit between the neck and the bridge , in fact , it was completely wrong . Nice quality though .	-1
Bought this because of all the great reviews , ButThis does n't work , just like the last Beringer product I bought . Will I ever learn ? Very disappointing.UPDATE- Now working ; got my mate an Aussie genius to have a look.Found pedal was n't engaging when pushed down.Took plastic cover off and pressed black button with his pinky and light came on ; sheer genius.Worked fine with cover off ; then replaced cover with new bit of rubber . And it still works.Amazing sound actuallyStill not sold on Berhinger though	-1
I 'm a pro-cheapo and I hated this thing . They 're noisy , and the cables feel really cheap , gummy-like . Drop few more bucks and get something else !	-1
I purchased the H4n after being unhappy with the H2 's performance most significant where I could n't record a good sounding signal that was n't distorted with the Line In jack . Only to find that the H4n has the same problem but not as bad . If I try to record a line level signal from a sound board or stereo receiver and connect to the H4n 's 1/4 inch jacks , it is almost impossible to not to have a distorted signal . It appears that on both models the line in preamp is too sensitive and clips very easily and because it is clipping in the preamp , adjusting the gain does n't correct it . I contacted Zoom 's tech support about the H2 and was told that I likely had a defective unit . I returned the H2 and decided to give Zoom another chance and try the H4n after seeing many positive reviews.I really like the H4n 's design , the menus and controls are nicely organized . It feels more sturdy than the H2 . The recording quality using the built in mics is excellent . Most other recorders in this price range do n't have XLR inputs . Since I plan to use it mostly for recording concerts by connecting to a line out or tape out on a sound board , if the line in jacks do n't work properly and ca n't accept a normal line level signal without clipping , I ca n't use this for what I bought it for . I have used my Sony minidisc recorder for the same type of application for the past 8 years and have never had any problems . I 've worked with pro sound equipment for over 25 years and have used many types of recorders and so far the Zoom products are the only ones where I have encountered this problem . If you are using this to record with mics , it works great , but if you need to record from line level sources , the Zoom recorders may not be a good choice . I exchanged this for the Tascam DR-07 and while the Tascam does n't have as many bells and whistles , It is a nice recorder and I 'm very happy with it .	-1
DOA ... no good , out of the box , plug it , nothing ... ..no way to send it back ( I ` m not from the States ) ... .meaning ... I just wasted away $ 40 something bucks ( add shipping ) ... .I did bought a Behringer pedal before ( Tremolo/Pan ) with good results , but I guess there ` s two sides to this particular low economy pedals ... .Well , I ` ll man up and buy something else ...	-1
UPDATED 3/16/2014After owning the 2i2 for over a year and encountering many difficulties I am revising my once gleaming review.The 2i2 is a simple set-up . Pretty much run your monitors into the line outputs , connect a mic or ( apparently ) a `` low-headroom '' instrument to it , run the USB cable to your computer and set it up within the DAW described parameters . It would have been nice to know that the included Plug In Suite is not a stand-alone program , and that it functions in tandem with Ableton Live Lite and that it could be found it in the Plug-Ins section of Ableton , but I figured it out EVENTUALLY regardless . ( Ableton itself is rather dodgy , and seems to crash constantly . ) Sometimes the 2i2 seems to lock up completely , so as no audio is being produced from my monitors ! I was n't sure for a very long time if this was USER ERROR , an Ableton problem , or the fault of the 2i2 and its drivers , so after the gazillionth crash , I screamed `` Ballsdogit ! ! ! `` , and purchased a license for Reaper . After going through the painstaking setup and acclimating to the new DAW over the last few months , I began to realize that my monitors no longer `` lock up '' , but that the drivers for the 2i2 are indescribably pathetic ! ! ! I had to tweak the living daylights out of Reaper just to get an audible sound out of my monitors . Now I 'm in there and the FX do not work with the focusrite drivers . Garbage focusrite ! Everyone I know that has Reaper raves about the plug-ins , and the greatness and ease of the setup regardless of the interface . I have yet to experience a crash , but I also have yet to experience any recording time.Seriously , I started reading on the Reaper Forums about problems encountered with the 2i2 , and came across a response from David @ focusrite actually saying that `` you should not use this setup to record electric guitar.. '' , and that if you need to record electric guitar you should `` get something with more headroom like the 2i4 . '' That is just unbelievable in my eyes ! I 'm sure I could run this through my mixer and get the lacking headroom and just use this paperweight as a bridge gap between my mixer and laptop , but why should I have to after dropping a buck fifty on this miracle ? Besides that , I 'll more than likely still have multiple problems with the drivers ! This device is clearly marked for both XLR inputs and 1/4 instrument ins . There was no warning of headroom limitations anywhere in the documentation , and I researched audio interfaces for several weeks before deciding on this unit . I feel lied to and disrespected as a customer , now stuck with an irrelevant piece of outdated technology . HOW IN THE HECK DOES THIS THING HAVE A NEARLY 5 STAR RATING ! ! ! ? ? ? ? The good side is that the mic pres are nice and warm . I have a bunch of different mics and the 2i2 ( when not crashing or locking up the monitors ) seems to handle all of them well . I constantly check for driver updates , and have the latest drivers for the 2i2 , but without a doubt the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 is probably going by the wayside along with my faith in focusrite and their products.Sorry focusrite , you dropped the ball here .	-1
I got this for my Boss Loop Station , but it does n't work very well . I keep hoping I 'll find something it DOES work well with ...	-1
Does n't wotk with V-Amp 3 . Doubt it works at all . Red light always stays on and I 've never seen the green light .	-1
I got a couple of these ... .only buy this cable if there is NO CHANCE that it will be ever used in the real world ... .after only a month mine has developed a nasty short in the plug ... .and of course , since this cord is molded/sealed up tight , it ca n't be repaired ... ... .you could cut off the plug and solder a good 1/4 inch plug on it ... but why bother . ? ... .just save your headaches and money and buy a good heavy duty cord ... .this cord is too flimsy ... ... its junk with a fancy molded plastic ergonomic looking plug housing ... but inside its junk ... .thrown away money. ! ! ! ... ... .buy a lottery scratch off instead , , ,	-1
This cover does not fit a full size acoustic/electric Hohner guitar . I measured the whole at 3 7/8 & # 34 ; , but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! It measures 4 1/6 & # 34 ; in diameter , so check your guitar closely !	-1
I dont know what all the hype is over this thing . The idea is good and its cute . Its for kids and metal heads that want to play screaming guitar but not blow the windows out . How many of these types of noise boxes do we need ? Not only for the price you need to have a speaker cabinet to go with it . Go buy a 20 watt Roland cube at least you can play some clean guitar also . Or any combo little amp . It 's for bedroom use only . You have a external power supply to hook up to it then you need a speaker wire . Being light weight as it is also if you move around with your guitar you will pull it off the speaker cabinet and drag it around the stage with you . Just get a distortion pedal at least it stays in one spot .	-1

I am a fan of Planet Waves NS capos , but this new one is not very well designed . The way it sits on the guitar is sort of backwards . I find my left hand hitting the lever when I 'm in open position . Frustrating . It does have a pick holder , which can be handy , and a place to put an NS tuner , which can also be handy . I just think it could have been better designed . I do n't particularly care for this capo and will likely not use it for much stuff . I 'll stick to my other NS Planet Waves capo or my old faithful Kyser .	-1
The vibrations produced at touching piano keys are transmitted to the microphone . It now rest at bottom of a box .	-1
The cable died on me in less than a month . Very disappointed in built quality .	-1
Hi Folks ! OK , this thing is cheap . That 's cool . But a cheap item you ca n't use is money thrown away . Before buying this I had read various reviews of some folks liking it and others saying it 's too small . Well , I want to clear this up once and for all . IT IS TOO SMALL ! Specifically , it is too short to reach across all six strings if you go past the third fret or so ( depending on your guitar ) , AND it does n't open wide enough to be able be slid down past the third fret , even on a skinny neck . This thing really is a puzzler . I mean , who the hell would make capos this size , especially when they could 've made capos that actually fit for the same production price and sold them at the same price ? Someone somewhere is just plain ass stupid . HOWEVER , a positive from this whole mess is that I finally found a capo to use with my ukulele , and for way cheap , ha ha . But if you are looking for a capo for a guitar of any size , this is utter garbage . Cheers !	-1
This is a basic EQ pedal , that is a bit noisy in my testing . Even when running on battery power , there is a bit of hiss that is just enough to be annoying in my rig and probably enought to be very annoying in some higher gain rigs .	-1
Just assembly for a try , only few rolls with music , it 's had some hole on head , that 's mean bad quality . buyer beware for this kind of .	-1
Well 3 hours to put together got tiring and annoying as things tend to fall a part..however as a standalone items it is great with good sounds and groove tracks to practice drumming on..However I am not a drummer nor have any interest in becoming one..I bought this in order to use with software recording for basic beats to fit my own songs..and it is a NIGHTMAREGoing on a week now no support help from either company..HEED MY WARNING IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS WITH NI , EZ DRUMMER OR OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE THAT YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO REROUTE MAPPING OF MIDI IN ORDER TO USE IT . This is not a plug and play item you will spend hours of your time trying to get this to work with software ... There is very little helpful info out on the net i 've owned this for over a week and still never used it for its purpose yet being that its a stand alone item..there really is no MIDI support..Im am close to giving up the fight and sending it back.Alesis could have made this an amazing item and 1000 times easier if they simply created a midi out port on the module you could run into your daw and software..	-1
I use Clayton 1.26mm picks , a heavy pick but certainly not oversized . My picks do n't fit ! ! ! If I shove them in , I ca n't get them out . Also , this thing is huge for the back of the neck .	-1
The Good : This is a good tool to practice guitar with headphones.The Bad : The tones are not good by any stretch of the imagination , unless you like hyper-distorted noise . The cleans sound artificial and the crunch tones have obvious digital distortion applied . The effects are hit and miss as well . Plate reverb is decent but spring reverb is so artificial sounding that it 's downright offensive.Throw in the fact it chews through batteries , the software interface you use to program it on your computer is really difficult to use , and how it loses its small-and-portable-factor with a guitar cable , headphone cable , and power adapter plugged into it , I 'd be hard-pressed to recommend this product unless you really need to practice through headphones .	-1
I have been using this gig bag for the past few months . If I do the math , I probably did n't use it more than 10 times , basically from home to the subway , from the subway to the studio and back , so maybe 20 minutes walk each time . So I used it for about 3 hrs and 20 minutes , mostly carrying it on my shoulders , sometimes by one of the two handles.Then the side handle started coming apart : the seam ripped on the side and the handle will eventually fall off if used . It will be OK for a while until the shoulder straps start breaking ( which I kind of expect at this point ! ) . Meanwhile I 'm going to buy another ( sturdier ) gig bag.Save your money and get something better than this .	-1
Man , this thing would not even hold my normal sized picks ! DO NOT BUY - it is a wast of money ... ug !	-1
I was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product . A work-around for the main issue follows the review . The flaws that bother me in order of significance are:1 ) Quality : Very weak soft-metal screws . Using minimal force and a well aligned driver there was some damage to the screw-heads on all 4 that I worked with . 2 of them rounded out so much that I was afraid they would be hard to remove later , causing me to run to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws.2 ) Engineering : The instructions recommend , and the screws ( the ones that come with the straplocks ) are designed for a # 2 Phillips screwdriver . However , a standard # 2 driver is too big to fit into the strap-buttons . So you are likely to have to choose between grinding down a screwdriver to fit , or using a # 1 which will increase the impact of the first problem above since it is the wrong tool for the job.3 ) Engineering : The point of connection for the strap is 5/8th of an inch out from the guitar . The strap button has a radius about 3/16ths of an inch . Therefore any lateral stress ( i.e . weight of the guitar ) is magnified by more than 3x due to leverage pulling outward on the screw . A 9 pound guitar would be applying a constant 27 to 30 pounds of force on the screw and the wood around it ( half that when the weight is distributed evenly on two strap buttons of course ) . Get a little too active on stage and the level of force could go way higher.Realistically , if the screws were n't total crap , this might have been a 3 or 4 star review . Once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver wo n't fit and get the things properly installed , it would probably work out for most people . So if you are stuck with a set , here 's what I recommend : Go to a hardware store and buy # 6 x 1 '' oval-head stainless steel replacement screws . Note that these wo n't fit properly , but they are the closest match and can be modified . ( They are 21 cents each at my local stores , and would have cost Dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this . ) Put the screw into an electric drill ( pointy end in ) so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill . Run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head . It does n't need much . I used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each . While you are at it , file down a cheap # 2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button.Install with the new screws as normal , and recommend that your friends try a different brand !	-1
ok when i saw the bag i was impressed nice looking and perfect style so i decided to buy it but the bag just arrive home `` 12/23/11 '' and is way different from the one on the picture is a black bag with one ugly red line on the middle and it looks like is not going to protect my guitar i am really upset , i would not returned because i do n't feel like fighting with no body but they should n't do that to the costumer we pay how much they asking so a least we should get what we pay for .	-1
I ordered 1 just to try it since it was so cheap , the first one arrived in non working condition , wires inside werent even soldered , so i ordered a replacement , plugged it in and it didnt work either , the second wasnt soldered either.I know its cheap , but i expected it to at least work , do not buy	-1
Well , what can I say ? Based on the customer reviews , this purchase seemed like a no-brainer . However , after only 4 months of light use ( used on my rig at home ) it is toast . The cable barely holds a signal now ( constantly need to jiggle the thing to work ) . And before you ask , & # 34 ; is it perhaps your output jack ? & # 34 ; , all of my other cables work with my gee-tar . So it is definitely the cable : ( Anyway , I gave it 2 stars because while it WAS working it sounded great through my Roland JC120 .	-1
The Chorus is subtle ... but it seems lacking to me . It is subtle but really weak compared to the classic rich ibanez chorus i have .	-1

Not a great mic , but if you need something realitively cheap , it 'll do . Limited dynamic range . But , it works . Wish I 'd have gotten something a little nicer though .	-1
I purchased this stand for my electric guitar and used it for a couple of weeks before the weak weld broke on the neck holder at the top when I placed my guitar in it . Upon close inspection , the weld was very poor and barely attached the neck holder to the upright tube . The tubing is made from very thin round steel tubing that is maybe .025 & # 34 ; wall , so do n't expect it to take much abuse before it snaps off- even if it is welded better than mine was . Just folding the legs repeatedly back and forth will likely cause it to break or pop out one of light duty aluminum rivets on the legs- it is literally that thin of metal tubing.For $ 10-11 I did not expect perfection , so to it 's credit- it is foam covered where it needs to be and has never scratched my guitars.This stand does have one other good quality- it is CHEAP ! Since it was less that $ 11 , I can not see going through the hassle of returning it . I was able to carefully weld mine back together- but this would probably not be an option for most . The stand might work fine if you do n't fold it up regularly and if you leave it set up- but If you need portability and durability- I would definitely purchase a better quality stand .	-1
Pedal is not working , it just making noise . Poor quality control.Actually it looks like used pedal , not like new.Do n't recommend this product .	-1
I 've been playing guitar for over 40 years , and these Tortex picks are nearly the worst I'v ever used . They are so noisy that they overpower the guitar strings with their clackity-clack noise . Dunlop Ultex picks sound much better .	-1
When I originally went out to place this order , I was planning to order the TC Electronics Singles VoiceTone C1 Vocal Effects Processor for its pitch correction function . As I looked over that device and some alternatives , I finally ordered the TC-Helicon Mic Mechanic because it had pitch correction and some other very nice effects . I ignored the reviewers who said the pitch correction function had no effect - how could TC Electronics put out the & # 34 ; Mic Mechanic & # 34 ; with a pitch correction function that did n't do anything ? Well , those reviewers were right - the pitch correction function has NO EFFECT ! Also , I could n't see any effect between engaging/disengaging the tone button . I kept the Mic Mechanic because I like the other effects , but I 'm very disappointed in the primary reason I bought it !	-1
The tension screw adjustment remains the best of any capo I 've ever used - and I 've tried many over the years . But what was Ned smoking when he decided to have the trigger handle and main support stem , including the pick clip and tuner holder , protude outward away from the fingerboard ? It 's awkward to apply and remove quickly . It 's visually distracting for player and audience , and it does n't add any mechanical benefit to the already excellent tension adjustment.The only possible justification I can come up with is having less to obstruct the fretting hand behind the neck - but even that does n't fly . Regardless of capo tension you should position it as close to the fret as practical and , unless you 're avoiding playing that first fret ( or use a low-thumb classical fret hand position ) you 're always going to feel some part of the capo against the leading edge of your hand . I own the older Planet Waves tri-action capo and never felt that to be a problem.Otherwise the construction of the NS Artist Capo is superb . The surface is arched , probably between a 10-12 radius that works fine on various Strat fingerboards as well as a flatter SG/LP style . It does n't work as well on the very flat 16 radius of my Martin OM-1 which is virtually the same as a classical . If I cranked the tension it 's possible the rubber would flatten out but I would n't risk marring the neck wood.I tried both the pick and tuner clips and they 're functional , but to be honest I would n't use either - too distracting and I only use tuners to get an initial A , then tune each guitar to itself or to other instruments , depending on what they are.The only other capo I 've ever used that protudes outward is the Kyser with its notorious 'wrought iron fence ' design . I have one and , as good as the holding action is , I 've never felt comfortable with the design . The older Planet Waves capo is still available so it comes down to preference.To top off the confusion , the picture on the front of the cardboard card the NS Artist comes mounted on shows a similar capo positioned in a way that 's impossible with this capo !	-1
I ordered this plug because it is advertised as a & # 34 ; 1 Spot & # 34 ; brand plug . It is not what I received . Instead I received a generic plug for eight 9v connections that would definitely fit the purpose , but a really cheap version . The plugs on this generic version are larger than the 1 Spot and the wires are kind of stiff plastic . The original 1 Spot plug has much smaller plugs , great for saving space on a pedal board , and the wires are soft and & # 34 ; rubbery & # 34 ; , again making it easier to work with on a pedal board , specially if you 're working with a pedal board like Pedaltrain where you can intertwine wires in and out between bars . I informed the seller about the issue and was told it was a mistake and that they would send me the correct one . In my email to them I included an image of the original packaging of the 1 Spot 8 Plug to make sure there would be no mistake , but to my amazement they sent me another compatible plug . I emailed them again for a refund , which they promptly did . I can say , that they did respond quickly and they refunded my money . I imagine that those who order this plug without ever having worked with an original 1 Spot plug , would n't know the difference because although it is a really cheap version it does have eight 9v connectors . I strongly recommend , spend the extra two or three dollars and get the original 1 Spot 8 Plug .	-1
Does n't reduce sound worth a darn . I thought plugging the sound hole would muffle things . Muddies it up a bit maybe , but not really a reduction in dB .	-1
I bought one of these for a vintage Fender Showman that does n't have built in reverb . Put a battery in and plugged it in . Very simple . But the sound was horrible ! No setting delivered an effect that sounded anything like any kind of reverb I ever heard or would want to hear . The closest I could get was a cheesy delay or echo effect that sounded awful . On the other hand , the reverb from my Korg AX-100G ( that I was using on another rig ) was great . Maybe my DR600 was not functioning properly , but I do n't think so . I think that 's the way it really sounds . So I got a return authorization from Amazon ( very easy - never fails ) , put it back in the box and UPS picked it up the next day and I got a full refund.JM Tepper	-1
A loud hum will crescendo in every few minutes even if the ground is lifted . Works great in intervals though , too bad those intervals are minutes .	-1
The material it 's made of is good , and it holds the guitar . The only things i do n't like are 2.1 ) Each of the corners has a cap . The one at the bottom where you actually put the guitar it comes off.2 ) The part at the bottom that looks like a U ( used to hold the guitar ) it spins ... It means that there is nothing like a bolt or a screw to make it stay still , so every time you try to put your guitar on you have to make sure to put that straight.I would suggest to but a more expensive model or a totally different one .	-1
Not happy with the sellers description or the product . The description says `` Heavy Duty '' which makes you assume that it 's a regular hard plastic Mic Clip , but it 's not . IT 'S RUBBER ! ! ! It sucks . Used it a couple times and it 's hard to slide the mic in and I can see after a couple more uses how it 's probably going to need to be taped because the swivel will become very loos cause the rubber will wear down quickly , and flex . IT 'S FLEXIBLE ! ! ! Who uses Flexible Mic Clips ? ! ! ! Make sure you do n't buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead .	-1
I honestly really did n't find this thing useful at all . First , the wire clipper side is relatively bulky ( no flush cutting ) and does n't open easily ( very stiff action ) , so trying to get the clipper onto the wire with the very small opening and at the same time peering over the tool itself as it blocks the view - ick . And as for the winder ... I suppose if you are doing some heavy initial winding , it can get rather tiring twisting the tuner . But it is a tad big for tuner pegs on anything I used it on , so no nice & # 34 ; tight & # 34 ; fit , more of a & # 34 ; jiggle & # 34 ; fit . Plus the clearance needed to actually swing the thing around means having the instrument laying flat on a table does n't help . Did n't even know there was a bridge pin puller on this thing . Just looked at it ... guess that notch in the peg winder is it.Each time I have set out to use it , I end up turning my pegs manually and grimacing over the stiff action of the wire cutters while to align it on the string . I just recently ended up buying a set of Crescent Brand Miniature Cutters & Needle-Nose Pliers Set ( the pliers are JUST the thing for pulling the strings and keeping tension while winding ) . When I have to redo my mothers acoustic guitar , I 'll try the notch bridge peg puller . But other wise , this thing gets a serious two-star & # 34 ; meh & # 34 ; .	-1
It 's really not a 200w system . The booklet even says it is only 100 watts , and I doubt it is really even that powerful . The wireless microphone only works when you put your mouth about an inch from it . My Shure XLR wired microphones do not work with it even with an adapter plug . The instrument input works OK with my Taylor guitar , but it 's not 100 watts loud . I guess it 's OK as a portable guitar amp in a small venue without any vocals .	-1
Could not get to fit small sound hole . Once in sound hole pickup did not work at all . Would not buy it .	-1
I bought this to use on my Fender P-bass . It is not reliable for me , sometimes it works and sometimes it ca n't find the low note correctly . I 'm still using my Roland stomp box tuner . Glad this was inexpensive , it was not worth the hassle to return , i gave it away .	-1
I used AC30 for years , lost them , and decided to make a change and buy these.Sound quality of AC30 was n't anything to write home about but had decent cleans and gains , but this one has a horrendous clean ( tried with my strat and tele , play jazz/blues mostly ) , and mediocre gain , you can get a lot better sound even with the free amp programs for ipod and computers ( buying a 25-35 buck connector cable ) , though , granted those tend to have feedback problems when you use certain gain-y settings.For people worried about CONSTRUCTION , these turned out to be very sturdy ( AC30s i previously used did , but the built/materials are exactly same ) .Even if you 're determined to settle for the mediocrity of phone amps , go for cheaper models , or simply buy AC30 , the latter has acceptable cleans..	-1
I purchased this instrument brand new , on an impulse whim due to a managers-choice sale at a local music shop that I simply could not ignore . It was brand new , unopened , in box . They allowed me to examine it prior to purchase . In that environment I thought it a nice instrument.However , it can be difficult to properly examine an instrument in a busy store , and that store was VERY busy and noisy . It 's when you get it home and can examine it leisurely in peace and quiet that the details stand out.This is indeed a 6-string ukulele . It measures a bit over 28 '' top to bottom and has the sound of a baritone uke . I have heard throatier and more mellow instruments in the same price range . The advantage to this of course is it 's 6 string , so if you 're a guitar player you can achieve the ukulele sound and portability without learning totally new fingering ... . that is of course , until you realize that while it has 6 strings , it is not tuned like a guitar . It 's tuned to ADGCEA rather than EADGBE . One can not simply play guitar music on this instrument ; all such music has to be transposed or new chord name recognition learned . Being a total newbie to ukes , this was news to me until I got it home and read the instructions . So my primary purpose in purchasing this -- to have a small portable guitar , hit a snag.Now that 's not totally the end of the thing , because you can be a little inventive and use alternate string sizes to tune this to standard guitar tuning . It takes a bit of experimentation but it is possible to set this up to standard guitar tuning if one does n't mind buying a couple of string sets and playing mixup . So all is not lost there . It was just an unexpected surprise -- mainly because I did n't research the instrument prior to purchase ( it 's rare that I impulse buy ) .So tuning aside we get to the quality of instrument . That 's where the Yamaha really falls short . This is an oil rather than a lacquer or shellac finish and in several places the oil was still visible and could be wiped away by hand . There were a couple of glitches in the finish straight out of the box . That this was a `` rush job '' out of a factory with no finish work at all was blatantly obvious.There are no strap pegs ; those will require being added by hand ( not difficult , but extra expense and time ) .The action is of course too high . That 's not unusual -- in truth it 's quite common in off-the-shelf stringed instruments and came as no surprise . But along with the other failures in workmanship it stood out here.However , the thing that bothers me the most : if I was n't aware this is a Yamaha Guitalele ... I 'd think it 's was a cheap knock-off child 's guitar . There 's not one thing about this instrument that says `` quality '' -- which is quite disappointing . This instrument sells for about $ 100 . That low cost is obvious . This is a `` cheap guitar '' in every way . I ca n't honestly say it 's a toy , but it reeks `` beginner instrument '' . The tuners are as cheap as they come , the finish is cheap , there is no decoration , no protective edging . The finish is -- unfinished.I bought this solely based on the number of positive reviews here on Amazon -- and I respect those reviews . People have different tastes and for some folks this has a `` home made '' feel that they will love . However I 've been playing guitar for ( mumblety mumble ) deca ... uh ... years and I know the difference between quaint and cheap . I own two Ovation guitars , a Peavey electric bass , a hand-made violin and an Epiphone electric uke ( which is of such higher quality it 's not even a contest . And no I 'm not hawking Epiphone . Facts is facts , that 's all . You can read my very-positive review on the Epiphone on Amazon ) .When I got this home and took a good look at it , I found no sign of quality or craftsmanship , nothing that said anything more than `` this was made as cheaply and quickly as humanly possible '' . In truth the only positive thing I have to say about it is that it does have a spruce top and the strings are of reasonably decent quality.Other than those two factors , one can find $ 40- $ 50 full-size guitars all over Amazon that equal or surpass this instrument in quality . The only benefit this would offer is its smaller size and ukulele voice -- if someone particularly wants an inexpensive portable guitar tuned like a uke . Other than its portability , I find no special merit in this and even at its relatively low price ... consider it over-priced ( or rather , under-made ) .One must grant it 's largely a matter of personal taste and expectation . But low quality is low quality . ( Edit two weeks later : I just today saw the Cordoba at a local store -- a direct competition to this instrument . The Cordoba is MUCH nicer . It 's built better , has better sound , and is finished out much more nicely . Sorry Yamaha , but facts is facts . Had I seen the Cordoba and Yamaha side by side , I 'd have bought and kept the Cordoba . ) That 's my honest review . I know some will disagree . But others know exactly what I mean . This is n't an expensive instrument so one really ca n't expect super-fine quality at this price . However -- I paid about the same price for my electric uke and it is superb quality from top to bottom . As mentioned , the Cordoba is a better instrument and costs the same.Fortunately the local merchant has a satisfaction guarantee and I was able to return it . I simply can not recommend this instrument unless there are no better options -- and frankly , there are .	-1
Ok I understand it now - I use Abelton Live 8 and thought this would be and easy , read cheap , interface to record some instruments with . WRONG ! I am returning it . It does not work , has no drivers and is not detected on my Mac ( my Mac finds everything ) . Bought the Focusrite unit instead . Got it to work on garage band but latency was miserable and so was hiss on recordings . Save your money and time . Buy the Focusrite interface or one of the others . Yes over $ 100 but you either want feedback , hiss and frustration or you want a smooth interface connection with good resonance . It also lacks 1/4 plug , one rca input , you need an addapter . Not what I thought I was getting - dumb me .	-1
The cable arrived on time and the it looked nice for ten minutes . I don '' t like how the tips screw on and off and the fabric shielding slid out of place the first time I used it . The cable worked well for about two weeks but then it lost current in the middle of a session and I lost sound . This cable is complete garbage . Never again !	-1
It just randomly pops off my bass , it 's so slick that when you let go it the neck just goes straight down . I hate it .	-1
For the price I can hardly complain , but unfortunately the item was not the correct size for a Fender Strat replacement . Checked it Against my American Standard , MIM Strat and Squier and it would not fit any of them . Should have just used one of my dog 's chew bones and cut it myself , would have been more accurate .	-1
This is shown on an electric guitar and it would probably be great there . I play acoustic guitars and the headstocks all angle back it has to attach at the top then it is hard to see the screen . It worked but I do n't use it anymore .	-1
I recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars . One was in the SKB Fender case ( $ 99.95 on Amazon ) , the other in this Gator case purchased locally . I was told it was just as good as the Fender case . Both ended up in checked luggage . After 1 flight from Florida to LAX and back ( non-stop , minimal handling ) the glue on the top section gave up . The padding is now loose and the strap to keep the top from flopping completely open is dangling inside the case . Neither guitar was damaged and the cases appear in fine shape , but after having the padding fall out , I just ordered another SKB Fender case . The Gator will be re-glued and used only for local trips . The SKB Fenders will be my airline cases from now on .	-1
I was very excited to try this pedal when it finally arrived . Just to find out it WAS N'T WORKING ! ! ! it is defective , and because i brought it to Mexico , now i ca n't get a refund or a replacement.I will try to fix it through some local electrician or something . Very dissapointing !	-1
I 've used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting . This one is the worst . The plastic screw ( yes , plastic ) that is meant to grip the pole that you attach the pop filter to , is completely incapable of supporting it 's own weight at nearly any angle . Bad ... just bad.Secondly , there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp . It seemed loose after I got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement . After twisting on it twice I stripped it out . Now the thing is worthless . I 'm returning it ASAP.I would rather go to a lady 's bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing . Do yourself a huge favor and buy the Nady 6 '' pop filter . If you do n't , you 'll wish you did .	-1
I purchased this pedal at a local music store for practice and possibly doing some loops at open mics with my Roland GR55 ( which has a flawless basic looper built in , but only 20 seconds record and no undo ) . I had hoped that it would at least last one hour on with a battery so that I would n't need to carry a power adapter along.The factory battery lasted about 1 hour . The second brand new fresh Duracell battery lasted about 20 minutes . I started recording a loop with another ( 3rd ) fresh battery ( tested 9.10 v with a multimeter ) and the unit started behaving erratically after a few seconds of recording , suggesting that it was faulty . The lights started coming on and off randomly ( record/undo/all three together , then off , then undo on , then all three on etc . etc . ) The first time I used the JamMan XT ( with the factory battery ) it seemed to be working OK and all I can say is that as a basic looper it sucked.I am used to synching loops with other loopers and timing is everything , so I know it was not my poor technique . The main problem was that it did n't matter how hard I tried ( even if I did a manual fade out ) there was always a gap of about 2 seconds between the end of the loop and the start . This makes the unit useless.Also , it is poorly conceived in that , to replace the battery you have to take out 2 screws ... exposing the delicate printed circuit board.The potential for damage here is very high . Also , replacing the screws needs to be done very carefully to avoid cross threading the screws and messing up the receiver nuts which are mounted directly onto the circuit board . To save a few dollars Digitech did not have the foresight to manufacture the unit with a battery box which would have protected the electronics and possible ( read INEVITABLE ) damage.I have owned quite a few Digitech products over the years and generally they are well thought out and well constructed but they have really dropped the ball on this one.It 's going back to the store where I purchased it .	-1
This cable was very affordable , but you get what you pay for . It sounded brilliant while it was n't broken , for about the 4 hours of runtime . It works if it is n't abused at all , but if you abuse it in any way at all , your out an XLR cable . I do not recommend this product at all for heavy usage .	-1
This stand is ok for light home use . I would not recommend this thing for gigging or travel . Very cheaply made but does the job . Guitars do not rest naturally in a sweet spot . You must set a guitar down in the correct position or it will lay a bit sideways and jar other guitars on the rack . Avoid if you can spend more .	-1
Pros : -Price point-Good , clean audio quality when working.-Changeable mesh ballsCons : -Limited upper frequency response ( & # 62 ; 8kHz ) -One stopped working after about half an hour of use . It was not dropped or abused in any way.-Requires nearly direct line of sight between transmitter and receiver for any distance greater than 10 feet .	-1
Did not hold the strings down very well for me ... I love the feel of it , but the spring needs more power .	-1
This is a fantastic product that is well made . The plastic is heavy duty and comes with a plastic cover that must be removed before use . This ensures that the wheel you get is in perfect condition.The tool is extremely useful . I have just started playing with a band , and it is very common for band members to call out a song and the key that it is in . With the wheel , I immediately know what chords to choose from . I also know what notes are in each chord . In addition , it has a note by note image of the entire fretboard so that you can see where the roots are for the scale you are playing.The wheel is also invaluable for switching keys . For example , say you 're playing the I , IV , and V chords in the key of C. , but your lead singer is having trouble and would rather sing it in Bb . All you need to do is dial the wheel to Bb , find out the new I , IV , and V chords , and start playing . The wheel makes chord transposition a breeze.I feel that the negative reviews you are seeing are unfair . This is a very useful product at a fair price.No , I am not affiliated with the company at all . I 'm just a band member newbie who appreciates this tool.In my opinion , this is a five star product .	-1
Go build your own . Build it to your specs and have a solid stand . If not , you can find a lot better head stands . This one was a huge disappointment . Does not do what it says and can get you frustrated quick . Im back with my wood block and am happy .	-1
OK , it was cheap ( nine bucks at the time ) , the design looked good and sensible , and it seemed a perfect solution to a real need . I bought it without hesitation . HOWEVER ( ! ) , once hooked up , I was very surprised how flimsy it is . I have a 13 '' gooseneck , a light condenser mic and small shock-mount on it . At the slightest movement of the mic stand this attachment flaps up and down like crazy and will continue this way for a something like a minute if not stopped by hand . Obviously , any small bump into the stand will once again set this off . Using it at home , I 've gotten away with not touching the stand while recording by being very careful , but obviously this unit is far from ideal . Since then , I 've gotten another sidemount boom from this same brand , and though I have n't really put through its paces yet , this other unit is rock solid and far more adjustable and reliable , AND only costs a few bucks more ( On Stage MSA9508 Posi-Lok Sidemount Boom ) . For anyone considering this product , I HIGHLY recommend bypassing this one and forking out just a few more bucks for the On Stage MSA9508 Posi-Lok Sidemount Boom . You will be far far happier.Cheers !	-1
Compression/sustain wise , this unit is decent but I can not abide the noise ... I tolerated it for a while but wound up pulling it for a cleaner compressor ...	-1
Our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago . Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body . I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass ... not good . My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend.The problem with the design is there 's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that 's screwed into the body unscrewing itself . We 've tried applying bar soap , petro jelly , and a spray can based dry lubricant ... . none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.We are switching to the Dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero 'unscrewing ' force.We tried to make the Shallers work but just could not . Maybe we 're all too active on stage but we can not tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us .	-1
This particular brand I 've seen around and have n't heard to much about them , but the one that I got worked fine for about a couple days . It went out and I sent it in hoping to rule out the possibility that I MIGHT have gotten a bad one.And I requested in a letter when I sent it in that they send another one in exchange , That did n't work out so well , with that being the only way I COULD RATE it and never receiving a replacement to verify that i just got a bad one , I 'd have to rate this one at the bottom ...	-1
I 've been using primarily Alchemy strings for years but just got tired of spending so much for them . I figured I 'd try some others at half the price and see if any stack up.These were the first to go on , and they were a HUGE step down from what I had on . The strings I took off were probably two months old an had spots of corrosion on the high E string . They were twice as loud as these . When you take these out of the pack , they sort of flop out like wet spaghetti . They do n't do the fast unravel thing that strings typically do . The cons definitely outweigh the pros here.Pros : -Very flexible , string bends are easy-Easy on the fingersCons : -The most dull sound of any strings I 've ever heard . Especially on the low end . They 're dreadfully lacking in rich low end sound . The highs are very tinny . Almost sounds like a bad recording.-Your fingers stick when you try to slide down the strings . It 's the weirdest thing . This is especially true for the G string . It 's hard to explain , but it 's kind of like rubbing against something really clean , where your hand does that skipping sort of rub and there 's tons of squeak to boot . Anyways , it sucks . Grip is the last thing you want on your strings.Bottom line : Unless you have some wicked arthritis and just have to have super easy to bend strings , these should not be purchased . I 'll never buy again . This is the first time in my life I wanted to change brand new strings .	-1
I know the old saying you get what you pay for and that is just the case here . The unit is very light weight and the legs are too small to hold any decent mic like a RODE M1 mic or similar.I knew at this price it might not be great and took a shot , but I opened one , tried to use it and ca n't . It was a total waste of money , but does n't pay to return it . I suppose if you have a small mic that has basically no weight to it , it might serve your purpose . Again , you get what you pay for and these are indeed budget light stands .	-1
I thought I could take the smell . I couldn't.Otherwise it would be a decent deal and not bad sounding.The case is nice too , but everything smells like the Chinese rubber smell at Harbor Freight Tools . ( sulfur ? ) I tried airing it out for a week with no success.If you have no sense of smell , get one .	-1
This system works just okay . Try to turn it up and you get bad feedback.My microphone stopped working shortly after I purchased this item . I contacted Pyle to see about a replacement and got nothing but runaround from them.They could n't give me a price for repair or to purchase a new one , or where I could even buy a replacement.Very frustrating !	-1
Looked like the chrome was cheesey and they ended up breaking but they worked while they were used in a guitar with the proper pinhole next to the screw position	-1
My guitar originally came with D'Addrio exp and they sounded good . I replaced them with Elixir nanoweb coated strings and they also sounded good , but the finish was wearing fast . This time I got a 3 pack of EJ16-3d light . The were easy to put on and have held up well other than tarnishing quickly.But the sound is the problem . It 's terrible . They sound very muddy . Crisp tone distinction is just not there . I thought light would be the better route , but now I 'm not sure . I purchased some others to try . Also , since a purchased a 3 pack . I may just change the strings completely again to see If I just have some dead strings .	-1
These cans were decent , back when they were just above 100 bucks . They 've inflated to 160 and that 's just ridiculous . There is better in this price range . The SRH840 's for example on eBay for 120~ bucks new , does everything better than these cans . The M50 's have really punchy bass , and extremely stringent highs , they 're very loose in the low end , and their mids are recessed . That combination makes for a fatally tiring listening experience . The pads are pleather and terribly uncomfortable , whilst having an almost starchy texture to them . The headband clamps onto larger heads and lacks decent padding underneath . These phones are also terrible in regards to any soundstage at all , which means for gaming , these will be pretty terrible . They do some ... SOME ... new genres alright , but their extremely aggressive presentation makes these phones just hard to listen to . They also ca n't do lighter genres like Jazz and Classical due to their poor positoning . There are much much better monitors in this price range than these , the Shure SRH840 as I 've said before totally outclass these headphones in all areas.Stay away , do n't fall victim to the noob hype .	-1
I own the SN-8 , which btw , is the best tuner I 've ever used . I bought this bc it said it was made specifically for bass frequencies & violin . So I wanted to use this w my acoustic bass and violin . I was also intrigued by the & # 34 ; tighter & # 34 ; tuning aspect of the bars on this . Let me tell you , if it worked , the bars may have been a cool feature , but when you are fine-tuning an A string and it tells you you are on E ( when you know you are on A bc the other tuners all say A , and it matches the piano ) , then there is a problem . I could not find any way to re-calibrate the thing , so it looks like it 's just defective . The one I received was completely useless.I am amazed at the great SN-8 ... I am disappointed in this thing . I must have just received a dud ( I hope , since these usually get good reviews ) , but I will be returning this since it absolutely does not work correctly . On the flip side , I will be getting another SN-8 in it 's place , since I know those are great tuners & I love the one I already have .	-1
No matter how many times I hard reset my 3Gs , no success . There is no problem with my jack , and the phone is in pristine condition -- no problems until now . There is definitely a connection and communication because the mic and sample track work , but that 's about it . I registered my Amplitude app , and followed all of the instructions on the box . I tested the iRig with an iPhone 4 and was able to get it operating.I am giving this two stars because it did work on my friend 's iPhone 4 . But for my purposes with a 3Gs , it is a brick . If anyone has any suggestions that lead to successful operation , I will re-rate the product .	-1
This thing is useless . Good idea , but way too light/rickety to be useful . Unless you 're constantly aware of it , 99 % of the time you 'll end up just kicking it over when you go to put your foot on it . Pass on this .	-1
I had a friend with one of these and he loves it . I got one on his recommendation and when I put the batteries in it , it started smoking . It did work for awhile . I pulled the batteries out and tried to AC adapter and it smoked again , this time it did not work . I am one of those people who gives an item one try and if it does not work , holds a grudge . I would not advise anybody to get this .	-1
Dont last but a couple weeks..terrible feed back as the ends near the plugs detirorate quickly . Will never buy again even if only 5 bucks	-1
I bought this amp back when i didnt know much about amps . If you want the metal sound for practice , then it is hard to get a better amp for one bill . But with the hybrid amps ( Vibro Champ ) going for not much more , you get better sounds and more settings . I am selling mine and ordered a Super Champ Xd used in new condition for two and a half bills . This Line 6 amp has a flat sterile sound that isnt very warm sounding . From now on its tube amps for me , even if i have to pay the price . A good tube amp should last a long time and hold its value well , too . Like i said , for a first amp at one bill , the Line 6 isnt too bad . Maybe some day i will be able to afford a Princeton Reverb ?	-1
Tried this and was not happy . Seemed to want to be off too much . Got the Fender FT-004 instead . This one does have a great view on the LED , but if it does n't tune right , what 's the point ? I would try the Fender . Just a note . if you want a great tuner try a pedal corded tuner . I would try one at a guitar shop before purchasing . Just a thought .	-1
I heard great things about the S6 and so , being a novice without any idea of what to buy , I bought it based upon reviews . I 've played it for a year , and after spending many hours in guitar stores comparing guitars , here are my ( humble ) thoughts : - The Seagull is comparatively unattractive . Its snake-head headstock with the tiny , not-great tuners looks out of place on a dreadnaught guitar.- The cedar top is very nice looking , and the rosewood fretboard/bridge on mine are very nice.- The laminate sides/back seem much thicker than competing guitars , and this makes the guitar heavier and , to me , less & # 34 ; alive & # 34 ; /resonant during playing.- The satin-finished cedar top is very easy to marr.- The cedar is warm at low to mid strumming force , but at a heavy strum , the top seems to bottom out and lose definition.- The treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom end seems muddy.- The frets are smaller than competitors but are OK.- The binding is a sharp 90 degree angle without any radius to it so it cuts into the chest and arms after playing - something I 've not encountered before.- I can get the action very , very low before the frets rattle - nice ! All in all , it is an OK instrument that stands out simply because it 's made in Canada for Asian/Mexican prices - that said , just because it comes from Canada does n't embody it with mystical vibes . In fact , for the price range , I can get a just-as-good Asian/Mexican guitar with a nicer laminate back/front , Sitka spruce solid top wood , better tuners , and a more attractive headstock - with a gloss finish for durability and that sounds just as good.I do n't regret getting it , but I feel like I overpaid for what I received , and while the brand might have been a great deal at last decade 's exchange rates , I have seen much better guitars in shops for the same price . Seagull to me is over-hyped.Thanks for reading !	-1
the cables are great for the price cant go wrong I have not used them for a long time but so far no problems i ordered 6 more cables.do n't buy this cables they keep failing , cheap material with WHAT I SPENT ON THEM YOU COULD BUY A COUPLE DECENT ONES	-1
These things are terrible . One would n't fit in my soundboard , another would n't lock in my mic . Plain and simple ... .if your looking for crap that does n't work ... .buy this .	-1
I purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the comments that are on here lately this thing is not good . Looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless . Does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter . I would have returned it but I completely destroyed the package getting it open ( which oddly had staples holding it closed ) .	-1
It 's a decent unit , but stopped working completely after about 6 months . Tried everything I could , but it 's gone . I would not recommend this pedal .	-1
Just use a smartphone to record stuff . This is a really weird , not very intuitive little device that has been antiquated by the iphone and other smart phones . Not really worth the $ 75 - I returned mine .	-1
the thing is that they do n't seem to stay ! i mean , you can change the position of the pop filter by varying the shape of the metallic & # 34 ; arm & # 34 ; , but it does n't stay where you put it . and also the material of the filter is of kinda poor quality . but , i think if you 're lucky if just might get the job done .	-1
Like the other one star reviewers -- my problem is that the head broke off . I tried to glue it back on , but it just fell apart even worse when I tried to do that . If you buy this , you really need to baby it ! My advice is look for a more sturdy model !	-1
UPDATE : received 6 of these . 5 are ok but one has a bad weld joint at the top retainer . It was held by only one small tac weld.I got what i paid for . cheap price and cheap product . no excuse to make this kind of low quality guitar stand , putting a $ 500 guitar on this is asking for guitar damage when the stand falls apart . not worth the time & $ to send it back to amazon . One star only for this product . Good chance that you will get a crappy one if you order this . Less than one star for this piece of ... ...	-1
First Behringer pedal I have returned . Almost no effect provided by pedal . I have returned the unit . Not worth it . Lousy pedal .	-1
If you plan to use this pedal as a traditional volume pedal in a Guitar > Volume Pedal > Amp configuration ( inserting effects pedals anywhere you like ) , this is a POORLY engineered pedal . It ca n't be `` true bypass '' as long as the signal travels through a potentiometer but they can use pots that are a virtual short when adjusted properly and with the pedal forward.Anyway , the difference between plugging my guitar directly into the amp and placing this pedal in the chain between the amp is immediately noticeable . The tone becomes duller , the output drops . I would expect that from an Asian knock-off , not from an A-list gear maker . I might be over-stating Ernie Ball 's reputation , though they make some fine guitars I got ta say , and I 've used their strings for many years.If you plan to use this EB-6180 pedal with digital effects you should be fine . This is because the digital device will take two measurements of pure resistance at either end of the rocker . The signal processing takes place in the unit , not the pedal . ( Those units have their own tone problems but that 's another review . ) It does occur to me that any pedal with a buffer ( NOT `` true bypass '' in other words ) may fix this problem , which is more than likely related to impedance , like a tuner pedal , between the guitar and the volume pedal . I will need to try that out , but it does not excuse Ernie Ball from their responsibility . Major FAIL on their part.2 stars is generous because EB fails to honor the simple `` first do no harm '' principle . It harms your tone . How dumb is that ? The pedal itself is very attractive , appears indestructible , though I have my doubts about their `` string '' mechanism over time . The rocker feels smooth and the weight gives the pedal stability on the floor.I have no recommendations for a volume pedal . Because of the feel , and esthetics , I do plan to keep this for the digital device use , but wish it was able to do what it promises , and fails so miserably , to deliver .	-1
It was almost obvious this product would come from china but even worse when it ships from china . Any thing i have bought that was shipped directly from china has been much lower quality than anything retailers are even willing to sell . If you can wait a month for delivery or longer , if you dont mind your guitar falling off the wall when the chinese quality lives up to its reputation then order up . If you have over a $ 500 guitar be wise and buy an expensive one unfortunately they will most likely be made in china too . I have decided to build my own	-1
I have several MXR pedals . Every one is superb -- except for this PHASE 90 ( the non- '' script '' version reviewed here ) . This PHASE 90 is worthless for anyone who wants to use it while playing clean , for it adds a tsunami of irritating distortion , a swoosh of sonic dirt . I did some research and discovered that other people who also hate this pedal 's distortion suggest some modifications . ( Look up `` MXR Phase 90 Mods , '' and `` Erik 's Corner '' will show you how . ) I made the `` R28 , '' `` C11 , '' and `` C12 '' modifications . The result : a slightly improved phaser , one that still churned out plenty of distortion . Finally , I tried adjusting the internal trim pot . On no setting could I get rid of ... you guessed it : distortion . I spent literally hours in a futile and frustrating effort to make this pedal sound merely acceptable . No luck . BOTTOM LINE : IF YOU WANT A PHASER THAT DOES N'T ADD SIGNIFICANT DISTORTION , AVOID THIS INCARNATION OF THE PHASE 90 .	-1
These types of pedals are toys . They are a cheap way for a beginner to have effects to play with . By all means if you are buying it for your kid who just started playing . If not , i recommend slowly building your pedal collection and use the money to get 1 decent pedal whether it is a delay , or distortion .	-1
Sound is not so good . Strange how the gain has to be turned up along with the volume to hear anything .	-1
When I purchased this I 'd seriously hoped that it would make a real difference to the tone of my guitar . Guess what ? As far as I can tell , there is no difference whatsoever between this saddle and the original the guitar came with . This is NOT worth the money .	-1
From Greg Abrams review , entitled `` For all but the tone snobs , '' a review further down on this product 's page : '' Alright , so you want to get a good ( if somewhat `` basic '' ) distortion sound for less than $ 100 ? This is your deal . `` I strongly disagree . You can find MUCH BETTER distortions for $ 100 or less , even a few near or under the $ 40 mark the DS-1 is currently priced at.I 've played guitar for over 10 years . Like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the DS-1 . Afterall , everyone talks about them , they 're available at any given music store in the nation , you hear about all these famous musicians using them , plus a DS-1 is actually pretty cheap ! So I snapped one up just like everyone else . Come to find out that just because something is POPULAR , that does n't always mean its GOOD ( see : Nickelback , the Transformers movie franchise , the Kardashian family , etc ... ) .So I plugged it in and did n't really care for it . The distortion was harsh , thin , artificial sounding and always noisy . I tried it on both my amps ( My practic amp : a solid state Fender Frontman 25R , and my big amp , the B-52 AT100 , which is a 100w tube halfstack ) It was was not very diverse , and the basic sound was not very likeable to me . I 've read the Japanese made DS-1 's are better in sound than the newer , made in Taiwan models but , either way , the DS-1 is just not a great pedal in my mind.But , like many newer players , I did n't know any better at the time . Fast forward a few years and I 've bought and sold literally dozens of pedals . There is a whole world of great tones to be found out there if you keep your eyes open.So here are some pedals I currently own that I like much better than the DS-1 . All of them are great general purpose distortions , easy enough to find new and used in most guitar shops , and can , at the time of this writing , be bought brand new for $ 75 or less here on good ol ' Amazon.com , and are rugged enough to last for years : Boss DS-2 Turbo Distortion : Lest I catch any flames from people thinking I 'm a Boss hater ( I 'm certainly not , I loved the TU-3 , the ODB-3 , the MD-2 , and the XT-2 , among others ) I 'll start with the DS-1 's big brother . This pedal has a much nicer tone to it , not to mention 2 distinct distortion modes . The I setting is pretty much a higher quality DS-1 , the II setting is a brighter , richer tone . As the DS-1 completely overshadows the DS-2 in popularity , you can find DS-2 's all over ebay for very cheap prices . A very worthy pedal , unfortunately overlooked by many.Pro Co RAT2 : Great dirty distortion pedal . Probably my personal favorite . You 've heard this box used on literally hundreds if not thousands of songs in the last 30 years , its used by just a ridiculous amount of guitarists . Its a rich , full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy . I 've never heard a bad tone out of mine . Its great for getting a `` big amp '' kind of sound out of a small practice amp . Its also great for pushing a big amp with too much headroom into the overdriven sweet spot without having to crank the amp volume . A truly excellent pedal.EHX Little Big Muff : The Big Muff is another pedal you 've heard on hundreds of songs . Its kind of a fuzz , kind of a distortion , but definitely owns its own sonic territory . Very big , saturated and warm . Used heavily in the 70 's for classic rock tones , also in the 90 's and beyond for tons of grunge and garage . Used by everyone from Carlos Santana and David Gilmour to the Smashing Pumpkins , Dinosaur Jr. and Jack White . I personally reccomend the Little Big Muff , not only is it a touch creamier in tone than the recent NYC reissue , its smaller , uses a regular 9v adapter and its CHEAPER ! A great pedal.MXR Distortion + : The Distortion + is a great first distortion , and can usually be found pretty cheap . Whats nice about the Distortion + is that it sounds great on anything , and the lack of a tone knob helps keep it somewhat transparent , i.e . you can more easily hear the natural tone of your guitar and amp , it does n't cover over your equipments sound . Used by quite a few famous folks , including the Greatful Deads Jerry Garcia , Randy Rhoads ( Ozzy 's famous guitarist ) and Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols.Danelectro CM-1 Cool Cat Metal : Make sure you get the Cool Cat Metal , NOT the Metal II . That 's a fine pedal as well , but its definitely more of a traditional metal pedal . The Cool Cat Metal , or CM-1 , is actually a very very different pedal from most metal pedals . Basically , its a pre-amp that sits on the floor . It has a fully adjustable EQ with tons of volume and gain through the roof . So you can do anything from a clean boost ( with the gain at minimum there is virtually NO coloration to your tone ) to high gain metal stuff , with plenty of great overdrive and rock tones in between . It works well with any amp I 've tried it on , and you can find tons of great sounds . Its an unbelievably versatile pedal , and its even true bypass . The best part is , Danelectro seems to have made way too many of them , so you can easily find one used or even new for under $ 30 . A true hidden gem that 's actually CHEAPER than a DS-1.Joyo JF-03 Crunch Distortion : This little guy surprised me . Its supposedly a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box , and , if so , that must be one awesome pedal too . Its essentially a Marshall stack in a box , and boy does it ever succeed at that . Great crunch , tons of volume and gain , it really can make your practice amp sound like a big ragin ' stack ! It even sounded good going into my modeling amp ( very few pedals work well with my modeling amp , and this one even sounded better than the Marshall simualtion built in ) , and you can get a brand new one for $ 40 shipped , fantastic ! Speaking of Joyo , I 've had a few of their pedals as well as one or two from MOEN , another Chinese pedal maker , and I 'm honestly floored by how nice they sound given their shockingly low price tag ( especially theMOEN MO-FM Fuzz Moowhich honestly out Big Muffs every Big Muff I 've ever played through ) . So JOYO and MOEN , they both make a variety of great sounding fuzz , od , and dirt pedals , check them out ( and before anyone gets all up in arms about supporting a Chinese company , please keep in mind that NONE of the pedals listed in my review , DS-1 included , are made in America , let alone the western hemisphere ) .Hopefully these suggestions give you something to look for . Also , if you ca n't actually try a pedal out at the store , YouTube is great place to hear demos of what different pedals can do.I should also mention that if you try and love the DS-1 and it suits your needs , than more power to you . Tone is subjective , every pedal sounds different running through different guitars and amps , and just because I may share different opinions on something that you love , that 's okay . My main reason for posting this lengthy review is to give newer players some information . You have PLENTY of options for distortion pedals , the DS-1 is NOT the only thing out there that 's affordable . Find something you truly love and buy that . If its the DS-1 , one of the pedals I 've mentioned here , or anything else , the important part is that it sounds right to YOU .	-1
My first desk mic stand , and the adjuster part broke after only two days of use . It worked once when I originally set it , then kaput . It 's never worked properly since . I still use it but have to wrap electrical tape so that it 's at the right height . I would not purchase this product again .	-1
Sound nice , but very unreliable BX5a Deluxe.I own a pair of YAMAHA NS 10s and EVENT 20-20s , and they are all currently working without problems with over 10 years use.2 years ago I purchased a set of regular BX5a 's , and they lasted about 1 1/2 years , and then the faulty capacitors leaked.I just replaced them with the BX5a Deluxe model , and after only one week . one of the Internal amps will no longer power up.I need a pair of affordable AV shielded monitors that I can depend on , and these Cheap M-Audio Monitors are not it.I am back to using my 20-20 's with slight AV noise until I find a decent AV shielded monitor.M-Audio was a much better company before Avid took them over !	-1
As an amateur musician , I 'm always looking for ways to practice without chasing everyone out of the house with loud amplifiers and such . I thought this gadget would do the trick , but the quality of the sound and range of adjustment just did n't meet my expectations .	-1
Crikey , where to begin . Firstly , I hated the fact that they package two strings to a paper packet . Secondly , they mismarked one of the packets , so it appeared I had two & # 34 ; D & # 34 ; strings , instead of two & # 34 ; E & # 34 ; strings . Lastly , and certainly the least favorably , once tuned up , the strings sounded terrible ! They were tinny and clangy sounding . I 've never heard worse strings . Fortunately , I had bought a package of Ernie Ball Earthwood med . light , as well . I replaced the godawful Martins with the Ernie Ball 's and they were far , far better ! Shame on Martin for such a piss poor product . I 'll never buy their strings again .	-1
I have an Epiphone Les Paul and this stand does not hold it at all . The holders are too far apart to keep the guitar from sliding through onto the floor . Maybe it 's a decent stand for an acoustic or a fatter electric . But given that Les Paul is a pretty popular model of guitar , this should not be sold as an electric guitar stand . I 'm rating it for what it is sold as , and for that , it gets 1 star , and only because since there is no zero .	-1
should have paid a little more and i guess im spoiled with 2nd day ... these have been ordered for a couple of weeks ... you seem to wait forever to save a few bucks ... i odered for some buddies and hear about it every day ... hope they work when they do finally arrive..good luck	-1
It 's simple , basic , but I do n't think it does that good of a job . This is because it does n't really humidify that much and does n't extend very far into the guitar .	-1
I bought this with the idea I was getting a pedal that would give me usable Marshall amp sounds . After trying for a couple of hours , I find that it wo n't do that . I guess my combination of guitar and amplifier was n't meant to be used with this pedal . The guy who mentioned in the reviews about the sound getting thinner as you turn up the voice control , he was spot on about that ( very annoying effect ) . Nothing but praise goes to the supplier ( KDM Distributors ) . They did a fine job getting the pedal to me across the country . But the pedal itself , not for me .	-1
I ordered one of these ( from MF ) and had to send it back because it was damaged and the latches did n't all work . Even in perfect condition it 's still a subpar case . But the one I got had two ripped corners on the lid , and from those rips it 's easy to see that the edge of the lid is just very thin cardboard all around , and the black outside covering provides little protection to keep that cardboard from tearing . As for the latches ( buckles ) , there are three of them and on the one I had only one worked to keep the case closed . The other two latched , but they rattled and provided no tension at all to help keep the lid shut.Disregarding those flaws it 's still obvious that it 's not a good case . The hinges look like they could fall apart or come off at any moment , the handle is not comfortable to hold , and the whole thing bends in a way that makes you wonder if you would be better off with a gig bag . It also wo n't stand evenly on end ( if that 's important to you ) .On the positive side it 's light , it does fit a Telecaster ok , and the inside is a decent plush lining with a small storage compartment . But do yourself a favor and spend another $ 25 and get something better . I have a Musician 's Gear dreadnought case and this does n't compare to that one at all .	-1
garbage if you like it ... then buy it.this is NOT how the world of music sounds.TOO MUCH BASS and other garbage ... are you guys really HEARING anything ? world has gone bass crazy since about 1981 ... more and more..we lost analog , we lost quality thanks tocompression and mp3 , and now to put morecrap into our ears , they give you ONEfrequency ... bass ONLY , take it or leave it.will go find REal headphones , thanks.kb	-1
Let me first start off with the sizing . When they say `` Fits Soundholes from 33.75 '' - 35 '' '' , they really mean it.You are going to have a hard time trying to fit it even if it is 1/16 '' smaller than the specifications.I know I did . My friend 's Oscar Schmidt 3/4 sized guitar was just that much smaller and it did not fit well . The edges did not `` catch '' completely and it looks terrible.My classical guitar had a similarly sized soundhole but because of the much wider fretboard at the edge of the soundhole , it did not fit at all . You could try cutting the edges off the Oport at the fretboard.The main issue is the sound.Yes , it does make the sound fuller when you are strumming , slightly but enough to tell.However , it does so at the expense of the sustain and harmonic overtunes.Fingerpicking just does not sound as nice as before , even though the guitar is noticeably better on the bass notes.For me , that does not justify it.A simple bone saddle does way better than this and it cost less.Another thing I found out was what was Amazon does to stuff others return - they resell as brand new if it looks brand new.The packaging on mine came slightly torn and looked as if it had been opened . Does it matter ? In practical terms , no , not for this sort of item.I guess that is how Amazon keeps their prices low yet with good customer service and return policies .	-1
I have a real problem with these patch cables . I got them as a christmas gift but they do n't stay in my pedals ' input jacks without causing problems and having to push them in on occasion . Most problematic is the connection between my EHX memory boy and digital memory man ... never had problems with any other cables here , but these refuse to stay put without having to constantly adjust .	-1
Cheap crappy strap . It 's too stiff , not comfortable at all . I regret purchasing this ... Save your money , go hunt for a Coach strap or something similar . They are expensive but worth it .	-1
They only fit if you have enough room in your strap button , if not they will just pop right out . I threw mine away .	-1
I sometimes see reviews as redundant and unnecessary and I see a lot of positive reviews for this guitar strap , but I do n't know why . Maybe other people do n't really care what kind of strap they have or maybe they just have never had a good strap before . It was n't too hard to get on and only took a couple of seconds , but once I got it on it was stiff and felt odd . It was very uncomfortable around my neck and I took it off my guitar in a matter of matters . I would honestly recommend spending a few extra dollars on a more expensive and more comfortable strap . Unless you 're just going for something that is inexpensive , does the job , and is n't designed for comfort .	-1
straight out of the box this product reeked cheap . No directions inside or on the box . I messed with it for about 5 minutes . I would not trust it with a heavy or expensive mic . I read the description but it did not say cheap . Live and learn .	-1
I really wanted this to be a great product . The screws strip out too easily . Basically , if you put a microphone in it , and ever have to use it for a microphone , it is going to strip out . I had two of them and was hoping that the first one was a lemon . Nope . Even the pop filter fell off . I LOVE the design , but they need to make them strong enough to handle the weight of a microphone and strong enough to handle regular studio usage ... ex : adjusting the position of the mic , picking up a mic stand and moving it , etc . Otherwise , do n't have an adjustable tilt option . Just make it one solid piece . I 'm tempted to try to fix it with Gorilla Glue because I do love the design . It 's just not strong enough . Not that it 's a surprise though . Not much of anything is worth the money these days . It 's a damn chore to return every friggin ' purchase these days that they do n't really have to care about actually testing products . Why should they ? They already have your money . I feel like I should get paid for testing their products and the time spent un-boxing and packing things back up . Besides , what are they going to do ? Replace it with another broke a $ $ product ? Better yet , refund my money for the product I paid - minus shipping ? ? ? ? That does n't include the time I spent trying to prevent you from buying one and testing their damn product in the first place . I want a refund , plus an hourly wage . Whatever , do n't buy one . Companies that do n't test their products do n't deserve your business . What would make me happy , is for one of these companies that make these products to answer the question ( s ) : Did you test this product ? How did you test it ? What were your results ? Is it ready to be sold to the public with confidence ? Nope	-1

This arrived and when I tried to use it , it turned out that the male threads were some oddball metric size that does NOT fit any standard adapter.Instead , these theads stripped the fitting on my mike clip , so now I have to go somewhere else and buy a new gooseneck AND a clip.This is such a standard item , that there is no excuse for making it with non-standard threads , and NO excuse at all for advertising it as standard 5/8ths ...	-1

I purchased this as an extra CV controller for a Digitech Control 2 . When I got it , I tried it out as a volume pedal just for kicks and YES it does suck the tone right out of the signal . As far as a CV controler ? it sucks at that too ! Why ? it squeaks as you move it ( after 5 minutes use , right out of the box ) . Behringer is a joke and gives German engineering a bad name ( although only 'conceived ' in Germany ) .It 's a direct copy of the Yamaha FC9 and so I am about to purchase one of those and see how it compares . I 'm betting the extra 45 dollars will be well worth it.Also , you may say `` who cares if it squeaks a little '' ? well I do when I am controlling volume swells or a 'wah ' effect at low volume in the studio ! Good luck if you buy it .	-1
The adjustment screw for the boom is a piece of crap , a really small set screw that strips out almost immediately . Replace that with something stronger and this would be a great stand . They are light weight and if all you need is mic support in a fixed setting , good enuf okay I guess . But after transporting and reset , I found them to be junk .	-1

My issue with the Pedaltrain 2 is the accommodation of a power supply . I have a Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus.The documentation that comes with this pedalboard specifically states that this power supply mounts under the board , and it even includes mounting brackets that fit this power supply . However , if you actually try to mount it to the underside of the board as suggested , you 're in for an unpleasant surprise.First of all , regarding the two circular holes on the front of the board . The fitment to the power supply is there ... sort of . There 's no way to align them perfectly because the holes on the pedaltrain 2 are slightly too close together . I was n't worried about this , since I doubt I 'll ever chain them and only have access to 1 outlet.The second issue is , the allegedly self-tapping screws that come with the mounting kit strip as though they were made of butter . Once you 've got them in ( or attempted to do so ) , they 're never coming out . You 'll probably have to break them . It 's a shame to have cut corners on something so inexpensive.The main issue I have with this board relating to my Voodoo Lab power supply is this . Once you get the power supply mounted properly on the underside of the board ( it can only go one place ) , you begin to plug in your pedals and you discover that the cables supplied with the power supply do n't fit the mounting location on this board . You ca n't plug them in because there 's not enough clearance between the frame of the pedalboard and the sockets the cables plug in to.I really only bought this pedalboard because of the supposed perfect compatibility with the Voodoo Lab power supply I own , but given that it does n't fit like it 's supposed to , I wish I could return this board - except I ca n't , because it now has holes drilled in it . ( You have to drill the board to mount the power supply underneath it . ) Basically , I paid $ 100 for a plain flat sheet metal metal rectangle and a couple rolls of velcro . Needless to say , I 'm not very pleased .	-1
This was my first foray into home recording and it comes with Audacityfor free . Free is free , and you get what you pay for in terms of something that will not produce high qualty musical reproduction . The interface is noisy , and it requred a lot of tweaking after the fact to get a reasonable sound without distorion and humms etc . Sent it back after one day .	-1
I purchased this amp locally and initially , I thought it was pretty cool as it was my first modeling amp ; lots of potential for a limitless variety of sounds . This was my first Fender amp as well.The presets were neat and all , but when I played around with some of the `` standard '' models ( just the amp model , no effects ) just to see how it 's clean sound was , the amp just hissed as if I had the volume cranked with a distortion pedal engaged at max . The master volume was at 2 and no effects were turned on ... I 've never heard a clean channel with so much noise behind it , even when there was no guitar plugged in ... All I could hear while playing was the underlying hiss coming through the notes ; very distracting and it drove me nuts ! This is n't a ground loop issue ( my other amps sound just fine at bedroom volumes and beyond ) , it 's clearly a defect with this product . Dirty pre-sets with lots of gain and extra volume sound even worse , again , even when nothing is plugged in and at low master volume . You 'd think I was running a few super high gain stomp boxes with a red hot single coil , but NOTHING was plugged in and all I get is staticy-hiss at LOW LEVELS . WTF ? The next issue is the weird `` fizz '' sound , that was especially noticeable on the low e. After striking a string , instead of a clean note , there 's a weird fizzy digital artifact like sound that `` surrounds '' the note , and fades as the string stops moving . It almost sounds like cymbals crashing on a poorly authored MP3 file at a low bit rate and frequency . Whole chords break down and decay in this fizzy envelope and really makes this thing unplayable.The weird thing is , neither one of these problems arose with head phones plugged in , or when this was connected to my computed via either USB or the line in ... but I 'm not going to be stuck playing a 100 watt amp through my PC or cans . I got the III instead of the II because of the power behind it and the touted 12 '' Celestion speaker.Read the many reviews online or forum posts on many of the guitar/amp related websites ( there 's a 65 page forum post on the Fender support site that is quite interesting ) and you 'll find that these amps are having issues . Apparently , the Mustang I and II do n't have these issues , and the firmware update did NOTHING to correct my amp . Is this a hardware issue , software issue , speaker issue ? There is speculation that the LCD screen ( which is not present on the I or II ) may be causing problems , but no one seems to know for sure and Fender does n't seem to care ... Definitely try this before you buy it . You may get an amp that does n't have these problems , you may not notice the sounds or you may not even care ; let your ears tell you what sounds good.This amp has a lot of potential for great sounds , and it would have been nice to have faithful modeling of some great vintage amps , but in my opinion , technical issues have made this amp sound like complete garbage . I am disappointed that Fender has n't yet correct what ever is wrong ( some folks claim that Fender reps say that know what is wrong , but I 'm not taking that as a fact ... ) , but they have acknowledged that there is `` something '' wrong.Whatever ... I took this back after a few days of playing with it , trying to eliminate the junk sounds without success ( the built-in noise gate helps a little , but sucks tone ) and I picked up a 100 watt Marshall instead . Guess what ? The clean channel has ZERO hum or buzz , even when cranked . How about that ? Even when I engage a dirt box on one of the dirty channels , there is minimal noise.I 'll knock Fender for NOT correcting this issue regardless of what it is and what caused it , but they do have some other nice amps that I 'd like to try . But before I buy another Fender amp , I 'll take it for a test drive and I suggest you do the same before picking up one of these turds .	-1
It is inexpensive but is difficult to use anywhere with other noise..I used it for several years but it is only a backup now.. Nice part is that you can calibrate the tuning , although probably would not be used by most musicians.. Other than that I think money would be better spent on a headstock type tuner.. I would not recommend it .	-1
I 've had it for about a month now and it has n't fallen apart so I guess that 's a plus , but the main issue with this rackmount is that whatever automated machine they used to drill the screw holes is definitely defective , as a large majority of the holes are slightly deformed and will not take in the provided screws and are therefore USELESS . Thanks to this problem I am only able to use TWO slots out of TWELVE . It 's definitely very frustrating and although the price is tempting , stay away from this .	-1
Second one I bought . Lousy build quality and only lasted 3 months . Went through two of these before I learned my lesson . Do n't waste your money on this junk . I love Planet Waves stuff normally , but these are junk .	-1
Well this cable certainly did n't last long as the title says 8 weeks . Bought a new Fender Mustang2 v2 amp a week and a half ago . Last night amp would turn on but was n't putting out any sound from the guitar . Messed around a bit and it started to work . Today same thing and it 's obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp . Thought I had a bad jack in my new amp and was n't very happy . Got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either . At least my new amp is working and I only have to replace a $ 12 cord.Maybe I 'm just unlucky and got a bad one and if I bought it at a local store I 'd return it . Not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund . Will just move on to another company 's cord .	-1

While the product came as described , the build quality felt a little lacking . On the website it mentioned that it accepts the Shure KSM32 threading but it does not , so if you 're threading matches the KSM32 , look elsewhere .	-1
Both of the stands had parts that had fallen out , or were missing all together . When the pamphlet that comes with them states that they are fully assembled and guaranteed to be free of defects , this is a major concern . It may be that I got a bad box that got missed by quality control , but it does make me suspicious of Pyle products .	-1
I was not happy with the sound of these strings . The EAD steel wound strings sound dull and the nylon GBE strings sound tinny . For an extra $ 2 I bought the D'Addario EJ45 Pro Arte and got a much , much higher quality sound out of my 40 yr old Yamaha G-60 . Spend the extra $ 2 its well worth it .	-1
Could be a fluke , but my unit was defective straight out of the box . Plugged it into the Macbook Pro , fired up GarageBand and right away it 's MIDI connectivity was intermittent . Then it had some stuck notes . Then it stopped being recognized at all . It still got power from the USB bus , but no MIDI , no sound . The jack was visibly wiggly , too.So , you 're mileage may vary , but mine obviously had a defective USB port on the back . Rather than bust it open and get soldering iron , I returned it and bought an M-Audio Oxygen 25 for $ 20 more .	-1
This `` would '' be a great digital reverb but for the fact that the more you turn the level up on the reverb intensity , it simultaneously fades the initial attach of the strum , pluck or riff rendering the reverb relatively worthless if you 'want a lot of reverb '' . What the hell was Behringer thinking ? ? ?	-1
It does not stick on to the guitar very well . Trying some of the other reviews as to ways to get it to stick worked but I now have a small circle in the finish of my Martin . I made mistake of attaching so wife could play Rocksmith and now wish I had used cheaper guitar or better yet , bought a better pickup .	-1
Sounded good . Warmer sounding than stock tubes in my ac15 . I rocked all night and loved the sound . Next day i turned it on , my amp was crackling out and wiping out the signal i checked the tubes and one of them was making violent purple flashes before the signal burnt out . I then noticed that one of my fuses blew out as well . I changed out the fuse and checked again and the tube was still doing the same thing so i just swapped the tubes back for atock . Id like to see a real set of jjs , im sure one of them was a dud .	-1
Installed these on my Schecter C-1 Hellraiser . I had very high hopes for these , but as with any new over-hyped technology , they failed to impress me . The only good thing I have to say is the tone is good . But realistically it is no where near a drastic difference to regular strings . You would barely be able to hear the difference in a side by side comparison . So now that I have wasted almost double the price on these it gets worse . They are not silky smooth feeling as advertised . If anything they feel worse than regular strings . Last but not least : they are bad for frets . Just like stainless strings ; harder metal against nickel frets is going to wear them out real quick . I do n't know about anyone else but I do n't want to have my guitar re-fretted every 2 years.For the very miniscule difference in tone they are not worth the extra money or equipment wear and tear .	-1
I have no idea what happened or if anyone else had this problem , but I got literally 8 plug-ins , and not the part where you can plug in an existing cable to make this into a chain . It 's like I got an extension cord and male outlets on both ends . Soooo it 's pretty much useless to me . I guess if you get one of those power blocks with 9v outlets on them , I guess you could plug this into it but I really see no point . I would 've shipped it back I lost the packaging and just wrote it off as loss . I think I payed like $ 8 for it so whatever . I would recommend going to an actual music store so you can physically see both the male ends and the female end .	-1
I have checked this amp out twice , once with an orange ppc112 and once with the 8 & # 34 ; version , with both a Strat and a Les Paul , and I am very disappointed in this amp.Now admittedly , with the high output buckers on the les paul the pre-amp breaks up nicely and the tone is really sweet with the gain on 5-7 , however the bottom line is that there is simply not enough clean headroom in this amp to produce any worthwhile volume with clean or mild crunch tones.So , without any volume with clean tones this amp becomes a one trick pony and hence so very very disappointing ... Bottom line : unless you want full on distortion 100 % of the time , you are better off with a clean amp and distortion pedal than this gutless amp ... . if you are committed to Orange ( and boy do they make some stunning amps ) go check out the dark terror ...	-1
I was dissapointed to find out that you can only use one of theeffects at a time , good though they were . Too expensive foronly one effect at a time . Returned it .	-1
The sheets seem to work fine to polish the frets but the template is cut from the cardboard box which obviously is n't going to last long . Also , trying to hold the cardboard on the neck is a pain and my finger is killing.I 'm going to go buy a fret eraser and be done with it .	-1
Bought this a while back just got around to installing it on my mexi strat . Does n't fit perfect . Kinda bummed but oh well	-1
Manufacturer 's website claimed that this case would fit a Les Paul style guitar . I have an ESP Eclipse . Not even close . ChromaCast products are great . They need to fix the info on their web page . I 'm not a fan of shaped Les Paul cases . Too bad .	-1
To heavy ... .it does n't stay where you need it . slips down becuase of wieght.. get something else or larger strap to dispers wieght of the guitar ...	-1
Perhaps it may do something of worth for you but if you have one of the finer made guitars this will probably do more to subtract than add to the sound . Be advised that I did not use it in front of a microphone where perhaps the shape of this internal plastic cone might do something you like in directing the sound to a mike . As strictly an issue of natural acoustics , I found it deflected sound in a way that seemed to decrease my guitar 's output and resonance . I have an Aria AD-80 which is a very well-made Chinese attempt at cloning a Martin D-42 . It can not compete with the real Martin but for the money I paid it was a great buy and it is known as a `` sound canon '' for it 's great natural volume . Adding the O-Port deadened the lows . It just did n't provide any plus at all anywhere else . It is however pretty inexpensive so if you 're a nut for nuance and you want to try it for yourself it 's not going to break your bank . But again , if you have one of the better makes of guitar where a real person `` voiced it '' in his or her manufacturing process , this plastic gizmo will likely subtract from that and not add anything . I 'm an acoustic nut and I 'd love to have a sound port in the side of my guitar to hear everything that goes on inside that box . The O-port seemed to `` corral '' the sound and shoot it out that plastic horn not allowing me to hear some of the resonance of the sound bouncing back off the back and sides below the sound hole . Sorry to be a crab about it -- I like Planet Waves stuff and they were very good to me personally in the `` Humidipak '' recall a few years back . But this product was a waste to me .	-1
This tuner works fine for the flute and clarinet however for things that use the input jack it does n't really work . As soon as I insert any cord into the jack it automaticly goes to a very low B flat and stays there ... Even if the guitar and bass are not on the other end . At first I thought it was my cord however after four cords doing this , I also tried other tuners with the same cords and they worked fine . So again works good on the sound input but poorly with cord input .	-1
I know many people love the design , but I find it much too frustrating . You have to be very careful putting it on the fret correctly , then snap it in , then turn and turn the screw , oops do n't let it snap off again and fall off while trying to turn the screw . Then you have to go through the whole routine again to take it off and move it to another fret and put it on again . What a farce . This is the worst capo I 've owned , and I 've tried nearly every brand and type . Yeah , I 've had people show me how to do it right , and I know to do it right . It 's just wrong to have to spend so much time slipping it on , snapping it , screwing it in , screwing it off , having it fall off , forget it , it 's garbage to me . Also , while I 'm getting my callouses worked out playing for two hours every day , the last thing I want is to pinch my fingers against metal trying to turn a screw . It 's actually slightly painful to the fingers ( momentarily , but why have to deal with that ? ? ) to work with . This design seems like it was a non guitar player who came up with it . The only good thing I can say about it is looks durable.No thanks .	-1
DOWNGRADE TO 1-O STAR AFTER RETURNING IT BACK TO BROOKMAYS , THE SELLER : I am really disappointed by the seller , BrookMays ' , ignorant responses to my return of the defective Cherbub Guitar Pickup , which picks up unwanted noise by the wire 's own movements and the high frequency of feedback that other pickup wo n't have the same issue . After two weeks of the returned item was delivered , I did n't hear anything from the seller regarding the return , so I emailed to the seller to see if we can settle it asap . Too bad , four days after the email had been sent , I only got the email of telling me the case # of the message I sent without any further response to my refund . until my patience is gone to deal with this hassle , and I do n't think it 's worth to waste more time on it , despite the fact of wasting the time and money I spent on this useless pickup and the shipping costs . Therefore , yesterday , I emailed my last contact to the seller regarding the refund of the purchase and gon na report this to AMAZON about the bad after-sale service I ever have before if I still have n't heard from the seller shorty.Today , I finally received the seller 's response to my refund , the seller denies the issues of the pickup and claims , `` it was not defective . All pickups are going to get unwanted noise if you move the guitar . The feedback can be to to many other issues . I have issued the refund of $ 7.04 . '' Obviously , the reply is unconvincing ; although the feedback can be raised from varies issues , i have tried with another pickup to the same directions and setups , but it does n't have such problems at all . The fact is NOT ALL pickups get UNWANTED noise although I did n't try many pickups . Cherub Guitar Pickup does n't work as the product description to pickup the original tones of the instrument regardless the surrounding noises . Moreover , the unwanted loud noise from its wire movements is really annoying , and there 's no way to stop the wire movements while strumming . Indeed , I wo n't use it , and I do n't want it to sit at my house as a useless property , so returning back to the seller may help to improve the issues it has . However , the hassles I got from the seller is totally unexpected and it 's NOT worth at all.By the way , I 'm also unhappy about the refund of & 7.04 , I bought it for $ 8.79 along with AMAZON Free Shipping of the purchase of $ 25 or more . To me , it is not the money of $ 1.75 , but it 's not fair to the buyer , who does n't get the right service and quality from the purchase but only wastes the times and money on this matter . So if you really need a pickup for your instrument , I highly recommend you to spend few more dollars to get a much better and reliable one . Do n't make the same mistake as I did to try this one because of the cheap price , in turn , you may get more hassles than you expect on such cheap merchandise . I do n't want that happens to anyone else , so I decided to tell you what I went through to keep you from the possible hassles before betting on it.2 STARS FOR THE 1ST REVIEW AFTER USING IT TWICE : I like the clip-on design , which is easy to use , so it is worth 2 stars ; however , it does n't work well clipping on small soundholed string instruments like ukes and kid size guitars because it touches the strings . Besides that , it also picks up loudly through the wire 's own movements , not as the description `` regardless the surrounding noises . '' I have distressed from those unwanted loud noises . One more thing that it somehow produces much higher feedback to the mini amp that I use , and I have to turn the volume as low as possible to prevent the high frequency of feedback . However , when I switch to another pickup with the same setup on mini amp and acoustic guitars or uke . the amp does n't have any feedback even turning it to almost the highest volume , and the other pickup does n't have the unwanted noise from its own movement either . I do n't know whether is my lack of luck or the poor pickup I got ... I bought it because its cheap price ( less than $ 9 ) & clip-on design , but , I ca n't accept the noises and I have to waste my shipping cost to return it back to the seller . So , if you want to give it a try , you may bear in mind that the seller , BrookMays , does n't take any responsibility for the shipments even the item does n't work properly as claimed description . Good Luck then !	-1
I really like Epiphone products . They are well-made , easy to play guitars . I also purchased an Ep Les Paul Special 2 Ebony from Amazon a while back . But , I received this Uke defective . I expected when I plugged it in it would play through an amplifier but I could n't here anything at all . Totally dead . There are no volume controls but it was like the volume was turned all the way down . I 'm disappointed because I expect Gibson to test each guitar before it leaves the factory . I actually bought this guitar for a friend and was very embarrassed when I got over to his house and it did n't work in front of him . I just requested a return/exchange from Amazon . If the next one works ok I may buy a second one for me . I seem to have bad luck with electric-acoustic guitars when purchased through Amazon . I had to send back my Dean 12 string elec-acoust to Amazon too because of an intermittent sound problem . I do want to state that this is a beautiful Uke with nice feeling nylon strings , fine wood high polished surface , high quality tuners and plays loud acoustically . The actual guitar looks even BETTER in person than in the picture . If this Uke was working 100 % I would have given it a 4 or 5 .	-1
Not very substantial . It began to tear on my guitar strings . I was hoping for something that would hold up to more uses .	-1
I have other harmonica 's but thought I 'd like a set of blues harps . I thought that if it 's made by Hohner , it must be fairly good . Wow , was I wrong . Too hard to push notes through them . I would n't recommend these to anyone .	-1
This thing is crap right out of the box it had holes in the stitching and all the pockets were sown on crooked . What can you expect for $ 20 tho . This was a temporary solution I do n't recommend this for long term use it will probably fall apart .	-1
They have no grip at all they brake and ware out in a hour or so of hard playing there just junk for newbie that don ` t know any beter but hey what do you expect they are made by D Addario get some real picks like Dunlop Tortex	-1
Soooo bummed . I simply love the sound on these cans , but the speakers are just too dang close to the surface ( not deep enough in the cups ) and press down hard on my ears . The max time I can wear them is like an hour , and then I ca n't wear them for a day or so due to residual pain . I guess if they used thicker pads to deepen the cups , that might help . Also , on most of my other phones , the speaker areas have fairly flat surfaces , while this one has the speakers jutting out of the cups and are covered by just one thin nylon sheet . So it 's kind of like double trouble . However , these really do have great sound ( especially the tight bass clarity ) . If it were n't for the discomfort factor , I would be using them all the time . As of now , I hardly use them at all . In fact , when I first tested these out , I was ready to hop on the computer and order a couple more . But I 'm glad I waited to really give them a more prolonged test . Of course , we are all of varying shapes and sizes , ha ha , so they might work for you where they do n't for me . If so , you 've got a bargain on some great cans . If not , ouch . Cheers !	-1
Well ... it 's not really too expensive , but it give you basically the same sound no matter how you set it . Even the crunch button is just a louder sound ? Not a very good value unless you try it out first and this is exactly the sound you 're looking for . Guess that 's why it 's so cheap .	-1
I am a tone freak . I bought this pedal a while back under the impression that it would sound equal to a big muff . At the time i had never owned a big muff . I thought the sound it produced was big muff sound . I later took it to my friends house and matched settings with a real big muff . The difference was huge . The big muff sounded fuller where the little one sounded like you just took the sound and trapped it in a little box . I later bought a big muff and its been one of my go to pedals for at least three years of gigging . I am currently loving it still but i am curious about the nano big muff because i am looking to clear out space on my board but i will probably not use it if it sounds anything less than the real deal . I would only use the little big muff if my concerns for sound were out shined by the need to minimize board space	-1
I have played on D'addario Before , actually the first string I started out on.Super light 's are ok , but can wear out real fast , So , It 's importent not to put to much stess on them ... ..espescially if You do alot of tricks , pinched hormonic 's vibrato 's , extreme bend 's , etc they will break . Any skilled guitarist know 's to use extream caution when tuning ... .any strings , I did try extra light ( while they do soud nice , and have a nice feel to them ) I would not recamend these for beginer 's , cause beginer 's tend to press hard , when they first stat out.Personally , I do n't like D'addario 's at all , I find the tone to bright .	-1
These cables are excellent quality cables , however , if you are trying to patch your pedals together in a closely spaced setup , these cables are rather bulky and stiff.The large size of the right angle connectors requires you to space your pedals out more than you might prefer , especially compared to some of the other pedal patch cables that are available from companies such as Hosa .	-1
As I 've heard with the Pyle Pro amps , I received mine today , and it was defective . Only one channel worked , and it definitely looked like it took a beating before it arrived at my doorstep . The packaging was very good though , so I 'm thinking this looks like a refurb/used , and they listed it as new . Already printed the return shipping label , and it will head back to the Amazon warehouse on Monday ...	-1
I bought this as a cheap way to amplify my acoustic . Learned my lesson . Should of just forked over the money for an a/e . I have a Yamaha F335 I really like . I say someone take a piezo transducer to amplify his guitar so I thought I 'd try it . I first picked up a transducer for about $ 3 and experimented . I like it , sounded good then I saw this from Axl and I thought I 'd try it . Installing it was n't bad except I bought a set of drill bits I did n't need for $ 10 . So I got it installed and plugged it in and from the start the sound was alright . I just wanted it for playing around at home so I did n't need real great sound quality . But sound was ok except it picks up every bang and knock especially my planet waves I think quick connect strap connector . My other complaint is I could n't turn it up too loud without the feedback screeching . Overall product quality is good . Setup was ok. Price was good . Sound in my opinion needs some tweaking .	-1
With drum pads , I basically either get 0 velocity , or max . And I have to really hammer on them to trigger . Hurts after a while.Likes : + Size+ Assignable knobs.+ Works good w/ Ableton LiveDislikes : - Drum pads ! Keys are pretty cheesy but workable and expected for this price and size.I 'm looking to upgrade after a month.. Want better drum pads . : -/	-1
I have a 1953 telecaster body and after installing the screw to the pickup they were to long for the body . I had to trim them down	-1
50+ years playingmy pedal is unuseablethe lower strings are all mush at any gain or eq settingread all the good reviews and watched all the videosmine sounds nothing like themmaybe defectivei also own the joyo british and joyo crunch and they are flawless	-1
The material used is fine . The looks are fine . The length is horrible . This is too short for most adults that play guitar . It felt like I was holding my guitar around my neck instead of off my shoulders . I attached it by the longest way possible and it was well short of what I could use . To me this was a worthless purchase . I just tucked it into a drawer and it will sit there and not be used again .	-1
This review is on the seller Yorozuya Yokoshima , not the product . These people posted what seemed like a good price ( not ridiculously low ) on the Us Dream pedal . It was to be shipped from Japan . They then decided the price was an error and canelled my order . This kind of crap makes me wan na stop shopping on Amazon.com because the item was less than $ 4.00 under the next best posted price and these 3rd party sellers Yorozuya Yokoshima were afraid they would n't make a killing on the item . I am thoroughly disgusted with this sort of behavior . I lost a lot of faith in the whole process of buying online over this incident .	-1
..it works.But expect some flaws.First , finding a driver to use was a pain.It does n't come with a software disc , so look on Behringer 's support site for driver download.Whatever driver you do use it kills all other audio , you ca n't run any other media player and get sound.My advice is unless you have a dedicated PC or laptop for using this ... get something else .	-1
I gave it two stars because the expression pedal stopped working after the second day , and visually it 's hard to read because the lettering is so small . Also there are many function for one knob to have , a little confusion for me . The sounds are great and the recording aspect of it is nice , but not something that is best for my needs.I am looking into a Boss ME-25 instead ,	-1
This product is bad quality because the noise it makes . It increases the volume so much that it is better not to use it at all . I 'm going to sell this product . I did n't like it .	-1
I do n't like the feel or sound of these strings . I bought both the .010 and the .011 and they both hurt my fingers and sound like tin foil . I would not buy these again	-1
I do n't know how this will work with other MIDI instruments but I tried it with the Roland TD9 drums and although it does transmit the data , the drum map is totally off . The respective triggers ( hihat , hihat pedal , etc ) are translated into all sorts of wrong information and while you can manually compensate for some of it on the PC end of it , it was just a freaking hassle . I needed this to be more flexible and able to record directly to my Notebook ( which does n't have a MIDI input ) but I gave up in the end and went with my desktop PC and its MIDI interface .	-1
This capo is n't quite wide enough for my regular steel string acoustic guitar . If I position it just so it will work as long as I do n't bump it or a string will pop out of one side .	-1
Received it in time , standard blister packaging but the cable stopped working after 45 days . Since I was out of 30 days return time , sent an email to the manufacturer but no response till today .	-1
I ordered this from the Amazon warehouse as a refurbished item . It was properly packaged but the base was broken and poorly glued together . The glue did n't hold so the clamping base separated from the stem that allows the meter to swivel . This was unfixable so I sent it back for a refund . Warehouse deals are not such good deals .	-1
In an attempt to see what 's new in the pick industry , I decided to dive in and give these a go . They are way too flimsy if , like me , you use a heavier pick . I have always used Dunlop Tortex greens and these Davas just ca n't compete . Not only were they too flimsy , but when I played with any aggression ( heavy rock-based material ) , the picks would fly out of my hands . This was a huge disappointment .	-1
SummaryAcoustic sounds & # 34 ; ok & # 34 ; , but noisy in weird ways . I returned it . Price seems high for what it is and vs. alternatives in the marketplace.Pros- Boss case is metal , mechanical design is durable- standard 9V power , and the power jack is on the back where it belongs.- variety of acoustic sounds possible . ( personally , I only thought 1 of them sounded realistic at all though ) Cons- fizzy noise integrated with notes played ( or chords ) - generally kind of noisy in the pedal chain- While I have several Boss pedals , I think they always make the knobs too small and the font/print too small . I prefer pedals with larger and fewer knobs that can be tweaked with your toe if needed while playing.Details : The basic concept is good . I had an AC-2 ( prior model ) and sold it because it had a noise problem where there was a fizzy noise when you play a note . It was n't in between the notes or when not playing , it was integrated with the sound of every note you played ( or chord ) and you could not filter it . It was also just noisy in the pedal chain . Adjusting your guitar volume down for higher gain pickups helps some . However , I sold that model because I did n't want the pedal in the chain with everything else and I was n't happy with the sound . At the time , the AC-2 's were selling for about $ 85 new . Boss since redesigned AND raised the price significantly on the AC-3.I bought the AC-3 hoping they had improved the issues of the AC-2 -- and they did , a little . But not enough to keep it . I returned it after a week because it still has the same basic issues , just not as pronounced . I think the AC-3 could work for gigging , but there are other choices that sound as good for $ 25 instead of $ 130 to $ 150 ( with tax and/or shipping ) so to me , the boss pedal is overpriced and not that great.I opted for a Behringer acoustic modeller instead . They make two -- a & # 34 ; 300 & # 34 ; and a & # 34 ; 400 & # 34 ; . The 400 has reverb on the pedal . I opted for the 300 and got it for $ 25 . I expect the durability will be lower on the Behringer than the Boss as it has a plastic case . However , this is an effect I pull out just once in a while and since I can buy 4 or 5 or 6 Behringers for the price of a Boss ... .if it breaks ... I 'll just buy another.I also have a Boss GT-100 multi-effects unit . You can get the same or similar acoustic modelling sounds out of that , out of the Behringer or out of the Boss AC-3 . The least cost effective of those choices is the AC-3 - and it has noise issues the other two do n't have.I 'm not saying its a bad pedal , I 'm just saying it was n't the best choice for me when considering the cost , the sounds , and my usage model . If they would fix the noise issues , I might have even kept it . I did opt to keep the Behringer for those times I 'm using a discrete pedal board and want an acoustic model effect . This Boss pedal just did n't work that well for me .	-1
This is a hit-or-miss product . For me it fell short but for others it seems to work very well . It 's not a total loss since I can reuse the endpin jack with the soundhole solution I ended up with . It was cheap enough that it was worth taking a chance on .	-1
CRAP these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy Ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of Ernies I did n't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right ... ... ... ... ... ... ..never again	-1
The plastic piece that screws the wire into the end was made of VERY thin plastic , and cracked in two within a week of light use . I guess I can redo it with electrical tape to make it work , but I have many Whirlwind cables that have lasted me 15+ years . I expected more from this manufacturer , but I guess the quality is not the same as it used to be .	-1
Bought these to try them out the medium gauge and brand . Mediums too hard on my thin fingers and will stick to light and extra light gauges . The strings were hard to slide , un-slippery , and changing barr chords made so much squeaks I did n't like . Tone is warm but too mellow for my tastes . G-string snapped 2 days later at the windings with the string wounds pried right off : \	-1
Im starting a podcast . I blindly lept to buy the blue yeti . I can understand why one person with a youtube channel would love this . Great for voice overs . In sound proof studios . The sound quality was good but it picked up WAY TO MUCH ROOM NOISE . The ability to select the 4 recording modes is great . If youll use it . I would not reccomend recording 2 people at once on this . However recording a choir or something would work . But I will never do that and neither will you . This microphone only has a usb port . Not XLR . So no hope of expanding . If you ever want to host a podcast with 2 people you need to throw this away and get a mixer and 2 new microphones.Or you can do what I did and get 2 Audio Technica ATR 2100 's , 1 Behringer Xenyx 802 dual mic input Mixer , 2 shock mount/broadcast boom combos and 2 windscreens for the same price as a yeti , raidus shock mount , the pop pop filter and a generic mic stand.Now I can replace my mixer and keep my 2 mics , or replace the mics then the mixer and do all sorts of expansions and add ons as well as get quality audio for 2 hosts on my podcast.Do not get this yeti unless your doing youtube voiceovers by yourself forever	-1
I thought it would protect my desk but the pad is almost like that rubber they put under rugs so they wo n't slip around . maybe i should get that for cheaper.I accidently bought LARGE , ooh boy is it ; like , windshield sun reflector size . Sort of just a personal opinion review i suppose .	-1
This pedal is very well constructed but it goes through batteries like CRAZY ! You will want to get a power supply if you opt for this unit.I 'm not too fond of the sound quality of the reverb either- there are a LOT of better sounding units out there but some folks might find it acceptable.Over all I would not recommend this product .	-1
Ok , I 'm surprised that this unit is now over $ 15.00 . I only spent $ 8.59 for this and I 'm mad at myself . It was cheap enough that I rolled the dice to see if I could get away with a decent product for CHEAP . It feels solid , looks like a real direct box ... but sounds like ass . I could n't believe that Pyle would put that much effort into a great `` fit and finish '' product , yet not put decent components inside . This is the noisiest piece of crap I 've ever used - I ended up buying another direct box ( spent over $ 60.00 ) . Pyle has once again lived up to it 's name , but they should finish the name properly and re-brand as `` Pyle of S*** . `` Sorry folks , but I 'd skip this one . The 5-star ratings must be from employees . The only reason I didnt ' give it one star was because it was so cheap ( Remember , I only spent $ 8.59 ) , and I 'm the one that pulled the trigger on the purchase.Live and learn . Why would I think plugging a $ 2000.00 guitar into a cheap piece of crap was a good idea ? My fault .	-1
it is entry level but only records one channel even though it is misleading with multiple inputs and outputs . It works as a beginner tool but only that . mono only .	-1
Big disappointment . I 've been so impressed by Epiphone 's but this one did n't do it . Quality of manufacture and assembly great . Pickups far less than inspiring . Yes , it 's a great platform but was so expecting those P90 sound . I may have received the one in a hundred lemons as so many have commented positively on it . Just did n't have the tone and bite I was expecting.I could certainly invest in some PUP 's but I have too many great P90 guitars to bother . Roll of the dice I guess .	-1
It is built like a tank , but it quit working after a couple of weeks . I have n't made time trouble shoot it yet , so I 'm not sure what component has failed .	-1
kripes man..the one time I go and actually buy a `` honer '' and its a `` bummer '' this thing has 3 keys off tune ! ! I can buy stuff 10 times better quality from Chinaand never have this kinda junk . Maybe it 's a fluke because everyone else gave it a thumbs up and I 'm really not the type a guy to go running stuff down butmaaan Ive never got a harp this trashy B4 ! ... ... all i can say is buy Merana 's for tryin out buy `` suzuki '' or Swan '' from ebay/overseas if yer a poor guy like meand you 'll be better off . Oh btw hot-tip for poor guys again -- - you can get a `` Mississipi River Harp '' for only $ 5.oo if you have a `` Burke 's '' outlet near you ! they 're up by the counter and as good as the high dollar one made by unowho -- -- the Doctah has spoken ! : )	-1
The box contained a bag with just the bottom half of the stand . The top section with the mic thread attachment was missing . Sent it back and did not reorder .	-1
At the time I bought , was $ 16 . Mine arrived broken , so it had gone back . Reality is that it is not that good regardless of mine being broken . Not upset about that - stuff happens . It is just not a good stand . Light construcion , unstable ( topples easily ) and a likely candidate to be broken if dropped . The 'protective ' materails on the stand to keep product from scratching your instrument are the soft , shiny runner like materail and it 'sticks ' to my instrument 's neck . So I pick up uke and I get a stand until the stickiness is seprated by gravity . Happened every time . Yes , I tried out the stand even though broken , and it proved to be a bad choice . Back it has gone . 5 stars to Amazon 's return policy , thouh !	-1
Levy 's leathers could have made this guitar strap out of a softer material , especially on the edges . It cuts into your neck horribly , even thru a shirt . Yukko . The fake leather on the ends are unbelievably cheap .	-1
I got 3 of these to plug XLR cables into the 1/4 & # 34 ; jacks on my board . I got it because my board only has 6 channels with XLR inputs . None of them work . Perhaps I got the wrong thing ?	-1
I bought this for a practice amp for my bass guitar . It showed up on amazon when I was doing a search for `` Bass Guitar amps '' , other regular guitar amps were not showing up so I was curious about it . After a bit of searching online to see if a guitar amp would work for practice situations , I thought I would give it a try because some people say yes , others said no . I wanted to test for myself . While I did get sound and was able to practice , it did n't have anywhere close to the tone I was hoping for . So I ended up returning it the next day . I 'm not upset about the amp itself , just that it shows up as a bass amp off the search , which is the only reason I gave it a shot . For a regular guitar , this would be fine but not bass . I which they would take bass out of the key words or whatever was in there to trigger this to show up . I was in the market for a practice amp for under $ 100 and was hopeful , but what I ended up doing was buying a used Acoustic B20 1X12 Bass Combo Amp for the same price as this new practice amp and I am a lot more satisfied . Again , this review is strictly on the aspect of a bass guitar , not regular guitar .	-1
My advice- spend more and get something that will work with all applications . Cheap midi may get you there , but if not you have to buy another . Yep , always the gamble .	-1
I have finally learned my lesson.I have purchased a number of these over the last year or two.. and previously had the same opinion as reviewers that say `` good for static applications '' as the cable conductors are prone to breakage , even along the length of the cable , not just at the connectors ... But they are dirt cheap so i figured that was ok.But now , after recently buying and installing a cable from a mic in a sound booth to a digital mixer I checked it out and it seemed to work.A week later an acoustic duet came to record and the mic cable made the singer sound like she was singing behind a curtain.. yup..the cable.So by all means buy these on price , but when you get your items..please fully check them out.. a simple `` does it work yes/no '' is clearly not good enough , as i learned	-1
I ca n't say much about this product . I tried it twice . It seemed like it kind of cleaned the strings , but I really did n't notice any great change . The strings did n't sound betteer or brighter . Now , it sits in my drawer and collects dust . Maybe I will try it again at some point , but ... .	-1
This would have been a nice slide if I could get it on my finger . I 'm borderline skinny and it still wo n't fit . Save your money unless your under 10 years old .	-1
not so pleased with the sound quality..sorta disappointed with it over all ... but ya get what ya pay for ... .so i 'll keep it anyway	-1
it 's semi-secure on carpeting or hard floor , but all together I am pretty unsatisfied with this stand . The bottom piece has no way to lock in place , and although with the guitar on it it is more stable , I am not comfortable enough risking my wonderful guitar to something rather flimsy ... I prefer the one that is mounted on the wall as more stable overall . This one ? Meh . Not worth the purchase in my opinion ... booooooooo .	-1
The only reason I 'm not giving this one star is that I did n't expect much for such a low cost pedal . I got this for one of my guitar players so he could use it to switch between clean tones and distortion at our rental practice space before he gets the money to buy a halfstack and decent sounding pedals . We have a punk ska band ( think suicide machines , sublime ) and need to switch a lot in all our songs . I thought this pedal would get us by someway in the meanwhile . NOPE . This pedal sucks your guitar 's tone , and you have to turn the knobs all the way to get anything going , and its not a pleasant sound either way . AVOID .	-1
Bought this for a friend . Cheap plastic enclosure . Affects noticeably your guitars tone and is not exactly a useable delay . He tried to use it for his cleans for our punk ska band but there was no messing with the controls to get a suitable delay . Stay away from this one and get a better used pedal .	-1
I was looking forward to trying these , as I 've loved this company 's product since day one.But I think they 've messed around with the gauge , slapped a meaningless & # 34 ; HD & # 34 ; tag on , and added a few bucks to the price . More profit in someone 's pocket for marketing jargon.I have a smaller-bodied guitar , so these should have , by their claim , given me better balance , but imho , the opposite happened . The bottom dropped out , the top end stopped sizzling , and the middle strings totally took over when I strum with a pick.When I play with fingers it 's better , but not worth spending more money on than the normal .012s I 've been using ( which I think I liked a lot better ) .It 's possible that these work great on the Taylor guitars they were ostensibly designed for ( color me skeptical ) , but I 'd say if you 're happy with what you have , you need not try these.Again , long-time user and big fan , but paying extra money for a slightly different gauge and a silly & # 34 ; HD & # 34 ; moniker ... no thanks .	-1
not two weeks after I put these on the A string broke close to the ball on the string . I break high e strings on occasion . but something as thick as an A string ? ? maybe it was a defective string as I thankfully bought two sets and I was able to pull the A out of the other set and it has been fine since . now however I have the dilemma of should I just buy more strings and just use the second set as I need them . Further more do I stick with the same brand . that is supposed to last longer than average strings . At this point I am going to keep playing this set until its time to change then go from there . I will update once I decide if I should stick with this brand or go back to super slinky'supdate 3/25well another month went by ( a week ago ) and the D string broke in the same fashion leaving me to believe I either got defective strings are these strings are not as good as they are said to be . either way its losing another star . if it happens with a different set of strings I will reevaluate my guitar/review and change accordingly	-1
i got this despite the warnings about it being too short for some people . The strap is about 6 '' too short for my Seagull S6 guitar . I will say the build quality is great but too short , is and remains , too short . I will keep this item and take it to a shoe shop or saddle repair place and have and extendo put into the strap . I just ca n't understand how they can sell this a a guitar strap when it is clearly too short.2/22/2013 I fired off an email to LEVY and the long and `` short '' of all this is you will have to fork over another $ 30 to buy an extendo for this strap . I do n't quite understand why they do n't make the strap long enough to start with other than the fact they can extract another $ 30 to make it work right in the first place . here 's a link to the extendo optionLEVY 'S LEATHERS MMGXL-2.5-BRN STRAP EXTENDER http : //www.amazon.com/LEVYS-LEATHERS-MMGXL-2-5-BRN-STRAP-EXTENDER/dp/B00BH5N91E/ref=sr_1_2 ? ie=UTF8 & qid ; =1361565768 & sr ; =8-2 & keywords ; =MMGXL-2.5 the irony here is I managed to buy the last one for the immediate future.This is just another case of caveat emptor for all buyers to consider . I got the extendo strap and it does not match the original so now I have this cobbled up looking guitar strap . It 's sort of like wearing a suede shoe on one foot and a polished leather shoe on the other . I will keep this strap but sure feel like I 've been had on this purchase ... the terms bait and switch come to my mind .	-1
The mixer is good for the price but I had to return my first one soon after opening it due to some loose parts moving around inside . The packing way below average . As a matter of fact , it was the only outer box without any cushioning . After seeing those UPS and FEDEX delivery videos I would not pack a UPS or FEDEX shipping item in such a poor packing . However , the great seller ( I am referring to AMAZON ) immediately responded and sent me a replacement along with a prepaid label to return the fist unit . Second unit too had the similar packing but no damages . Worked fine .	-1
I 've purchased these locally several times over the past three years at a music store . Mainly due to the low cost . They work okay , but are difficult to keep in tune . The guitars have to be re-tuned often when temperature , humidity , or playing more than ten minutes occurs . My biggest complaint is tarnish and corrosion . Add that to the winding separating over the fret bars exposing the inner solid string , then the strings go `` flat '' sounding . These are not quality strings at all , just cheap Chinese Made quality . They are okay for someone that does n't play often , but if you play daily or as a performer , avoid these strings . Better strings are worth the extra cost . You actually save money by not having to replace them often as you do with these cheap strings . I 've had this problem with all the D'Addario brand strings , both for electric or acoustic , 6 or 12 string guitars . The thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing . The tarnish and corrosion often ends up contaminating the fret bars and keeping the neck dirty all the time . Cleaning after each playing session only makes the strings corrode faster .	-1
When set on blink , they blink way too fast . When not set on blink , all 4 lights come on and focused into just 1 spot that the combined color come out white . Useless design .	-1
This pickguard was used . It not only was missing the protective plastic but it actually was scratched from being on a guitar before .	-1
I purchased this after reading many favorable reviews online and it seemed like a good unit for the price . After trying to use it I promptly returned it . I do sound for concerts and wanted a recorder to connect to the sound board to record shows . I have used a minidisc recorder to do this but wanted something that would easily inferface with my computer . I tried recording on the H2 using it 's line in jack and recording from a line out or tape out my Mackie sound board or my stereo receiver . No matter how I set the levels the recording on the H2 was very distorted . I played with the record levels and the AGC and limiter functions and tried recording from several different audio sources and always got a very distorted signal . I have used my minidisc for the same application for many years and have never had a problem and have always got very clean , good quality sound . The problem with my H2 was that the gain on the mic and line inputs appear to be the same and are meant for a mic level signal , which caused any line level signal to overdrive the preamp . Recording from the internal mics seems to work fine . I have worked with professional sound equipment for over 25 years and the Zoom recorders are the only brand where I have found this problem.The H2 has a nice menu set up and the instructions are very easy to follow but if you want good line level recordings , look for something else . I exchanged this model for an H4n and it had the same problem recording a line level signal , but not as bad as the H2 . I finally ended up getting the Tascam DR-07 which I am very happy with . It has a few less bells and whistles but appears to overall be a better quality recorder .	-1
I bought this to connect a Technics TT with an Audio Technica cartridge to my newer Onkyo receiver with no phono input . The unit did work but I had to turn the volume to 80 ( out of 100 ) to get any reasonable volume . In addition I have an Onkyo M3040 connected to the receiver that I use for as a zone 2 amplifier . With this preamp I am getting some serious spikes into the amp . They are not audible but the lights would dim and the volume from the zone 2 speakers would drop . I do not have this problem with any other source so it appears to be some signal from this preamp.This unit may work perfectly fine with a Behringer mixer but for my use it does n't meet my needs at all . I am returning it .	-1
Do n't know what I expected for such a cheap price , but this product 's quality is in line with its price . Also , the fit over my ukulele 's fretboard is very tight , making it hard to put on and remove .	-1
I bought this hoping to use as intended , angled into guitar & straight into mixer , wrong , have to use it the other way around ... sad !	-1
The plastic knob that you use to tighten the ball and socket does n't grip very well and even the lightest camera will slip and sag . it 's a great idea but not well executed .	-1
I was a little disappointed . Do n't know if it 's a QC problem or if I just got some rejects but out of 6 pots , 1 was out of spec ( 315k ) and 2 were almost out ( 289k , 205k ) . 1 was right on the money and the other 2 were within 10 % . They are CTL 's so I 'm a bit confused . Other than that they work fine , they have the nut , washer and cap included ( no knob ) . I will be upgrading the caps .	-1
I tried the Dean Markley Blue Steel Light accoustic strings on my Takamine guitar , and will soon replace them . On quality control , the high E steel string in the set looks bad with dark spots on it , two of which show after stringing the guitar . String did not break as I rather expected , but it looks bad . On sound , these seemed okay at first , but I still find it hard to keep in tune after a week , especially the high B and E steel strings , which just do n't sound that good to me . And I find the low E wound string notes tend to be too high as I move up the neck , more so than other sets I have used.Guess I 'll go back to D'Addario and Ernie Ball .	-1
wind screen is way too big its bulky and to me useless , the screen came out , was thinking of glueing it back in but went to ebay and bought 2 metal mesh pop filters cheaper that is MUCH better ... avoid this ! !	-1
Considering the price is so cheap on these , I took a chance on this about a year ago for my home hobbyist studio . To say that I used it `` rarely '' is an understatement - maybe once a month when I have friends over for jamming as a way to get my vDrums and a bass DI through my powered wedges . That said , within a year two of the channels stopped working altogether , and the main volume fader became scratchy and jumpy to the point that the volume all the way down would = the volume ALL the way up.Aside from it not working less than a year later , as others have mentioned the lack of a power button combined with the wall wart adapter is a bit of a pain as well . However , if you 're building a studio on a budget and want to roll the dice , it 's a decent little mixer while it works.Pass on this - sound quality is decent for the price , but reliability gets a zero .	-1
this piece of plastic is just terrible . you 'd be better off with a couple of books and a towel.not recommended !	-1
My hopes for this pad was that it would be soft a sqishy on my shoulder . The gel is pretty dense , so it 's kind of hard and squishy and very heavy ! I found that it just added more weight . I 'm not using it . I would look elswhere for a different product .	-1
I started by powering 1 stomp box on this chain and it worked , but when I tried to add a second/third stomp box , I could n't get any guitar sound only a loud buzz . I returned this product I did further testing , I would not recommend it to anyone . With my personal experience in mind , I would advise you to save your money and get a pedalboard power supply . hope this helps	-1
I bought one of each Soft , Medium and Hard Wedgie rubber picks and even though the colours were right , the Hard is as soft as the Soft . They felt exactly the same in fact . The Medium was the hardest out of the bunch.Packaging error ? I have no idea . The fact that each stiffness only comes in one colour and the colours were right lead me to think something is wrong with the manufacturing . So check with what you get.Sound wise , the rubber really removes the treble on my acoustic guitar , making it sound really dull and muted.There is a lot more friction from the rubber on the strings that I do not think it is idea for strumming.The only reason I can think of using is if you want to reduce the noise but frankly , you would have much more control if you used your fingers instead .	-1
I bought this brand because I have one of their mic stand mounts ( for iPhone ) which I like a lot.Pros : The clips did a good job holding my iPad Mini without having to remove the folio type cover ( Marware Axis ) .Quality seems acceptable for the price , the ball swivel works well.Cons : It 's too heavy for my mic stands . I tried it on the boom arm and it made it top-heavy and unstable . If the boom is positioned in a very upright position it 's ok , but a boom pointed up defeats the purpose ! The clamp which holds the base to the stand is big and cumbersome.I had high hopes for this one but it 's not going to work for me . I have returned it and ordered a different ChargerCity model , the one with the lever-type mount .	-1
What was thought to be a DOA model , ended up being a mistake on my behalf . My iPhone 4S , which I have had for about a year now , must 've had enough damage and wear to the dock connector so that it works fine ... unless trying to use the JAM.In The Box : Comes with a simple instruction manual that has about three steps.It comes with the JAM and two cables ( USB and IOS ) . It is bigger than I had imaginedIt 's almost the length of an iPhone . Feels nice , and is very light . The cords are n't very long .	-1
This strap is uncomfortable and too flimsy to feel good , also does n't fit an instrument where there 's no place to hook it . I returned mine , as it just did n't fit well for my uke or mandolin .	-1
I was looking for a portable fold-up stand that I could take to gigs and searched around . Found the Guardian at Amazon and thought for $ 10 , how could I go wrong ? Oops ! Wrong . The stand is sturdy and folds up nicely , but I found it next to impossible to get my Fender Jazz bass to stand up in it . The lack of an extended support for the neck means you have to try to balance the guitar very precisely against the apex of the stand and pray that no one gets near it or that the wind does n't blow . This is OK for a lightweight acoustic that you do n't care too much about , but for for an electric guitar or bass , no way.I just ordered a different one with a tripod base and a neck support . Live and learn .	-1
... what is the sound in the background of the hissssssssssssss ? My guitar I guess , but who cares ? I honestly bought this gizmo for the extremely good hisssssssssssssing nothing else.A question to AMAZON : Companies producing objects that are nothing else than a lemon should n't be prosecuted ? P.S.I think it is `` too polluting '' for 'low cost ' items to waste again in paper box , transportation , restocking work , refund work and so on . This is why 99 % of the time I do not ask for my money back / BUT / sell this lemon on Amazon , online with other websites , and in all the instrument shops worldwide in a total bad faith ( while testing nobody in iRig noticed the overwhelming hisssssssing ? ) well that is beyond me !	-1
Long story short , this string set has a strong metallic character , which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much . Many people might like it , but for me , absolutely Noooooooo ! I have a seagull guitar , so by its nature it sounds mellow , warm and mild with stock strings . So when my strings wear out , I got this . Now I feel like playing an EMG bridge on my fender/archtop 's neck position , WITHOUT the power that an EMG pickup has to offer . Yes , it is that bad , you ca n't do this to guitars like Seagulls ... Bottom line , I recommend this string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar . If you have guitars like seagulls or so , definitely avoid this string .	-1
I picked one of these up when they were being blown out cheaply at a big box store . Who does n't need another pocket tuner to throw in the guitar bag , right ? The price was less than ten bucks , but unfortunately it does n't work very well . The microphone inside the unit is simply not very accurate . It gets you in the ballpark , but just barely . Strike a note once , and it 's sharp . Play the same note with the same force again and it says you are in tune . I think the Korg tuner is in roughly the same price range and it performs the job much better .	-1
One of the ball bearings designed to catch and lock the side mounted to the strap dislodged , and my very expensive Fender Custom Shop Telecaster fell flat on the ground .	-1
This product has an extremely flimsy spring mechanism inside . Upon receiving mine and assembling it , it broke immediately while I was trying to mount an iPad onto it . It also has a fairly narrow angle of adjustability . The metal parts of it seemed sturdy enough but the plastic parts looked and felt brittle .	-1
I ordered two of them and both arrived within a week . I tested both of them , they sound quite good as the majority reviewers said ( that 's why I bought this ! ! ! ) . And they are solidly built too , not one of the pretty light microphone that comes in with cheap karaoke machine.I do n't expect to come with it , so no cable is OK for me.Here is the BUT ... ... : there is no ON/OFF switch , this really pissed me off.But this is my fault , I should have read the 1 star review first.The photo shows no ON/OFF switch , however this does not catch any attention.And all seller seems to have trouble to say `` this product does not have this , does not have that ... '' It only says what the product does have.Oh well , I got stuck with two microphones without ON/OFF switch.I can buy an adapter with on/off switch for microphone .	-1
First time I tried to use it , it broke in my hand . It is now taped together , while I wait for a different kind to replace it .	-1
This was bought based on the advice of others . I had a cable with the standard Neutrik/Switchcraft-type ends fail on me , and this cable was supposed to be either strain free or simply designed for long life because of the strain of usage.It worked great for about 4-6 months , and then broke . It happened so quickly ( the trad types seem to take longer ) that I swore it must have been the output jack on my guitar . After confirming the guitar was okay , I tried a shorter cable , which worked fine.D'Addario does offer lifetime replacement , but it puts you in a bit of a bind - you need a backup cable while you are waiting for a replacement , and you have to pay return shipping of the defective cable out-of-pocket . You also have to get R.A. Taken altogether , this makes it a deal breaker . The extra costs essentially make this cable as expensive as something that has a track record of lasting for years . In my case , I bit the bullet and did what I should have done the first go-round and got a really nice DiMarzio cable.Again , this cable SOUNDS good while it works - capacitance with the longer cables can be an issue . The good news is that IMO high price is not a guarantee of ANY cable sounding good . The replacement DiMarzio is another example of one that was at the top of the list with cable comparisons . I do n't get into the mojo or intangible aspects that will typically find someone paying much more for a cable , but I want durability and published capacitance that is within a certain range . This one meets half of those criteria , but it gets expensive because of the potential to fail sooner rather than later . Well , expensive relative to a cable with an initially higher price but longer lifespan.So the replacement that Planet Waves sent me is now the backup , and is still in the original packaging . I figure I 'll use it only for short periods while replacing my main cable , so it should last a long time in that situation . If I have a few $ for the shipping and D'Addario is still honoring the lifetime warranty if/when the 2nd one breaks , I may get it replaced . More likely I will just chalk it up to a learning lesson and toss it . Even $ 4 shipping is a decent percentage of the cost of a more durable cable - IMO it should be set aside to fund its eventual replacement.If this cable would have last 1.5 to 2 years , I 'd probably give it 5 stars given the price . And if D'Addario took away the warranty thing , it would probably re-shape the customer 's perception on what something at this price should cost , because it 's a wear item , plain and simple . IDK how much R & D ; it 's worth their trouble to put in something at this price point , but that 's is what I would shoot for - a realistically acceptable period of trouble-free use w/no warranty as the trade-off . That would NOT make it a deal breaker .	-1
A great little package for the price , but unfortunately , the zipper failed the first time I tried zipping it up . I have a standard size acoustic guitar , but be aware , the fit was snug , but not tight .	-1
No manual . You can print one off the internet but it should come with one given it 's price . I purchase such so I could lay down a rhythem track then go into the solo while attempting to play live . Do n't believe this is what it is mea n't for . A simple delay looper will suffice . This can do a ton of cool stuff but did not suit my needs .	-1
As soon as I attached my mic , and with my strong hands , I over twisted the mic holder on the threads , and the thread piece came loose on the stand . I think I can fix it with some liquid metal , but this is not as impressive as some mic stands I 've had in the past . Sincerely , DocAfter a few months of trying to make it work . It does n't . I changed my rating from 3 to 1 This puppy is just poor quality .	-1
Ca n't believe they are still selling these things at full price with the old 30 pin connector . I have lots of pads but none still have the old style connector . This is now a boat anchor . To buy a 3 meter cable from them , they charge $ 40 for the cable , $ 15 to ship it and then tax . The extortion here is almost Monster cable like . These folks should be embarassed .	-1
If you 've never had a pedalboard before I 'd say pass on this one and look for one that is more user-friendly . The pics and description do n't show just how insanely large this is . It 's too big . Patch cables are crap and the power supply did n't seem sturdy enough to be kicked around.Besides this , I had trouble using it ( even for practice ) because the lip of the case gets in the way of my foot hitting the pedals.I ended up giving this one away to a friend and getting a Gator 'bone ' and a seperate power supply . Easier to practice with and easier to toss into another case with mics/cables rather than being a whole suitcase on it 's own .	-1
It 's a good ideal but the big problem I have is if Ya are using a tube Amp . ( have a 65 ' Twin Reverb Fender tube ) Ya get one HELL of a HUM . It 's so bad I just ca n't use it at all . I 'm not sure about a transistor Amp . but who uses those ? ? ? ?	-1
I may have misunderstood the product description but I prefer the string tied to the end of my acoustic over this . My issue is that it makes my guitar really high up when I play in a standing position and there is no way to adjust the strap the make it longer . If you play sitting down a lot then this would probably work for you . Do n't get me wrong , there was nothing wrong with the product itself ; it just was n't what I thought .	-1
I love Tascam gear , and have used it for nearly 30 years . I was excited to try out this interface and see what it could do . Unfortunately , I was disappointed.While the construction and mechanical function of the device itself were good , the actual function with the computer left much to be desired . Also , the complete lack of a manual with the one I got made it very difficult understand the functions . ( Sorry , but with a device this expensive and which includes 2 CDs of software , how hard would it be to include a full manual on the install CD ? ) There was a very small quick start guide included , which basically just named the various switches , inputs , and outputs , and gave extremely sparse directions about using the software mixer screen . I was forced into trial and error to see if I could get a serious recording in anything remotely resembling a multi-track mode . I could not . I could record and layer multiple tracks ( I was using Audacity , did n't want to install Cubase ) , but I could not get playback from the previous tracks while I also had live input . Now this could have been my computer or Audacity , as it is an older Win XP machine , but it played back multiple tracks without problem.There was nothing in the mini-quickstart guide to address this , or even hint where one should look , other than going to Tascam 's web site . I 'm sorry , but that is just not good enough with a device this expensive . There should be a complete manual , at least in pdf , included with the product . If I am going to use this to do serious recording , the last thing I want to do is waste huge amounts of time digging information out of a website , or worse , from `` user community '' threads in some blog.Which brings me to another minor complaint - no Linux drivers included . I use mostly Linux , with only one Windows machine for software which I ca n't get on Linux . I wanted to try the software under Wine on Linux but was under time constraints.Then there are the generic problems with software interfaces replacing hardware . With a hardware mixer , I can access as many controls as my fingers can handle ( 3 or 4 on some mixers ) at the same time . Computerized mixers can only do 1 thing at a time , and one must be constantly moving the cursor from one thing to another to access controls . The controls on this interface were very fussy , and you have to position the cursor just exactly on a very small portion of a button to get it to react . I found it very tedious , and again , no actual instructions were included to help with that process . With a touch screen , it might be easier , but then why not just use buttons on a real mixer in that case ? ( Yeah , I know , touch screens are COOL . ) Also , software based functions are always limited by your computer and OS , and that means everyone can have a different experience - consistency is much harder to maintain.I am old school , and find hardware mixers far more responsive and useful . I know that lots of people are all excited about having software versions of hardware in their computers , and saving space , etc. , etc . I value function over fashion , however , and that is what I have always liked about Tascam gear : it was supremely functional . This software falls far short of what I expect from Tascam , and the lack of a manual for the interface is inexcusable.Good mixers , especially for multi-track recording , can be complex and difficult to learn . The layers of signal interconnection can be hard to understand at first , and takes some time to get comfortable with . Old Tascam manuals actually used to have a certain amount of instruction in multi-track recording , which was helpful to aspiring recording artists . Not so here.I had really hoped to give this 3 or 4 stars , but sadly , it only rates a 2 ( 2.5 if I could ) for me . Come on , Tascam , you can do better than this .	-1
Wow , the capture quality of the internal mics is so bad it almost makes me cry , but plug in some real mics and voila- the DR-40 becomes something special ... . But , I do not always want to carry around so much equpment , and was hoping for better internal mics.Honestly , my super cheap Olympus pocket recorder sounded better than this thing.And WHY is the line-out so darn noisy ! ? Must be defective . Oh well ... Gon na , have to send this back .	-1
Just use a cloth or paper towel .	-1
There is almost no difference between this and the Snark SN-1 , and by that I mean the design flaws . You have to constantly adjust the neck to get a reading , and they eat batteries like crazy . The Snark SN-8 is far superior .	-1
I ordered these stands hoping that they would be better than the price indicated . However , the bag was ripped in 3 places . The stands were both scratched badly with lots of paint missing . The most annoying thing was that they did not match each other . The locking mechanism was different on each stand and they were different heights . The holes in the inner poles were drilled in different places so in order to use the support pins and have the speakers at the same height , you had to adjust the legs to accommodate the difference in height . They looked like they might be relatively solid but I returned them anyway ... bit disappointing .	-1
allotoday went to the stores to TEST out the followingtascams ... dr 05 , dr 07 mk2 , and dr 40 and , for myself , ended up buying nothing ... their differences for YOUR ears ... are ... .dr 05 , this is a good quality toy ...

If you expect to get what you pay for , prepare to be disappointed . Sounds weak . Sounds old . Sounds worn . Sounds dull . I wanted to experience a new brand on my Stratocaster . I can afford to pay twice as much . But I am going to keep using my D'adario Strings from now on . I am so disappointed . These strings are for the & # 34 ; campfire guitarist & # 34 ; not the aggressive picking thrilling , tapping , pull offs , or sweepers . If you are a tone fanatic keep looking . If your guitar deserves the best , do not betray your instrument or insult your tube amp with these strings . Respect your GUITAR . I would n't be surprised if they are made from China .	-1
Sadly , I ca n't review the mic itself nor the cable that comes with the mic as they were both non-responsive . I tried the mic with other cables I have lying around that I know work , and I got nothing ; it was like the mic was n't plugged in at all . And the cable included in this pack , well , the plastic ( not metal ) connector to the mic was cracked . I still tried it with a difference mic ... static.I ca n't blame Amazon for the broken bits as the whole thing was packed well and the box did not appear damaged.The stand that comes with this set up seems really good for the price of the whole package . I was impressed at how much of is *isn't* plastic.Still ... I ca n't recommend this product .	-1
I 've two of these stands . On one of them , the base part of the tubing has lost its tack weld . If you carefully separate the pie slice shaped black foam from the base of the stand , you 'll see that the base of the tubing is welded there . Mine lost its weld , so the tubing is not secure to the grey base - they separate - I was left holding the tubing while the grey base fell to the floor ! UPDATE : 1/9/12 GLEN INGLES REFUSES TO REPLACE OR REPAIR THE STAND . BEWARE ! ... and you should be aware that the stand is assembled in ... ... ... ... ..wait for it ... ... ... ... ... .China . That may explain why it failed , but Glen Ingles could have offered to replace it . I guess he does n't want me to buy any more of his products , or refer others to his products . Well , that 's his policy . That 's okay , he 's got competition , and I 'll be purchasing from them instead .	-1
Bought it after read reviews . I had signal loss using these cables.. it 's like having a loose connection inside the cable . My connections were on and off , I thought I had a dead pedal.. I have to wiggle and hold to get signal . It 's too flexible almost like Twizzlers ( no kidding ! ) . If you want a cheap and reliable pedal cables , go get the one from Pro Co , I bought it very cheap from Sweetwater on Ebay , surprisingly very good quality and looks durable !	-1
These picks do cut pick noise but with an acoustic guitar they wear very rapidly and leave a rubbery residue all over my guitar . I do n't like the thought of what damage that stuff would do over time to the inside of my guitar with that stuff getting all over my pickups , etc . Big disappointment . I 'm getting a lot of high string in my guitar sound and thought these picks might solve the problem . Back to the drawing board I go .	-1
I bought the wrong gauge . I read a review that said that you should get a size less then you really want but they are wrong . I bought the .90 gauge at Guitar Center and love them . These were made for that Dave Mustain muted crunch sound . I do n't know if I will use these forever but for right now I love them . Just hard enough for speed picking but light enough to stay in your hand without moving around like 1 mils do.Dunlop Ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like new.Buy em ! ! ! !	-1
Returned this item because the zipper was already broken when I received it . Not durable ! Spend a few more dollars , it is worth it .	-1
Not much better than the dollar version of the peg winder . Thought it would be more ergonomic and having the stringer cutter in one tool would be a plus ... . but , not quiet up to par . You 'll be better off with the dollar string winder and a cheap pair of snips .	-1
The coversion cable didnt work . t is axlr to UBS cable . I have the red blinking light syndrome also . But I learned awhile back dont try to fix something you paid for Send it back . So izm Thanks HDE for wasting my time . Go sell your snake oil to someone else ... ... ...	-1
I got a few of these as a Christmas gift and they 're just bad . I put them on my pedalboard where I previously had longer cables and these just did n't stay in the jack . I have no other problems with these jacks with any other cable but these . If I play loudly and my room vibrates a bit , the cable even works its way out of the jack a little bit and cuts my signal . Awful .	-1
Ca n't hold tightly on 1st string ( low C ) , a little buzz .	-1
Its poorly made with attention to detail . I ordered them to fit on my dual mic clamp purchased here at Amazon . But they will not screw down all the way and are losse . It is useless ! ! ! Other mic holders from different manufacturers work fine .	-1
I got one of these from another source but have returned it for exchange because of the following issue : when I record a track either with the `` Audio Recorder '' or `` Guitar Amp '' screens in Garageband on my iPad 3 , iOS7 , the recording is great . But once I toggle over to the multitrack view and attempt to play the recording just made , there is godawful distortion and the audio is completely unlistenable . Here 's the other part of this : I can use Apogee Jam guitar interface , and iRig Pre microphone interface and Garageband behaves as it should and I can play the multitrack view with no problems whatsoever . The Focusrite support folks suggested I do a backup of my iPad contents and then do a software restore but I opted to return the unit instead , since the Apogee and iRig both work perfectly with Garageband . So , I do n't know if the unit is having a problem with iOS7 or I just happened to get a lemon but I 'll find out when the new one comes next week . If it works correctly , I 'll update this review after doing a few recordings . But , I would say if you 've just updated to iOS7 or are thinking about it and you want to get this unit , you might want to hold off on that upgrade . UPDATE : Got a replacement unit and even did a restore on my iPad , as suggested by a Focusrite support tech , and STILL have the problem I discussed above . So , this product simply has turned out to be a dud for me . If anyone else has a similar issue with this and find a resolution , please let me know .	-1
The concept of this guitar stand is great , and I thought it would be perfect for my two Telecasters ... That is until I get the stands in place and put the guitars in them . The stands have a very deep angle , and from what I could tell , the guitars were sitting about 40 to 45 degrees back.It just looks silly , like your guitars are trying to slip out of the stand , or are in a slow-motion fall backwards . It also ends up taking up WAY too much space , as the stand has to be set out from the wall or corner quite a bit for clearance purposes . I ended up returning these stands , but would definitely buy again if they produced a more upright version .	-1
This pedal , in short , sucks . There 's no point to having an A/B pedal if it adds a huge amount of hiss to your sound . Behringer needs to go back to the drawing board with this .	-1
There is a problem with the design . When you move the head , the 3 little plastic pieces that hold the ball that allows you to rotate the head , just break off . The tuner itself is great , but the product fails because it broke in 5 minutes .	-1
The unit I received did not work . I returned it . I like the other joyo pedals I ordered so I am going to give this one another shot .	-1
Total flimsy junk . It leans WAYYY too far back . I 'll be damned if I put my $ 1000 guitars on these things . On the other hand , ChromaCast makes one that 's very close to this price , and I doubt that it could have been more for the money I paid.In summary ... DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK .	-1
This works in some applications , but does n't work in many others . Even when detected by the software , it will not work with Line 6 equipment . Too bad , because it would have been convenient to program my effects with my laptop instead of my desktop .	-1
These look so neat that my brother and I both unknowingly ordered these for each other as gifts last Christmas . Unfortunately they feel too chunky to use and the colored tip grips the strings in an unfortunate way making it difficult to play .	-1
I 'd give this 1 and a half stars if I could . This little Amp is so noisy if you hardly touch/move a cable plugged into it . It is so hard to get full sound in head/earphones with this . I can only hear in one ear in every headphone/output , and hardly anything in the other . I have to always adjust my cable 's connector to get any full sound for a second . I can still use this , but hardly . I really do n't like this .	-1
The device itself is difficult to read in bright light.My first one arrived not working at all.The second one arrived with a low battery . What ? After three days the battery goes out.I would have returned it , but lost it because it does n't adhere to the headstock very well . You 've been warned .	-1
No where on the description does it say that the mic clip is NOT included . The only place is on the box AFTER you have received the item . There 's no instruction ( which is fine ) . But in the product description it does n't say that you must purchase the mic clip separately or you ca n't use it.I bought this and have it shipped second day because I need to use it and now I ca n't because it does n't come with a Mic Clip which I have to spend another 5-10 to get it plus shipping . The price is the stand is reasonable had it included the mic clip . But without it , I felt cheated .	-1
